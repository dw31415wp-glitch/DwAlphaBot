That’s not the rhetorical excess of the mainstream press, nor is it the cynical spin of a political rival. It’s just what Trump said."

The [[#Operation World, Joshua Project and Asia Harvest]] are databases of religion demographics related to the Christian missionary movement. OW and the JP are both edited by the Christian missionary Patrick Johnstone, while AH, which reproduces OW-JP statistics for Asia and China, is edited by the Christian missionary Paul Hattaway. The JP has been the subject of more than ten discussions on this noticeboard, with almost all comments finding it completely unreliable. The latest [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_361#RfC:_Joshua_Project|discussion with RfC in 2021]] decided its inclusion in the perennial sources' list as a generally unreliable source. Despite this, it is still widely used throughout Wikipedia (cf. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?limit=500&offset=0&profile=default&search=insource%3A%22joshuaproject.net%22&title=Special:Search&ns0=1 1]), and its associated projects OW and AH are also widely used (cf.

*'''Option B''': One aggregate table, with a section outlining the differences in the question put.

The immediate cause of the violence Manogaran finds is rumor of Sinhalese policemen been attacked in Jaffna by Tamil militants.

It would have a maximum length of two sentences. Subsequent developments after her comments themselves (police report etc) would not be included. The comments Rowling made on Willoughby in March are separate from those made on several transgender people including Willoughby on April Fools' Day. I'm almost certain her comments in March were the first times Rowling publicly misgendered a trans person.

In the RfC that this guideline is based on, it seems to be taken for granted that endorsements by notable individuals that are not covered by reliable and independent sources fail the inclusion criteria, but endorsements by notable organizations inherently merit inclusion. Somebody raised this important point in [[Wikipedia_talk:Political_endorsements#RfC_on_Part_2_2|a prior RfC]] but received no meaningful answer. Here's a more airtight example:
*[[Geert Wilders]] tweets his endorsement of [[Christine Chandler]] for her reelection. No journalists cover it, so we do not mention it.
*The [[Party for Freedom]], of whom Wilders is [[Party_for_Freedom#Organisation_and_support|the sole member]], endorses Chandler in a press release on their website. It is inherently reliable and therefore included because the PVV is a group.

Two versions have been proposed, and we seek wider community input on which should be included in the article.

Three related questions:

a) Can this article include non-medical information about Havana Syndrome (provided the information is properly sourced)? Examples of non-medical information include politics, economics, relationship to cold war, espionage, directed energy weapons,  statements by foreign governments, conflict-of-interest allegations, and historical chronology of hypotheses & research.  Example of non-medical information:  Financial compensation from ''Havana Act'' <ref name=BarnesOct8>{{cite news |first1=Julian E. |last1=Barnes |first2=David E. |last2=Sanger |first3=Katie |last3=Rogers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/us/politics/havana-syndrome-biden-law.html |title=Biden Signs Legislation to Compensate Victims of Mysterious 'Havana Syndrome' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211018154415/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/us/politics/havana-syndrome-biden-law.html |archive-date=October 18, 2021 |work=The New York Times |date=October 8, 2021}}</ref> and <ref name="Collins Bill">{{Cite web|date=May 25, 2021|title=S.1828 - HAVANA Act of 2021|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1828/text?r=3&s=1|publisher=United States Congress|access-date=June 25, 2021|archive-date=June 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210625134327/https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1828/text?r=3&s=1|url-status=live}}</ref>.

b) Can this article include USA government reports, studies and statements from the executive branch, US Congress, CIA, Department of Defense, State department, National Institutes of Health, etc. (provided they are reported on by major media)? Specifically, is it okay if some sources are ''not'' from medical or scientific journals?   Examples of government reports:  <ref name="JASON2021">{{cite web |title=An Analysis of Data and Hypotheses Related to the Embassy Incidents |url=https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/JASON-Study-Revised_10-February-2022-Redacted_V1.1.pdf |website=state.gov |publisher=United States Department of State |access-date=October 19, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221014084219/https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/JASON-Study-Revised_10-February-2022-Redacted_V1.1.pdf |archive-date=October 14, 2022 |language=en-US |date=February 10, 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref> and  <ref>"Most ‘Havana Syndrome’ Cases Unlikely Caused by Foreign Power, C.I.A. Says" Julian Barnes  20 Jan 2022, ''NY Times'' https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/us/politics/havana-syndrome-cia-report.html"</ref>.

c) For medical information in this article:  does [[WP:MEDRS]] prohibit the use of primary medical sources in this article?  Opposing view: Havana Syndrome is relatively new and evolving so it is okay to use primary medical sources in some situations (for example,  when the primary source is widely reported in major media; or when the primary source is reporting a significant new result; or when there are no secondary sources yet available that have reviewed and summarized the primary source).

In antiquity, it was home to several [[Canaan|Canaanite]], and later, [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Israelite and Judahite]] states, and is referred to as the Land of Israel in [[Jewish culture|Jewish tradition]]. Situated at a continental crossroad, the [[southern Levant]] subsequently came under the rule of different empires, such as the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]], [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]], [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]], [[Hellenistic Kingdoms|Hellenistic]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Byzantine]], [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]], [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]], [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]], [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]], [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader]], [[Ayyubid]], [[Mamluk Egypt|Mamluk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires. The late 19th century saw the rise of [[Zionism]] in Europe, a movement seeking a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish homeland]], which garnered [[Balfour Declaration|British support]] during [[World War I]]. During the war, [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration|British occupation]] led to the setting up of [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1920.

Define the threshold in national polls to include candidates in the infobox

'''You must only choose one option.'''

A) 15%

B) 10%

C) 5%

I believe that a previous RfC that addressed the minimum number in national polls that candidates should have to be included in the infobox is ambiguous and don't provide a clear and solid consensus. Several of the users who participated in that RfC did not fully decide on 5% or 10%

I think the threshold in polls must be 15% nationwide, the same threshold that the Commission on Presidential Debates imposes on third party candidates in order for them to participate in debates. Third party candidates tend to be above 5% in the months leading up to the election and drop off as election day approaches. A very clear example was candidate Gary Johnson in 2016. In the months leading up to the election polls consistently showed him above 5%, there were even several polls that had him above 10%. However, Gary Johnson only received 3% of the nationwide vote.

I would like to restart a previous RfC on calling the operation a Hamas victory in the infobox.

No consensus was reached in the past RfC however I think the decision then was erroneous. Most of the opponents had no compelling arguments except essentially appeals to emotion that the attacks were "terrorist" and that it would somehow be immoral to call "terrorists" winners. That RfC was further tainted by an e-mail canvassing situation. I believe that the closer erred in his judgement of no consensus. {{Ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha

I think it's time for us to have this discussion.

Specifically, I propose that the current version "{{tq|Israel's practices in its occupation of the Palestinian territories have drawn sustained international criticism along with accusations that it has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity against the Palestinian people from human rights organizations and United Nations officials.}}" be replaced with "{{tq|Israel's practices in its occupation of the Palestinian territories have drawn sustained international criticism.

I have noticed that a new convention has formed regarding the ideology parameter, which is to only put one or two all-encompassing ideologies (see [[Labour Party (UK)]]). It used to be the case that the ideology parameter had five or so more specific entries that gave the reader a good impression of the party at a glance (see [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]). 

In light of this, I think a 'Key positions' parameter would be a good addition which has, say maximum five entries which editors agree on, including regarding their order, and they would be based on citations from recent academia. The policy on this could distinguish between social, economic, national, and international positions to ensure a wide coverage. A national one could be say Unionism for a UK party, and an international one could be Euroscepticism for a European party. 

The name 'Key positions' is problematic as there are political jobs also called positions, however I can't think of a better term. Maybe 'Political positions'?

This RfC is a continuation of the discussion regarding the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 UK general election]] and the question on which parties to include in that page's infobox. For some context, there has been a longstanding debate on whether UKIP - which received a seat and was the third most voted for party - should be listed. Currently, the consensus from the [[Talk:United Kingdom general election, 2015/Archive 7#Request for Comment: Which Infobox? (Choice of Two)|most recent RfC]] on the topic is to not include UKIP, but the inherent controversial nature of this decision has meant that debates and occasional edit-wars have sprouted up in the years since, with no full resolution in sight.

This RfC is hopefully an attempt to solve this controversy and to provide more clarity to the longstanding [[Wikipedia:Five percent rule|5% rule guideline]] surrounding election infoboxes.

The main questions to be discussed are:

*What criteria, hard or soft, should be met by parties to be included in an infobox? This includes having >5% of the popular vote, earning a parliamentary seat, media noteworthiness, etc. Along with this, are there times that a party meeting some or all of these criteria should ''not'' be included in the infobox? If so, why, and when?
*Should the 5% rule, or some approximation of it, be applied to parliamentary elections? There have been discussion held on this topic in [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Elections and Referendums/Archive 20#RfC: Expanding 5% infobox threshold|2021]] and [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Elections and Referendums/Archive 24#RfC: Clarify the 5% rule for parliamentary elections|2023]], but no formal consensus on whether it should actually apply in some form, either weakly or strongly, to parliamentary election infoboxes has occurred.
*How should the choice between the {{[[Template:Infobox election|Infobox election]]}} and {{[[Template:Infobox legislative election|Infobox legislative election]]}} templates be made? Should it be contingent on >9 parties meeting all the criteria listed above, or should it be more dependent on local conditions? There are inconsistencies between countries - and even between different elections of the same country - on the infobox style used, so it would be valuable to have this issue more formally clairfied.

I believe the previous discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Brothers_of_Italy#RfC_on_neo-fascism_in_info_box_3_(Effectively_option_4_from_RfC2) here] was not all that productive (it didn't involve all that much analysis of sources, and there was only I believe 4 or so active editors in the discussion (which is why I've added the RFC template to this discussion)), and that the main argument to remove it was incredibly weak; that argument being, "A majority (or a lot) of sources do not describe the party as neo-fascist." '''That. does. not. matter.''' Said sources often describe the party as national conservative and or right-wing populist. These are not mutually exclusive with fascism, infact, right-wing populism is one of the core tenets of fascism. (13, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism#Umberto_Eco here] which links to right-wing populism.) Nor is national conservatism mutually exclusive with fascism, and in fact italian neo-fascist parties (most notably MSI) are listed as also being national conservative here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_conservatism#Defunct_or_formerly_national_conservative_parties,_or_parties_with_national_conservative_factions here]. '''Please do not repeat this argument.''' Sources merely not labelling the party as neo-fascist do not matter, '''what does matter, however''' is the sources which outright reject the neo-fascist label. There are plenty of sources that don't describe birds as being dinosaurs, but that doesn't mean they aren't. Additionally, sources highlighting the parties roots in fascism are not neccesarily rejecting that they curron ently are, instead it's merely highlighting the historical aspect.[[User:A Socialist Trans Girl|<span style="font-family:default;color:#246BCE;">A Socialist</span>]] [[User talk:A Socialist Trans Girl|<span style="font-family:default;color:#FF1493;">Trans Girl</span>]] 07:20, 7 July 2024 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
While browsing through articles on subdivisions of [[Cologne]] with the intention of adding translations from German Wikipedia, I noticed that the terms used to translate different levels of subdivision are inconsistent across these pages. The overview article [[Districts of Cologne]] translates {{lang|de|Stadtbezirk}} as "(city) district", and {{lang|de|Stadtteil}} very literally as "city part". Articles about individual {{lang|de|Stadtbezirke}} on the other hand, like [[Lindenthal, Cologne|Lindenthal]] and [[Rodenkirchen]] instead render {{lang|de|Stadtbezirk}} as "borough" and {{lang|de|Stadtteil}} as either "(city) quarter" "city part".

By way of comparison, articles on [[Berlin]], which calls its top-level subdivisions {{lang|de|Bezirk}} and its second-level subdivisions {{lang|de|Ortsteil}} (which meanings do not differ substantially from {{lang|de|Stadtbezirk}} and {{lang|de|Stadtteil}}), uses "borough" for the former and "locality" for the latter.

This is confusing in several different ways:

* Readers may take a minute to work out that what some articles call a "borough" is the same thing other articles call a "district".
* The literal translation "city part" for {{lang|de|Stadtteil}} sounds vague and doesn't really convey any scale or significance to the reader. It also sounds a bit "awkward" to my mind. The term "locality" used for {{lang|de|Ortsteil}} is less awkward, but no less vague.
* The use of "quarter" for ''Stadtteil'' is wholly nonsensical as the ''Stadtteile'' themselves can be further subdivided informally into {{lang-de|(Stadt)viertel}} / {{lang-ksh|Veedel}}, which literally translates as..."(city) quarter". Berlin articles use "neighbourhood" for such further, informal subdivisions of their ''Ortsteile''.

I would like to propose the following consistent approach for the subdivisions of German cities:

* {{lang|de|(Stadt)bezirk}} or other top-level division to be rendered as '''borough'''
* {{lang|de|Stadt-/Ortsteil}} or other second-level division to be rendered as '''district'''
* {{lang|de|Viertel}} or other (usually informal) third-level division to be rendered as '''neighbourhood''' except in proper nouns{{ref|1|note}} (e.g. {{lang|de|Severinsviertel}} → "Severin Quarter", {{lang|de|Belgisches Viertel}} → "Belgian Quarter")

Subjectively, as a binative of English and German, this is what seems most intuitively comprehensible/evocative, but there are also objective reasons speaking for it:

# The [https://www.stadt-koeln.de/leben-in-koeln/stadtbezirke/index.html City of Cologne's official web page on its subdivisions] alongside [https://www.stadt-koeln.de/artikel/68982/index.html this official map of {{lang|ksh|Veedel}}] uses precisely this borough-district-neighbourhood schema while retaining "quarter" for proper nouns ([https://www.stadt-koeln.de/leben-in-koeln/planen-bauen/bebauungsplaene/63948/index.html example])
# Berlin likewise officially uses [https://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/en/the-senate/political-structure/ "boroughs" for {{lang|de|Bezirke}}] and [https://www.berlin.de/en/districts/ "districts and neighbourhoods" for {{lang|de|Ortsteile}} and their subdivisions]
# The borough-district schema has also been used for translating [[Stockholm]]'s top-level {{lang|sv|stadsdelsområden}} and second-level {{lang|sv|stadsdelar}}, the latter even being cognate with {{lang|de|Stadtteile}}.

However, I didn't want to charge ahead and make these changes without first inviting comment to see if there might be any good reasons this isn't already what's used across the board.

Excuse me, This is the latest photo of Trump that I proposed because when I saw the photo of Trump that I proposed previously, many people thought that the background of the photo was strange, the tie was yellow, and the face was arrogant because he was not smiling. Therefore, I propose this new photo of Trump which has an upright body and a straight head. In addition, the photo of Trump that I proposed has a smiling face and his teeth are visible which is very fitting when juxtaposed with the photo of [[Kamala Harris|Harris]] who is also smiling and her teeth are visible. Then the photo that I proposed also has a background that is not strange and uses a red tie. For the problem of Trump's face looking old, of course because Trump is currently 78 years old.

While trying to formulate my opinion on the subject, I found that neither discussion above (''Asking for consensus: Freeze in compromise version until discussion is resolved'' and ''Should Kamala Harris be listed as a "border czar"'') is very clear as to any proposed changes. So, I am making this section for !votes and discussion on specific versions. Here are the options (taken from the above discussions):
*'''Option 1:''' ''No mention.'' This is the state of the article at this moment.
*'''Option 2:''' ''Disputed mention.'' This new state would put "(disputed)" after Harris' name, with a footnote going into some depth concerning the history of Harris being called "border czar".
*'''Option 3:''' ''Normal mention.'' This was the original listing (note—by "original listing" is meant the original addition of the text to the page), with the only difference between Harris' and others' being a footnote stating that her presidential campaign has disavowed the title.
 
Option 2 was developed as a compromise between Option 1 and Option 3, given the unusual disagreement over the use of the title. Option 3 treated the media mentions of Harris as border czar as sufficient, followed by the chronologically later disavowal. The supporters of Option 1 have several justifications, mainly (so far as I can see) that the title has always been a source of controversy, ever since President Biden gave her the diplomatic responsibility, and that she has now formally disavowed the title. Wrapped up in this latter argument is the political connection, given that most people who want to bring up the "border czar" title are doing so to the detriment of her campaign.

This RfC proposes to change references in the article from Serbian terms such as '''"Metohija"''' and '''"Šar Mountains"''' to their Albanian equivalents, '''"Dukagjin"''' and '''"Sharr Mountains"''', respectively. The article currently utilizes Serbian terminology that may not reflect the linguistic preferences of the majority of Kosovo's citizens, who predominantly speak Albanian. Over 90% of the population in Kosovo identifies as Albanian, making it imperative that the language used in the article accurately represents the voices and perspectives of the majority of its people.

Using terms that resonate with the local population aligns with Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] (NPOV) policy. The NPOV guideline emphasizes that articles should represent significant viewpoints fairly and proportionately. Since the Albanian language is the primary language spoken by the majority in Kosovo, adopting Albanian terminology helps to present an accurate portrayal of the region’s cultural and linguistic identity.

In conclusion, I propose to change the following terms in the article:

In March, a [[Talk:2024 United States presidential election/Archive 7#Biden and Trump pictures|consensus]] was established not to use [[:File:Donald Trump official portrait.jpg|Trump's official presidential portrait from 2017]] (right) in the infobox for this article. However, since then, editors have been [[Talk:2024_United_States_presidential_election/Archive_10#Trump_image_RfC|unable to decide on ''which'' photo to use as a replacement]] (alternative options below), and some editors have expressed support for using the 2017 portrait for at least one of the following reasons:

# They never supported switching away from the 2017 portrait in the first place
# They think that reverting to the 2017 portrait would resolve the ongoing disagreements about which photo to use as a replacement

Hello,
Regarding Trump's main photo of "2024 United States presidential election", there were several discussions previously. - example link:
[[Talk:2024_United_States_presidential_election/Archive_7]]
I'd like to confirm which photos can be used. I've included the top-voted options based on my understanding, but I think limiting it to three additional choices will give us the most efficient results. If a new, better image emerges, we can compare it after this RFC process

:*For this RFC process, I propose that we only allow users to vote for one best photo for the Infobox  [[Donald Trump|Trump]]'s main photo. This will simplify calculations, as it's easier to determine the winner based on a single vote per user.

* '''Official'''
>Every U.S. elections always using official portrait but not in presidential primaries, for example, in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], Bill Clinton's official portrait was used for 2 times although two times were sequence 4 years ago.  weakness of this photo: considering that the age is a concern among some voters, the images of relatively recent can minimise that concern. Trump's 2017 portrait doesn't show a drastically different Trump/no change in appearance.
* '''Option1'''
>the long-standing "smug"  image; This can be seen as an unkind and arrogant, but on the other hand, it can be seen as a confident looking
*  '''Option2'''
>it is smiling freindly photo with his face,like Kamala  but  Trump's expression in the his body is tilted to the left instead of facing the camera.
*  '''Option3'''

>it is smiling freindly photo and suitable camerawork - example: at eye level, face and body facing camera and he is also smiling like Kamala but there's just an impression that makes him look uneasy.

The current [[Hamas#Recognition_of_Israel|Recognition of Israel]] section contains the following elements:

1. '''Whether Hamas would recognize Israel is debated'''.[142][143][144] Hamas leaders have emphasized they do not recognize Israel,[77] but indicate they "have a de facto acceptance of its presence".[145] Hamas's acceptance of the 1967 borders acknowledges the existence of another entity on the other side.[130] Some scholars believe Hamas's acceptance of the 1967 borders implicitly recognizes Israel.[131][146]

2. '''According to Martin Kear, Israel treats "any form of resistance from Palestinians as acts of terrorism", and therefore responds to any resistance with extraordinary force. In contrast, writes Kear, Hamas operationalizes "...its resistance to Israeli occupation through its invocation of jihad ... Accordingly, Hamas refuses to recognise Israel as a legitimate actor..."'''[148] However, Kear goes on to note that without expressly stating it Hamas agreed to respect the Oslo Accords, and by extension Israel's existence: "The signing of the 2007 Mecca Agreement also meant that Hamas had met two of the three stipulations set down by Israel and the Quartet: recognising Israel and respecting all previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements."[148]

3. Graham Usher said that while Hamas did not consider Israel to be legitimate, it accepted Israel as political reality.[149] Tareq Baconi explains that Hamas' implicit recognition of Israel is in contrast to most Israeli political parties who have long opposed the idea of a Palestinian state.[150][145]

'''Option 1''': Keep all three elements as they are

'''Option 2''': Remove or alter one of the three elements, specify which exactly and how you wish to alter it (remove entirely, add something to it, etc.)

'''Option 3''': Remove or make additions to all three elements, for example, remove line 1, keep the truncated version of the Kear quote without any additional information, add year specification to Usher and remove Baconi (or if possible, include RS with alternate opinions)

In my personal opinion, the lede doesn't really need to include the genocides. For example, [[Japan]]'s featured article doesn't mention the events in WW2. At least we should only say "Christian" instead of listing all the ethnic groups for the ones commited by the Ottomans. Perhaps even the ones committed to the Muslims are unnecessary. So, here are the options:

'''Option 1:''' "In the 19th and early 20th centuries, [[persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction]] and [[Persecution of Muslims#Russian Empire|in the Russian Empire]] resulted in large-scale loss of life and [[Muhacir|mass migration into modern-day Turkey]] from the [[Balkans]], [[Caucasus]], and [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]]. Under the control of the [[Three Pashas]], the Ottoman Empire [[Ottoman entry into World War I|entered World War I]] in 1914, during which the Ottoman government committed [[Late Ottoman genocides|genocides]] against its [[Armenian genocide|Armenian]], [[Greek genocide|Greek]], and [[Assyrian genocide|Assyrian]] subjects." (it will stay as it is)

'''Option 2:''' "In the 19th and early 20th centuries, [[persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction]] and [[Persecution of Muslims#Russian Empire|in the Russian Empire]] resulted in large-scale loss of life and [[Muhacir|mass migration into modern-day Turkey]] from the [[Balkans]], [[Caucasus]], and [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]]. Under the control of the [[Three Pashas]], the Ottoman Empire [[Ottoman entry into World War I|entered World War I]] in 1914, during which the Ottoman government committed [[Late Ottoman genocides|genocides]] against its [[Christianity in the Ottoman Empire|Christian]] subjects." (shortening)

'''Option 3:''' "In the 19th and early 20th centuries, [[persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction|persecution of Muslims]]  resulted in large-scale loss of life and [[Muhacir|mass migration into modern-day Turkey]]. Under the control of the [[Three Pashas]], the Ottoman Empire [[Ottoman entry into World War I|entered World War I]] in 1914, during which the Ottoman government committed [[Late Ottoman genocides|massacres]] against its [[Christianity in the Ottoman Empire|Christian]] subjects." (more shortening)

'''Option 4:''' "Under the control of the [[Three Pashas]], the Ottoman Empire [[Ottoman entry into World War I|entered World War I]] in 1914." (all the migration, massacre and genocides are removed from the article.)

'''Other:''' something else I missed.

The maps of time zones in Wikipedia ([[:File:World Time Zones Map.svg|SVG]], [[:File:World Time Zones Map.png|PNG]]) show the time actually observed in each area, ''de facto'', regardless of legality.

Similarly, the maps show the occupied regions of Ukraine and the separatist regions of Georgia in UTC+3, which is the time enforced by the Russian or separatist authorities there. Previous discussions about this topic resulted in keeping the map ''de facto'', including the occupied or separatist regions in UTC+3, but many users continue to complain about it, so I'm restarting the discussion here. '''How should the maps show the time zones of the occupied regions of Ukraine and separatist regions of Georgia?''' You may answer differently for each region.

Please note that the maps still show these regions as part of Ukraine and Georgia, with the international borders as generally recognized. The question here is only regarding the time zones. For reference, the IANA time zone database includes Crimea in UTC+3, but it doesn't mention the other occupied regions of Ukraine or the separatist regions of Georgia.

Also please write the extent to which you support the other proposals. Please don't reply to others in the survey section. Please don't just write an option without any reasoning for it.

'''Option 1:''' It should should describe it as 'a Liberal poltical ideology that supports things such as a welfare state, mixed economy, etc'.

'''Option 2:''' It should should omit the 'is a movement within' part in favour of the lede sentence, instead describing it as 'a political ideology that supports things such as a welfare state, mixed economy, etc'.

'''Option 3:''' It should describe it as a socialist political ideology, as it does now [status quo].

'''Option 4:''' It should should describe it as 'a democratic poltical ideology that supports things such as a welfare state, mixed economy, etc'

{{rfcquote|text=
Comments would be appreciated to achieve an accurate and supportable consensus regarding references to Storrs-Mansfield, Connecticut - an unincorporated village which is sometimes referred to as Storrs. The community is notably home to the main campus of the University of Connecticut, and, naturally reflects cultural differences both as a New England fixture but also due to some misplaced or incorrect historical usage.

The request would be to alter the lead section of the article to read as follows:

{{quote|text='''Storrs-Mansfield''' ({{IPAc-en|s|t|ɔːr|z| |ˈ|m|æ|n|s|f|i|l|d}} {{respell|storz| |MANS|feeld}}) is an unincorporated village and [[census-designated place]] (CDP) in the [[New England town|town]] of [[Mansfield, Connecticut|Mansfield]] in eastern [[Tolland County, Connecticut|Tolland County]], [[Connecticut]], United States. The community is part of the [[Capitol Planning Region, Connecticut|Capitol Planning Region]].<br><br>Sometimes referred to as '''Storrs''', the village is dominated economically and demographically by the main campus of the [[University of Connecticut]] and the associated [[Connecticut Repertory Theatre]].}}

Several points of discussion, including the preference and differences between census-designated place boundaries and postal town boundaries are included on the article talk page. It is not appropriate to immediately dismiss the need for a new consensus, due to the substantial official and community usage of both names - [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)#Alternative names|WP:NCPLACE]] and [[MOS:ALTNAME]] support this change:

In the wake of Donald Trump winning the 2024 presidential election, and the sheer number of RS that say that right-wing populism is the dominant faction of the Republican Party, as well as plenty of sources documenting how the Reagan-era conservative faction of the party has lost nearly all of its influence, can we move up right-wing populism to be alongside conservatism as the party's main ideology? @[[User:Toa Nidhiki05|Toa Nidhiki05]]
My personal views: I have written a lot of the section on right-wing populists in the factions section. There is too much to list here. But the key is the party's demographic base shift:
* '''Demographically,''' the Republican Party has lost its prior majority support from White voters with college degrees it had since Eisenhower and Goldwater (1950s & 1960s) to 2012. The party also has roughly 2:1 support from White voters with college degrees. Non-whites are harder to get a good read on, but in 2024 Trump won close to a majority of Hispanic voters, what appears to be a majority of Native American voters, and a significant percentage of Asian American voters. Trump won at most about 15% of African American voters.
Also I created two bar plots of the states Trump and Harris won by educational attainment. Except for New Mexico, every single state Harris won had above-average educational attainment. Trump did win four states (Utah, Pennsylvania, Kansas, and North Carolina) with above-average educational attainment, but his core strength was with below-average educational attainment states. 

It appears that the key dividing line between the two parties is education. The income divide appears to have inverted, with Harris winning a majority of voters who made over $200,000 a year. Trump won 56% of voters without a college degree, and 42% of voters with a college degree. Harris won 56% of voters with a college degree, and 42% of voters without a college degree. These are mirror images of each other. The reason Trump won is 43% of voters have college degrees, and 57% don't.

Note: I am a statistician, and this data comes from the exit polls and Census data. I don't make the data, just analyze it.

There are two news/articles about Assange's speech and mentioned transnational repression.

1.[https://jacobin.com/2024/10/julian-assange-wikileaks-pace "This came at a cost. Assange recounted the legal attacks ('lawfare'), surveillance, and various illegal CIA plots against him, describing it as a form of transnational repression. "]—— Chip Gibbons, [[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]

2.[https://www.rfi.fr/en/international/20241002-european-rights-body-finds-prosecution-of-wikileaks-assange-politically-motivated <nowiki>"The PACE resolution said it was 'alarmed' by reports that the CIA was covertly surveying Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and 'allegedly developing plans to poison or even assassinate him on United Kingdom soil'.[PACE] reiterates its condemnation of all forms and practices of transnational repression"</nowiki>]—— In the chapter "Transnational repression" [[Radio France Internationale]]

Should these information to be added here? Someone insists to delete these with the reason [[WP:DUE]]. But I think these should be remained for 
:1. Assange is name prominent adherent; "Jacobin" and "RFI" are mainstream media; So it is qualified for WP:DUE.
:2. The removing of these information is against [[Wikipedia:YESPOV|"does not mean the exclusion of certain points of view; rather, it means including all verifiable points of view which have sufficient due weight."]], because none point of these information will be remained.

I want to write these as:

I propose the following text be added to WP:SUSPECT:
:''Given the legal presumption of innocence, criminal proceedings including those against prominent public persons, should not be mentioned on the [[Main_Page|main page]] of the encyclopdia until the cases are resolved either by conviction or acquittal. Any appellate proceedings shall have no bearing on whether or not to post the initial findings of a duly constituted court of law."
I have decided to post this as an RfC as this would involve a non-trivial amendment to [[WP:POLICY]] and the issue has become a contentious point of debate involving several nominations at [[WP:ITNC]]. -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 17:55, 26 November 2024 (UTC)}}
