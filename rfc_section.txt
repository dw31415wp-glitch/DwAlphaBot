These are tendentious propositions; you are pretending that your proposal is more neutral and closer to the official ideology, but you do not actually know what the terms "Socialist state" or "People\'s democratic state" actually mean. These terms concern the base-superstructural development of a given state and the ruling elites\' perceived understanding of the social development that has occurred under their rule. You can have a communist system and not have a socialist base, for example, according to these elites themselves. That is why North Korea was established as a people\'s democratic state. The North Korean state system is formally proclaimed in articles five to seven in the DPRK Constitution, and the party\'s role in Article 11.  The infobox should not portray the state\'s ideology, but its form of government. No parameter in the infobox says "State ideology". \n:We have only one article on Wikipedia discussing the form of government of these states: [[communist state]]. It needs to be linked there so our readers can get a generalised introduction to what a communist system actually is.

Why do you think China\'s form of government was officially the same from 1954 til now despite changing the moniker from people\'s democratic state to socialist state?

You wrote: "This is WP:OR, your personal interperetation of Marxist Theory is not a source. I\'m getting a little tired of your assertions."\n:::::You seem to completely misunderstand. The terms people’s democratic state and socialist state are not terms that describe the form of government, according to communists themselves. Again, North Korea does not define its form of government as socialist state, neither does any communist state. Yes, I wrote them using scholarly sources. I am guessing you are active on Wikipedia since you trust that Wikipedia can transmit truthful information.  Look at the sources used in those articles. Do those imply that people’s democracy is a term not used by scholars? Since all these articles are properly cited nothing is stopping you from a) checking out those sources and b) reading them.

They have their own unique form of Socialism, and the article should reflect such. You are doing original research by claiming "they have not changed" without PROVIDING any sources and then vaguely hiting at sources on articles YOU wrote, which may or may not even be ABOUT north korea.<sub style="color:#D33C3C; font-size:180%">⛿</sub> [[User:WeaponizingArchitecture|<span style="color:#111111">\'\'\'WeaponizingArchitecture\'\'\'</span>]] &#124; [[User talk:WeaponizingArchitecture|<span style="color:#111111">\'\'\'yell at me\'\'\'</span>]] 16:16, 27 December 2025 (UTC)\n:::::::Until 1972, North Korea claimed it was a people\'s democratic state and scholars acknowledged that. Good scholars also tried to analyse the term itself, and found out it meant rule by the WPK. Good liberal scholars understand that as dictatorship. \n:::::::That is also wrong. The WPK still teaches cadres in Marxism-Leninism. See [https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/10/north-koreas-marxist-revival.html] The North Korean media is full of direct references to Marxism-Leninism... Thomas Stock, a scholar, in his article, "North Korea’s Marxism-Leninism", argues that Juche is in the same tradition as M-L. Scholars Joe Pateman in his article, "Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and Marxism-Leninism", reaches the same conclusion. The [[Korean Central News Agency]] even publishes articles that state [https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/1565258143-198061077/what-is-the-ideological-and-mental-source-of-the-juche-idea-and-its-premise/ "The ideological and mental source of the Juche idea is the idea of “Aim High” and its premise is Marxism-Leninism."] In another article, the KCNA even states [https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/1451885000-638590309/ideological-and-spiritual-source-and-precondition-of-juche-idea/ "The Juche idea presupposes Marxism-Leninism ideologically and theoretically."]\n:::::::What you are saying is factually inaccurate on so many levels. [[User:TheUzbek|TheUzbek]] ([[User talk:TheUzbek|talk]]) 17:03, 27 December 2025 (UTC)\n::::::::Thank you for actually providing sources this time instead of vaguely pointing to your own articles on Wikipedia.\n::::::::Here\'s the quotation from your "Aim High" article:\n::::::::\'\'In this course, the great leader sympathized with a socialist ideology embodied in Marxism-Leninism, but he saw through its limitation of an age, its historical limitation. And through a profound analysis of it, he found new principles of revolution and built the frame of an independent revolutionary idea, the Juche idea. \'\'\n::::::::\'\'For this reason, the Juche idea is deeply connected with Marxism-Leninism that asserted to liquidate exploitation and oppression of man by man, eradicate all kinds of social inequality and build a socialist society where the broad working masses including working class enjoy a free and equal life. \'\'\n::::::::\'\'However, this never means that the Juche idea is an idea which inherited directly some principles of Marxism-Leninism. \'\'\n::::::::\'\'Though the Juche idea is an idea connected with Marxism-Leninism, \'\'\'it is a new, original revolutionary idea which gave answers to the demands of a historical age different from one of Marx and Lenin, and was evolved and systematized with its own peculiar principles.\'\'\'\'\'\n::::::::They say it is related but not the same ideology. The other KCNA article basically has the same text verbatim albeit shorter. \n::::::::Also, I believe the first article you cite falls under [[WP:TOOSOON]] considering this also happened about a year ago. But the article could state (and I believe this belongs on the page [[Workers Party of Korea]]) "Under the reign of Kim Jong Un, the Worker\'s Party of Korea, and by extension the government, have begun to revisit Marxism Leninism, etc. etc. Furthermore it could be useful to mention that Juche is derrived from Marxism Leninism, but from the currently established sources, it\'s considered a derived but separate ideology. I want to wait to see more information regarding the 2024 article, because if not much else changes, I think the impact on state ideology is minimal. There are sources saying the [[Cambodian People\'s Party]] still follows Marxist-Leninist party structure and governance, but it\'s ideology is completely divorced from leftism as a whole. <sub style="color:#D33C3C; font-size:180%">⛿</sub> [[User:WeaponizingArchitecture|<span style="color:#111111">\'\'\'WeaponizingArchitecture\'\'\'</span>]] &#124; [[User talk:WeaponizingArchitecture|<span style="color:#111111">\'\'\'yell at me\'\'\'</span>]] 17:32, 27 December 2025 (UTC)\n:::::::::Cambodian People\'s Party is still run as a tightly knit Marxist-Leninist party, but it is not Marxist-Leninist.\n:::::::::As for your point.

[[User:TheUzbek|TheUzbek]] ([[User talk:TheUzbek|talk]]) 08:54, 26 December 2025 (UTC)\n:\'\'\'Bad Rfc\'\'\' we already had consensus over the fact that DPRK is a communist state, ruled by a communist party with a goal of achieving communism. Wikipedia does not follow the DPRK constitution, and I think you don\'t really understand what a "communist state" is. A "communist state", theoretically, is achieved through stages: people\'s democratic state → socialist state → communism, and countries either identify themselves in these categories, yet, they still remain committed to communism. A communist state does not mean a state \'\'which is\'\' "communist" (moreover an ultimate communist system would not allow "states" to exist), it means that the state\'s \'\'ultimate goal\'\' is communism, and the state committed to attain this have to climb through people\'s democratic and socialist conditions. For example, [[Czechoslovak People\'s Republic]] declared their elevation from people\'s democracy to socialism and changed their name to [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia]] in 1960, still they were committed to bring communism thus was a "communist state". Such states never self-identify as "communist", but describe themselves "socialist" or "people\'s democratic"; if self-identification would\'ve been the sole criteria, then USSR, China, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos none have been described as "communist", but which \'\'are\'\' classified in reality. The problem is DPRK rulers has removed Marxism–Leninism from their constitution, a rare move among the communist party-ruled countries that creates confusion sometimes. Despite this, DPRK\'s political evolution since 1948 nonetheless shows that it\'s still a "communist state", in whatever description they use. Hope you have understand, Merry Christmas!
