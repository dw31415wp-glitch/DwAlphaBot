_40 signatures in '''1 week'''. These two numbers should be related (more time = more sigs), so I can't say this is the ideal pair. I don't care exactly how many signatures we land on, just that the number should be slightly higher than it currently is due to 1. the size of the enwiki community, about 10x that of dewiki, and 2. the way the community approaches these petitions thus far. I ''do'' feel very strongly that petitions should be much shorter, ideally a week, at most two. As they are, they do not serve as a running tally of disparate incidents (as they do on dewiki), instead focusing mainly on a single trigger incident, so the current time frame is too long.

_:Looks like the original close of the recall check-in RfC has been overturned. As my !vote was premised on that close, it bears clarifying. Shortening the timeframe could greatly improve the discourse at recall petitions. It would limit the superfluous objections to the petition or process itself in the discussion section and produce a faster result for the subject, and save vast sums of community time. This clarity is sorely needed. (An alternative solution would be to abolish discussion entirely, which I would also support.) Requiring more signatures, the change with the most supports in the check-in, wouldn't solve any of these problems.

_'''25 signatures over 30 days'''. Per [[Wikipedia:Administrator recall/Lists#Closed]], of the 9 successful petitions, the petition length by days was: 10, 11, 1, 0, 0, 0, 20, 0, 1, for an average of 4.8 days. 14 day petitions would have resulted in one successful petition becoming unsuccessful (Night Gyr), reduction to 7 days would have resulted in a further two unsuccessful (Graham87, Fastily). Some predictive modelling could interpret signature quantity increase (based on exponential/momentum of signing) to estimate how it would effect successful petitions. My guestimate is that on it's own it might not effect much with a 30 day petition, but alongside a reduction to 14 days would probably also reverse the result of two 10/11 day petitions at minimum (if sig increase >30-40% to >33-35). I'm left thinking the proposal is trying to break something that's working as intended, or fix something without knowing how it's broken, given there are no signs of damage.

_:On the note of successful petitions, I'd highlight that when the cases are not clear cut, the community has successfully self moderated. For [[Wikipedia:Administrator_recall/Necrothesp|Necrothesp]], the petition was quickly withdrawn, while there were several ambiguous cases that did not proceed to recall, like [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive376#Peter_Southwood_and_close_paraphrasing,_again|Pbsouthwood]].

_<s>There's apparently/allegedly consensus to increase the number of signatures and shorten the threshold, which is a ... surprising outcome of that RfC, so I'd go with 30 signatures over 28 days.</s> The alternative to recall is Arbcom, and if someone asked Arbcom to take a sysop abuse case, then 30 good faith Wikipedians co-signing the petition virtually guarantees that Arbcom would take the case. My position remains that 30 good faith Wikipedians is an ''extraordinarily'' high threshold just to begin the process of discussing someone's suitability for adminship. The 28 days is to allow time for people to discuss, interrogate, and challenge the claims the petitioners are making. I advocate that it should be '''mandatory''' for the petition to remain open for a minimum period, so that petitioners have sufficient time to withdraw their !votes after reflecting on the discussion. The fashion for closing recall petitions as soon as they hit the minimum threshold is helpfully meant -- it's intended to minimise the pain for the target admin -- but it should not continue. For the reasons I've given I '''strongly oppose''' any increase above 30 signatures and any drastic shortening of the recall period below 28 days.—[[User:S Marshall|<b style="font-family: Verdana; color: Maroon;">S&nbsp;Marshall</b>]]&nbsp;<small>[[User talk:S Marshall|T]]/[[Special:Contributions/S Marshall|C]]</small> 10:39, 30 December 2025 (UTC)

  _'''Light hand on signatures, significant cut to time frame''' - 25 signatures is already sufficient to identify that there is a problem here. however, a bad petition sitting in limbo for a full month is not ideal. if I had to throw a dart, I'd throw it at 30 signatures/14 days, but there's flexibility in both numbers there.

  _'''25 signatures, 30 days''' Recalls shouldn't only be for slam dunk cases. If it takes 30 days to start a discussion, it takes 30 days.

- '''Q1: 25 signatures; Q2: 21 days''': Broadly this process appears to be working ok in capturing and actioning concerns. Shortening the time that someone finds themselves under the process seems fair. (That said, whatever the time limit, anyone reaching that point one or two sigs short of recall would surely feel themselves placed in an awkward position regarding confidence in ongoing admin activity.)

  _'''25 signatures, 30 days'''. As others have said, the process is working and each successful recall attempt was warranted. The experience to date has shown it does take some time for the ball to get rolling, so shortening it or raising the signature count significantly could neuter the process.

  _'''25 signatures over 30 days''' Recall is working as intended. The close for the check-in was deeply flawed, as every vote for "Option A" should've counted as a vote against all the other options, meaning that the net support for every proposed change should've been negative, and any discussion where 50% says "keep the status quo" should've been closed as "No consensus for change". I'm afraid that this RfC is as flawed as the last one, as we have two open-ended options with infinite possibilities, which leads to an impossible bartender close process. It should be two separate !votes with a finite number of options each. <span class="nowrap">--[[User:Ahecht|Ahecht]] ([[User talk:Ahecht|<b style="color:#FFF;background:#04A;display:inline-block;padding:1px;vertical-align:middle;font:bold 50%/1 sans-serif;text-align:center">TALK<br />PAGE</b>]])</span> 16:30, 30 December 2025 (UTC)

  _'''50 signatures over 2 weeks''': To say "it's working" discounts a lot of factors.

  _::Well... because maybe ''sometimes'' editors are honestly confused, or acting on impulse, or not quite understanding the situation, or possibly even just following the crowd?
  _::[[m:Community Wishlist Survey 2019/Editing/Keep the lightweight text editor]] was a petition some years ago for a technical change. It got more than 50 support votes in just five days, and it was preceded by a separate discussion that got more than 50 votes in just three days. Obviously, it's very important and the community is unified, right?
  _::However, the petition was to:
  _::# Turn on [[:File:Edit toolbar - 2.png|some blue-gray buttons]]
  _::# Next year.  
  _::and what most the voters wanted was:
  _::# To fix [[:File:CharInsert-it.PNG|a different menu]]
  _::# Right now.

  _'''25 signatures, 30 days''' - All the evidence we have points towards this working as intended. Especially with two trying to get the bit back and roundly rejected by the community. Also looking at the recent check in, it seems clear the votes were not really counted in the best way. The clear majority said no change/status quo, but they were not counted as oppose change, and as such reached in my opinion an incorrect conclusion. Judging by the discussions on the closer page I was not alone.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dr_vulpes#About_the_RECALL_Close] [[User:PackMecEng|PackMecEng]] ([[User talk:PackMecEng|talk]]) 17:25, 30 December 2025 (UTC)
  _With all due respect I think this RfC was premature. It is very difficult to find a workable process consensus from an open-ended RfC. The recall checkin I see as an attempt to gather all possible views, and so needed to be open-ended. Any followups should have been subject to extensive workshopping. I imagine it's a little late to call a halt to this, so I will note that I support any '''increase in the number of signatures''', with a tentative preference for 50. We modelled this process off of the de.wiki process, but our community is far larger. As long as the suffrage requirement is not in any way limited beyond XC, I am willing to bet that any active admin will accumulate 25 signatures at a recall petition. That said, I'm increasingly less convinced that a petition is the correct first step for a recall. The intent behind the process was for bit retention to be determined via RRFA, with a petition process intended to filter out frivolous requests. Raising the signature threshold may help address the discomfort some admins have with recall being used to enforce activity standards higher than mandated at [[WP:INACTIVITY]], but it will increase the risk of desysopping-by-petition. I would like to see us more toward a process with a higher evidentiary requirement but a lower numerical requirement. I also strongly oppose any moratorium on discussion. This is a new process. I support its continued existence but there are kinks to be ironed out. [[User:Vanamonde93|Vanamonde93]] ([[User talk:Vanamonde93|talk]]) 17:55, 30 December 2025 (UTC)
  _'''40 signatures, one week''' One week is historically been the RfA period, it makes sense to use it. And I'm with those who feel there should be a meaningful bar.

  _:It's like a political recall. You don't have to get a majority of the voters on board, just enough to bring it to the rest of the voters - and 50 votes would be a very large percentage of most RFAs.

- '''25 signatures over 30 days'''. One of the complaints about the process I've seen is that the petition does not seem to lead to RRFAs. This change would exacerbate that purported issue.

  _'''40 or 50 signatures over 7 days'''. First, I want to say that I think the way this discussion has been constructed is unlikely to yield a valid outcome, because it has gone straight to being a poll, in which editors are stating their preferred numbers and potentially digging in, while bypassing a workshop where the ideas could be thoughtfully examined first. Right now (admittedly it is early) the discussion looks headed towards contradicting the consensus of the previous discussion that was closed merely a few days ago. My suggestion, close this as yielding two results: that a significant number of editors want to retain the ''status quo'' without changing anything, and some sort of consensus alternative to the ''status quo'' – then, have a follow-up RfC, which asks editors to choose between the ''status quo'' and the proposed alternative.{{pb
  }}Anyway, I think we should seek a result that is neither "quick and efficient" nor "slow and burdensome", in favor of something that is ''reasonable''. In the previous discussion, there was a consensus that having a recall that ''fails'' to reach success can be unfair to the administrator, because if the outcome is that they have not done anything worthy of recall, why should the petition be left hanging there for 30 days? That is unreasonable, and the intention of making it easy to, eventually, accumulate enough signatures is not a valid reason to do it that way. Traditional RfA is for 7 days. AELECT is for 7 days. And our experience with recall, so far, indicates that it is ''very'' unlikely to need more than 7 days to obtain enough signatures for a petition that will be successful. It should be 7 days.{{pb
  }}I'm not sure whether it should be 40 or 50 signatures, and I'm OK with either number. Here's what we know from our experience so far: we typically get 25 signatures for a successful petition in about one day. Making a simple-minded extrapolation leads to expecting 50 signatures in two days. However, it's reasonable to expect that there will be some trailing off, after the initial rush, so it might take more than two days. But it won't be difficult or burdensome to get that many in 7 days. Having a threshold that gets met in about one day may serve a desire to be "quick and efficient", but it is unreasonable. Petitions often open and close in the time between when many editors log out, and when they log in the next day. That's not getting a balanced input from the community. And there's no valid need to do it that fast. We need to have confidence that the result of a recall is reached in a thoughtful manner, with representative input from across the community. And we can be confident that 40 or 50 signatures in 7 days is realistic for successful petitions, based on our experience so far. --[[User:Tryptofish|Tryptofish]] ([[User talk:Tryptofish|talk]]) 23:36, 30 December 2025 (UTC)

  _:::::I see, that's to bad. Because it is always interesting to look at the consequences of changes.

I do not quite see how comparing it to a completely different process, RFA, is useful in this situation. It is a completely different process with the ONLY similarity being it has to do with the admin bit. So perhaps you could expand on why you think that is an appropriate comparison?

And (4) If you don't have the community's confidence, your tools should be removed.}} That is indeed the purpose of a recall process and the outcome that should result that should arise from losing the community's confidence. The problem is that the recall process we have doesn't evaluate the community's confidence in an admin: it identifies only whether any 25 extended-confirmed editors have lost confidence in you, ''or'' think your adminship should be reconfirmed ''or'' dislike you (for any reason) ''or'' like adding their names to things ''or'' dislike the concept of administrators ''or'' think you haven't been active enough for their personal taste ''or'' for no reason at all. This is regardless of what anybody who isn't one of those 25 people think - even someone who unquestionably has the confidence of the community could find 25 people within 30 days supporting a petition against them.

  _:As explained, by myself and others, it is not possible to say ''objectively'' whether there has or has not been a miscarriage because the "right" outcome for each petition is subjective. Per Tryptofish elsewhere in this discussion, whether there has or has not already been a miscarriage is also the wrong question. The correct question is whether the current setup allows for miscarriages to happen, and as I and others have repeatedly explained the answer to that question is unquestionably "yes", for multiple different reasons.

  _::''All'' decision-making processes, from Wikipedia to the scientific method, from corporate management to courts of law, allow miscarriages to happen. AfD sometimes makes the wrong decision, so we have DRV. RFC sometimes makes the wrong decision, so we have RFC close reviews. Blocking decisions aren't exactly infallible either; a huge proportion of long term, good faith editors have a stupid block in their block log that can't be erased. (An indef block harms someone ''far'' more than a desysopping does, and we apply indefs randomly and on whim.) RFA sometimes makes the wrong decision, so we have recall. And as you rightly say, recall will, eventually, make the wrong decision. At that point we'll do the usual and have a huge sprawling discussion in a central place that goes on for too long and generates far too much text, but eventually, after everyone's been heard, produces a fudge of some sort.

  _::::::{{orange|"who regard recall as something-that-must-not-ever-be-modified"}} That is not true, for me at least. I'm not opposed to scrapping the entire petition process in favor of a "performance review" system where admins would be required to file for a RRfA/Request to Retain Adminship every, let's say, 24 months, if they wish to retain their administrator privileges. (This would for sure help with admin [[WP:INACTIVITY]], as admins who are inactive would most likely not file RRfAs.) I'm sure that this is a ''very'' unpopular idea, and that admins probably prefer petitions over performance reviews (which is completely understandable; again, I'm not opposed to the current petition process and think it's working fine as is).

  _:::::::Even ignoring the issues of capacity for that many re-RFAs, the most recent voluntary reconfirmation RFAs received oppose votes on the grounds that they were wasting the community's time. That is not fair on the administrator concerned and above all else a process for de/readminship ''must'' be fair to all parties (this is my overriding goal in all my comments on these discussions, the current system is not fair to subject administrators).

  _::::Golly gee whiz, I guess I should be happy that my comment has attracted enough replies to be visible from outer space. Must have touched some nerves. So I'm going to repeat what I've already said, that this RfC has become unproductive, with editors (not all of them, but too many) taking entrenched positions and just arguing with each other with little possibility of agreement in sight. We are going to end up with a plurality that will be misrepresented as a consensus. I think it has become a waste of time to try to improve the recall system in hopes of preventing a future bad outcome. That's because a lot of editors (not all of them, but too many) are entrenched in the illogical (and frankly, idiotic) position that, because we have had a number of recall petitions so far, and none of them has resulted in a generally-accepted case of a bad result, it is therefore unlikely that a bad result could ever happen in the future, and so any proposal to make a change that might ward off a ''potential'' bad result in the future is just dealing with an unproven hypothetical, and consequently is going to break a system that is already near-to perfect. (I'm reminded of [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]'s quote about the folly of throwing away one's umbrella because, so far, one hasn't gotten wet.) Maybe in the future, we just won't have any malfunctioning recalls, and it will be OK. Or maybe, we will eventually have a recall that reaches 25 in a month, but there will be a consensus that it was a miscarriage of justice (and maybe the admin will pass a reconfirmation RfA, or maybe the admin will just leave Wikipedia). When (and if) ''that'' happens, it will (sadly) be a different environment for having discussions about improving recall. That's unfortunate, but the reality is that those of us who think we can see a trainwreck coming will have to wait until it gets here, before we will be able to have an intelligent conversation about how to prevent it from happening again.

I would also like the time frame to be long enough that people move past their initial anger, but not so long that there's an axe hanging over the person's head for an entire month. ~ ''[[User:ONUnicorn|<span style="color:#0cc">ONUnicorn</span>]]''<sup>([[User talk:ONUnicorn|Talk]]&#124;[[Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn|Contribs]])</sup><small>[[WP:P&amp;S|problem solving]]</small> 20:50, 31 December 2025 (UTC)

It does not work (and apparently is not meant to work) as a consensus process, yet it seeks to overturn and in reality will regularly overturn consensus. So, one of the remedies for such a ham-handed and ill-fitting vote process is to increase the sample size of the electorate (it ''is'' a vote process) to more likely reflect a community consensus. (I'll support any of the natural numbers above that increase the support numbers.) More votes required will also mean more due process.

Existing requirements are on the low end of the [[Goldilocks principle|Goldilocks zone]].

Also, to those who want much stricter requirements: admin bits are privileges not rights, and they basically were rights if you weren't caught in misconduct before.

_'''Doesn't need 30 days''' - I think we've seen that there are warts with the current process, but just to address time, 30 days for RFCs was to allow time for editors who might have an opposing (or different) view to find the discussion and contribute. In the case of recall, it is neither a discussion, nor does it allow for contrary views to be considered in its closure. Indeed, [[WP:CON|consensus]] is nowhere to be found in this petition process. As such a week or 2 should be plenty. If [[WP:RFA|RFA]] can achieve an outcome in 7 days, surely a recall petition can. --- As for the question of signatures, it's probably immaterial due to the lack of concensus process in the petition model. That said, 25 seems awfully low considering the the petition appears have seemingly become a fait accompli on its own. 100 in 7 days seems the top threshhold ([[WP:100|we have a special page for that]]).

I think that 25 signatures to actually gain support for a petition to succeed seems like a small number and 30 days is more than enough time for discussions. Hence, I also think the number of signatures to have a petition succeed should be increased and the expiry time of each petition should be shortened. ~[[User:SG5536B|<span style="color:#027704">SG</span>]][[User talk:SG5536B|<span style="color:#00509f">5536</span>]]B 09:03, 23 January 2026 (UTC)

- '''25/7 or more days'''. I think 25 signatures is not a bad threshhold. If 25 people told me I should rRfA, I'd do it tomorrow. (And frankly if they were 25 people I generally considered competent, experienced and well-intentioned, I'd just down tools.)
  :I do think 30 days is a very long time; if the snowball hasn't started rolling in a week, I'm not sure it's going to, but I don't actually have a strong opinion on that part of the question. I'm not concerned that some 30-day petitions took longer than a week to get full support; people will procrastinate when they know they have 30 days to decide whether to sign, whether their support is needed or they can stay above the fray, whatever.

  _'''30-40 in 7''', broadly per Tryptofish. For such a serious process as a recall, just 25 required supports feels oddly low, and petitioners being given a month to get those 25 support votes together opens up the possibility of a frivolous petition resulting in a frivolous RfA that wastes the community’s tim (even if that hasn’t happened yet).

  _'''25/30''', system works just fine, none of the (correctly certified) recalls have been shown to be in error. NOTBROKEN. [[User:Fram|Fram]] ([[User talk:Fram|talk]]) 10:47, 26 January 2026 (UTC)
  \*''''''25 signatures in 30 days'''''' I think it allows time for less active Wikipedians to also contribute their opinions. If it stays open for a month, and doesn't get any support then there are no consequences: nothing major is lost. I don't think it wastes the community's time.
