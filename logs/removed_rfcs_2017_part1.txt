There is a dispute over content in the lede of this article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sharon_Tate&type=revision&diff=756492680&oldid=756491938 diff here]). The concern was in regard to the suitability of the content per [[WP:LEDE]]. The content was removed but later reinstated (with citations); the reinstating editor states the content has existed for an extended period of time. The discussion ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sharon_Tate&oldid=756539136#Top_Billing diff here]) has not been productive and could benefit from more opinions. 

The specific question is: '''Should this content be added to the lede?'''. Please respond in the following manner:

*'''Support''', keep in lede
*'''Oppose''', remove from lede
*'''Other''': any other solution including rephrasing

When you respond, please use the "Survey" section below and the "Discussion" section for any threaded discussions.

{{rfcquote|text=
I propose we adopt an activity requirement for approved bots on the English Wikipedia.  Rare bots are expected to be read-only, but some have only on-demand tasks.  As such, tying in operator activity may be accounted for.  The proposed policy addition is:
* <big>Bot accounts that have had no logged actions or edits for two years, where the listed operator has also had no logged actions or edits for two years, will be deauthorized.  Following a one week notification period on the [[Wikipedia:bot owners' noticeboard|bot owners' noticeboard]], and the operator's talk page, prior task approvals will be considered expired and bot flags will be removed.  Should the operator return and wish to reactivate the bot, a new [[Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval|request for approval]] must be completed.</big>

This puts the policy more in line with the practice of retiring dormant bot accounts.  Unsupervised bot accounts present a moderate security risk, should they be compromised high speed editing or slow-speed but less visible editing could take place.  Additionally, community policies and practices evolve over time and formerly approved bot tasks may no longer be appropriate.  See recent BOWN discussions:
:[[Wikipedia:Bot_owners'_noticeboard#Inactive_bots_with_inactive_editors_to_mark_as_retired]]
:[[Wikipedia:Bot_owners'_noticeboard#Inactive_bots_over_5_years]]

On 23 July, 2015, large chunks of this article were deleted. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jawaharlal_Nehru&diff=672709346&oldid=672626463 diff1] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jawaharlal_Nehru&diff=672711045&oldid=672710205 diff2]. The deleted content included the following sections:
*On Caste system, and Caste based reservations (chunks of this section deleted)
*Religion (chunks of this section deleted)
*Budhism
*On Cow Protection
*On Spiritualism in India
*Secular State
*Views on communalism
*Nehru and Science
*Nehru as a person
*Nehru and Patel
*On Communism, Fascism, and Hindu Right-wing Communalism in India

Other changes were made to reduce the neutrality of the article. For instance, the words "According to a ''Times of India'' editorial, Nehru  left behind a disputed legacy, being "either adored or reviled for India's progress or lack of it." were changed to "Nehru, thus, left behind a disputed legacy, being "either adored or reviled for India's progress or lack of it." These words have exactly one source to back them up which is a Times of India editorial. So the previous version was clearly better and not the changed version (which exists till date).

Also, what makes the large scale deletions (refer to diffs given above) curious is that the person who carried them out (refer to diffs given above) has been [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&page=User%3AD4iNa4 blocked for socking in the past] and is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:D4iNa4&diff=754972625&oldid=751264060 again being accused of socking]. I am pinging this editor so that he is aware of the outcome of the RfC: {{u|D4iNa4}}

This RfC is being initiated to determine whether the removed content should be re-inserted into the main article. Please vote '''Support''' to accept my proposal to re-insert the deleted material or '''Oppose''' to maintain the status quo.[[User:Soham321|Soham321]] ([[User talk:Soham321|talk]]) 04:11, 29 December 2016 (UTC)}}

We seem to have an ongoing issue with certain types of names being reported at [[WP:UAA]]. They generally fall into one of the following categories:

:*Some random non-notable persons name paired with "official" or "productions" 
:*Some non-notable YouTube channel or blog name

These are reported as being promotional usernames, both by the bot and by users. They are usually tagged as promotional usernames. The current wording of [[WP:CORPNAME]] does not appear to support blocking these names as they represent individuals, not organizations. Yes, they are usually engaging in editing that is not desirable, such as creating social media style "profile" user pages or trying to write an article on their personal  YouTube channel. But is it the ''editing'' or the ''username'' that administrators should be concerned with? Can we, as a matter of policy,  block these names? If we can, should we? If we cannot or should not should we actively discourage users from reporting these names? 21:57, 4 December 2016 (UTC)}}

*I think that the categories should be included, as the term "assassin" has been used by a number of sources. If the consensus is to use "murderer" in the article text, that's fine, but an assassination is a specific form of murder and these categories are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, I would tend to agree that the "assassination" categories should be reinstated in the article.

::However, an entire section on the use of the term "assassination" seems unwarranted; unless a discussion about this term in particular relating to Mair appears in reliable sources, this should be avoided.

The table in the section "Victims" has been wrong since it was added. The numbers don't add up mathematically, and some of the sources used contradict each other. This is no surprise since there is no official tally yet. It has been deleted until we get the data, but of course it was restored although it is obviously wrong. At some point someone even changed the (sourced) numbers in the lead to match the table.
My suggestion is that we replace it with a short summary (in prose) of the confirmed numbers, even if those are not yet complete, and wait with a full tally until the data is available.

Since we have had deflategate information in the lead bouncing in and out over the months, let's discuss it here. There was a statement added and reverted, <i>Brady was suspended for the first four games of the 2016 season for his alleged part in the football tampering scandal known as [[Deflategate]].</i>

I'd contend that a statement to that effect belongs in the lede. There is a detailed section under the 2015 season on the subject, and it is a hotly debated topic to this day. That argues it should receive a mention in the lede, particularly as it <i>will</i> get brought up when he's considered for the Hall of Fame. The suspension itself (4 games) is largely meaningless, but the bitter legal battle between one of the marquee names in the sport and the Commissioner going almost to the Supreme Court, deserves mention in the lead. I would suggest a statement more like:

<i>Brady was alleged to have participated in the football tampering scandal known as [[Deflategate]]. The back-and-forth conflict between Brady and Goodell escalated through the courts being reversed multiple times, at one point looking like it was going to be appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. After more than a year of court battles, Brady served a 4-game suspension at the beginning of the 2016 season, ending the legal battles.</i>

The stance of the Greek state in the [[Macedonian dispute]](among the most controversial issues in Europe) has already made its way as a definition of the leads of Wikipedia articles such as [[Ancient Macedonians]]. So, let's ask who has written it? In the edit history - it seems the Greek users. So, I think more users should define this in a RfC. The suggestion is the following - all the "essentially Greek" definitions to be removed from the leads of Ancient Macedonia-related articles and to be replaced with a neutral and balanced statements that would give weight to other authors and will not declare any theory as a fact - but only as a theory. I '''support''' the second proposal. At least anything more neutral than the current situation that may be proposed by the closing administrator would be more acceptable.

If you're reviewing a GA nominee article and you put it on hold because it has minor issues, what's the point of waiting the prescribed time if you find all of the issues are fixed before that time is up? I'd like to change the policies concerning good article reviews so that if an on-hold nominee article has all of its issues fixed before the on-hold time is up, a reviewer can promote the article right away.

This article was recently created by me, and shortly thereafter [[User:Bearcat]] disputed the neutrality of this article. Without discussion, an anonymous editor using [http://www.gogoair.com/ airplane Wi-Fi] proceeded to remove a lot of referenced information which he [[WP:IDONTLIKEIT|must not have liked]]. A neutral tone is important, and making the language a little less harsh is understandable, but removing referenced information is [[whitewashing]] and a general disservice to readers of Wikipedia. The overwhelming majority of sources criticize the website. [http://www.snopes.com/fox-news-benghazi-probe-hoax/ Snopes has debunked articles published by Bipartisan Report]. This website is documented in reliable sources as essentially being something ran out of someone's basement, using far-fetched headlines as [[click bait]], and the operator of the website doesn't even contest that. In my opinion, this article is not even worth keeping with only three sentences. The article, as it stands now, barely demonstrates [[WP:N|notability]], and it's debatable if it demonstrates it at all since this website is proof that anyone with an internet connected device can make a site "claiming" to be the world's largest newspaper, just as any 13 year old girl can claim to be the world's best soccer player on her Facebook page. I do believe, however, that the article met the requirements of inclusion prior to the reduction in content, as there were numerous [[WP:RS|sources]] cited. I propose reinstating the deleted material, but perhaps in a softer fashion.

So the previous discussion mainly evolved around whether it was appropriate to use the "officeholder" infobox template to list Trump's chairmanship at the Trump Organization as an office.  Since [[user:Edge3|Edge3]] switched it into the current non-officeholder template however, I feel that there is now applicable to add the Trump Organization on the infobox as I have shown here. This edit, however, was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_Trump&diff=758295421&oldid=758281277 removed] by [[user:RedBear2040|RedBear2040]] citing "no consensus". So is it possible to get an agreement going here to implement it for good? I also am aware of the ongoing RfC on this topic, but that was in the context of the "officeholder" template that was still being used, so it has become a little irrelevant to me.

Okay its time to settle this discussion we have not had an RFC to settle this question and I ask all editors to look at the guidelines for [[Wikipedia:Nationality of people from the United Kingdom|WP:Nationality of people from the United Kingdom]] and in relation to this RFC the sub section within that dealing with sport [[Wikipedia:Nationality_of_people_from_the_United_Kingdom#Guide_to_finding_UK_nationality|Guide to finding UK nationality/Sport]] you also need to read [[WP:Neutral_point_of_view#Due_and_undue_weight|WP:NPOV-Due and undue weight]] in determining your comments.

Currently we have a number of Editors in two camps those who feel that according to UK Nationality Guide section on Sport then we should be stating British tennis player first and references to his [[National identity]] second

For other Editors its the opposite way round preferring Scottish tennis player first references to British second. You will note in some of the examples that I have provided in relation to notable tennis players from the UK the leads are mixed if we are to follow the sports sub section guidelines in relation to this particular sport we need to ask are those being followed? Not just for this article but also the others. 

I would also ask that you look at the articles on [[Nationality]], [[Nation]], and [[National identity]] as they are quite different things and do your own research.

'''Options do we'''

'''Keep the lead as is''' (Andy Murray is a Scottish professional tennis player currently ranked world No. 1 in men's singles. Murray represents Great Britain...)  '''to avoid edit warring'''.

'''Change the lead to read per the guidelines interpretation to read.'''

# Andy Murray is a British tennis player from Scotland
# Andy Murray is a British tennis player born in Scotland
# Andy Murray is a Scottish born British tennis player

Editors are free to add other suggestions at any point my preference would be option one that is in line with the quotation example from Andy Murray and keeping in line with the national and international sport associations view that I provided please lets keep this discussion as civil as possible and be as balanced as you can.--[[User:Navops47|Navops47]] ([[User talk:Navops47|talk]]) 07:38, 14 December 2016 (UTC)}}

According to [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Common outcomes#Schools]], commonly referred to by its abbreviated link [[WP:SCHOOLOUTCOMES]], "Most independently accredited degree-awarding institutions and high schools are usually kept ''except'' when zero [[Wikipedia:Independent sources|independent sources]] can be found to prove that the institution [[WP:HOAX|actually exists]]". However, a number of recent AfDs on secondary schools have closed either with no consensus or with consensus to delete. The closing summaries of two of these AfDs, [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eden English School Btl]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bal Vikash Secondary School]], have included recommendations that an RfC be held on the notability of secondary schools. Following discussion of this at [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Common outcomes#Need for an RfC on schools' notability]], there is agreement to hold this RfC, with the following question:

Given that there is limited space in the lead to fully summarize an article, and also given that the lead, in the state it was in until I tried to make it better, featured almost 50% of the text solely about New York City and ignored most of the state, I pared down some of the more esoteric New York City information and added, to replace it, more information about New York State as a whole which was missing from the article.  It was called "vandalism" and reverted.  Which is, itself, an interesting definition of "vandalism" but I'd rather not get into that here.  Please consider, for the purpose of this RFC the narrow question of a) does the lead represented by [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_York&oldid=754801283 This version], which focuses mostly on New York City, or the lead represented by [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_York&direction=next&oldid=754801283 this version] which has roughly the same amount of text but changes the focus to New York State present a better version of the article.  I'm not even particularly attached to the exact wording here, just on the general question of should we or should we not alter the lead to focus on New York State more than New York City specifically.

Hey gang ([[User:Binksternet]], [[User:Greg Fasolino]], [[User:Ilovetopaint]], [[User:Drmies|Drmies]], [[User:Myxomatosis57]], [[User:OpenFuture]],), wondering if we can get some friendly moderation on this article, which has unfortunately degenerated into [[User:Dan56]]'s pet project over the last year or so. I've attempted to make positive contributions in the past, ranging from rephrasing sentences to adding subsections to altering quote choices, all which were all summarily reverted by Dan56 without convincing explanations beyond "I like my way better." IMO the lead is clumsily organized (release date in last paragraph? unconnected background info in the first paragraph? No context specific to the album i.e. how and where it was recorded until the second paragraph?), the writing in terms of style strikes me as is often tacky and indulgent in places (how many in-depth explanations from the artist's mouth do we need? some summarizing and restraint would be welcome in that department), some iffy quote interpolations, etc. Several other users ([[User:My name is not dave|My name is not dave]], [[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]]) have criticized Dan56 on the talk page for similar issues, as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Maxinquaye#Encyclopedic_style_and_neutral_point_of_view.3F you] can [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Maxinquaye#Recent_revision_to_the_lead see], but he's simply dismissed them and held up the article's Good Article status as sufficient validation of his efforts—user my name is not dave nonetheless only approved the article with the following caveat: "It seems to be a matter of taste when it comes to the lead, I think we've gone past the stage of convincing each other, so better hold it there."

This RfC is an extension of the [[Talk:Death of JonBenét Ramsey#I have removed "Murder" references]] discussion on the talk page, which is an extension of a recent move discussion. '''One view''' is that use of the word ''murder'' within the article is against the [[WP:NPOV]] policy since "the result of the Request to Move was that this article should be called 'Death of..' not 'Murder of...' because the theory that JonBenét was murdered, while plausible, is not the only plausible theory accepted by reliable sources. There is a substantial body of respectable thought that she was the victim of an accidental killing." Because of this view, it is argued that we also cannot use murder categories in the article. '''The other view''' is that the rationale for moving the article is flawed because the WP:NPOV policy, especially its [[WP:Due weight]] section, is about giving most of our weight to what the majority of reliable sources state. The vast majority of reliable sources call JonBenét Ramsey's death a murder. Therefore, stating that she was murdered and/or using "murder" categories is not a violation of the WP:NPOV policy. Furthermore, as has been noted before, [[murder]] is not always intentional. 

I will alert related WikiProjects to this RfC, editors at [[Wikipedia talk:Neutral point of view]], [[Wikipedia talk:Article titles]] and [[Wikipedia talk:Verifiability]], and editors at <Strike>[[WP:Village pump (policy)]]</Strike> [[WP:Village pump (miscellaneous)]] (Village pump (policy) is not for dispute issues.)

There have been ongoing discussions about the use of "death" or "murder" in the [[Death of JonBenét Ramsey]] article. One perspective is that it is routinely, or nearly always, called a murder in the press - and was a murder. Another is that there has not been a conviction, and so use of the word "murder" is presumptuous. This also relates to whether the [[Death_of_JonBenét_Ramsey#Family_member_theory|family member theory]] section is appropriate for the article. (i.e., the question of murder vs. homicide isn't just related to a family member scenario), but there are some that believe that section is not appropriate for the article. So, the questions are: Is "murder" an appropriate word to use in the article? 2) Is the family member theory section inappropriate for the article?

As most editors think tourist attractions are organisations (They are not as far as I can tell. They are places; I checked the categories), unless there's something I'm missing (I didn't see anything in [[:Category:Organizations]] that could have anything to do with tourist attractions), I'm proposing an extension of A7 to explicitly cover tourist attractions and similar places. This will certainly make life easier for everyone, especially editors like myself who go by the categories in determining what a subject is. If I am missing something, then I think an addition to the wording of the templates is necessary to make it clearer.

{{rfcquote|text=
Radha Madhav Dham is a Hindu temple in Hays County Texas. Should it be mentioned that in 2013 at least one invocation (prayer) was given by Diwakari Devi, the leader of this temple, to the Hays County Commissioners Court?
This information is supported by the court's own [http://hays.granicus.com/DocumentViewer.php?file=hays_9b090e4b-6e90-46ca-bdf3-5ef7d6dc4a12.pdf routine minutes] (and the court's [http://hays.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=56 video of the meeting], which includes the invocation), and two additional sources:
* Hankins, L.W. 2013. [http://smmercury.com/2013/10/23/freethought-san-marcos-part-2-how-hays-county-government-promotes-religion/ ''How Hays County government promotes religion''] - This is an opinion by a lawyer in the ''[[San Marcos Mercury]]'' a local paper or website. The article mainly deals with 1st Amendment issues and mentions the temple briefly, but not by name. This opinion appears to have been [http://www.texasfreethoughtjournal.net/article/how-hays-county-government-promotes-religion-part-2 republished] from The Texas Freethought Journal, which appears to be name the lawyer uses for his own blog.
*''Diwakari Devi of Radha Madhav Dham gives Invocation at Hays County Court''. [http://archive.li/FElsF#selection-167.0-167.72 archived link] from ''[[The Vrindavan Times]]'' which now appears defunct but was a paper or website serving [[Vrindavan]], the town in India which is the location of the temple's organization, [[Jagadguru Kripalu Parishat|JKP]]. I cannot find enough information on this source to confidently assess its reliability, but it appears to be affiliated with the JKP.

The argument above has been exceedingly long, but 
*Points for inclusion are:
:That it helps establish that the temple is still active after changing its name in 2012 following an unrelated controversy
:Without this, there would be nothing listed in the history section following 2012 
:That it's of interest as part of the temple's history, and that a Hindu invocation in a Texas court is itself noteworthy
::(I have listed my extensive arguments below (will try to make in more concise soon)  )
*Points against are:
:The sources are poor for establishing this as being historically significant or noteworthy, as they are either involved or passing mentions. 
:The sources may not be entirely reliable. 
:Inclusion of this detail may be considered promotional, since it's adding length by including a routine detail outside of due weight.

The temple's recent history immediately prior to this invocation is very controversial for unrelated reasons explained in the article and at [[Prakashanand Saraswati]]. This doesn't reflect on this invocation other than as, mentioned above, an indicator of continuing activity. The majority of useful sources I found are about that controversy. The remainder were mostly routine event listings and similar or comments about size and architecture of the temple. I did not find any other usable sources mentioning this invocation.

 Problems with two-part last names in citations '''

While improving the citations in this article, I ran into a problem that brought me to a halt. One of the sources has the last name "Van Flandern," and when I entered that name as a "ref name" before the citation, I kept getting an error message stating that there were "too many names" in the reference. Thanks to a sudden flash of insight, I condensed the ref name from "Van Flandern" to "VanFlandern," and that solved the immediate problem. (There was no problem entering "Van Flandern" in the actual citation, using the citation template for a magazine article.)

However, this is a glitch in the system and really does need to be fixed! I hate to think how many other people have had the same immensely frustrating experience. BTW, the template section has no wisdom to offer on this issue.

To make sure this comment is as clear as possible, here are the two versions of the reference, first the one that got the error message, then the one that was accepted:

<ref name=Van Flandern>{{citation |last=Van Flandern ... [if I write the entire citation, it doesn't show up here]

<ref name=VanFlandern>{{citation |last=Van Flandern ... [again, I can't enter the entire citation – it incorrectly becomes a citation for this comment]

(This strikes me as yet another glitch...)

Thanks in advance to anyone who can fix this![[User:Ailemadrah|Ailemadrah]] ([[User talk:Ailemadrah|talk]]) 18:01, 17 January 2017 (UTC)}}

'''Proposal''': A7 <s>and G11</s> CSD tags should not be applied to new articles within the first 30 minutes of creation and that the templates be modified to alert editors when they are being applied too hastily. When templates are improperly applied too quickly to newly created articles they should be ignored and or removed. This proposal does not affect other CSD tags which may still be applied as needed. The CSD guidelines shall be modified to reflect this change upon adoption by the community. 

'''Rationale''': Tag bombing newly created articles within minutes, and sometimes seconds of creation appears to be a recurring problem. There have been instances where this has been done to new editors working on their first article and I can imagine how discouraging it must be. Giving editors a chance to flesh out their new article to demonstrate the notability of the subject and ensure that the language is NPOV compliant before nominating for speedy deletion does not strike me as a threat to the integrity of the project. -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 15:48, 2 January 2017 (UTC)}}

This article has few watchers, so it has mostly been Castncoot and I bumping heads.

The crux of the dispute as I understand it is:
* Castncoot understands that because biotechnology is a form of technology, any discussion of "technology" anywhere in Wikipedia also should include "biotechnology", and likewise any discussion of the "tech industry" by default should include the "biotech industry".  That includes this article.  For Castncoot this is a "blue sky" obvious thing. 
* In my understanding, the reliable sources about Silicon Alley discuss it as a cluster of companies in the "tech industry" and use that term to refer to "companies that work in the IT/digital/software space";  the refs about Silicon Alley don't discuss biotech companies, and refs about the biotech industry in NYC don't associate it with Silicon Alley.  (For refs, see the section above, [[Talk:Silicon_Alley#Refs_galore_that_tech_and_biotech_industries_are_distinct_in_general_and_wrt_Silicon_Alley|here]], which are not cited in the article now.)

This already happens a little bit but there has been no actual community grant to allow this to happen. TFD already allows this per [[WP:BADNAC]]. Due to the extremely low participation at FFD and the even lower admin participation I would like to have the community grant non-admins the ability to close FFD discussions as delete. Afterwards the {{tl|db-xfd}} template would be used on the file page to indicate that the image is ready for deletion. This would massively help reduce the backlog by allowing competent individuals who have a handle on file maintenance tasks the ability to close discussions in this manner. Of course, the deleting administrator would be responsible for double checking but with discussions that are still open from August I don't see any other alternative.<p>Note: I have posted a notice on [[WT:FFD]] and will be posting this to [[T:CENT]] in a moment. --[[User:Majora|Majora]] ([[User talk:Majora|talk]]) 22:30, 28 December 2016 (UTC)}}

Klyosov described his "DNA genealogy" as a "patriotic science". Between 2010 and 2016 Klyosov published 10 books in the field, in which he made "outlandish claims". In some of his journal publications Klyosov tried to refute the Out of Africa hypothesis and proposed his alternative Into Africa theory.

I had attempted to revert back to Dec 2015 and readd all of the edits however it would've took forever and was way too much so I had self-reverted and decided to start an RFC, Thanks, –[[User:Davey2010|<span style="color:#147A44;">'''Davey'''</span><span style="color:#C4061C;">'''2010'''</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Davey2010|<span style="color:#147A44;">Merry Xmas</span> / <span style="color:#C4061C;">Happy New Year</span>]]</sup> 23:34, 27 December 2016 (UTC)}}

:The [[Legal Tender Cases]] were done because there were groups in the South that refused to accept the dollar. The Supreme Court later found that the dollar is legal tender and cannot be refused by anyone for payments within the United States. That was to ensure that the confederates could not reject the currency or start their own. No other currency is legal tender so it cannot be legally required to be accepted or paid with. Sources not saying this are original research or fringe because they disagree with the Supreme Court, which is the only arbitrary of Constitutionality in the United States.

Should we keep the current design of this template concerning the presidencies of the United States, or consider a redesign? The issue was discussed above but without a consensus, with one user ({{u|Marbe166}}) in favour and one ({{u|Drdpw}}) opposed. The reason why I feel the template should be revamped is rather straightforward; it looks more or less like a copy of {{tl|US Presidents}} (with only terms of office to set them both apart), and a redesign would help differentiate it from that template and give it its own sort of feel. Furthermore, I chose to separate the presidents by era (rather than by century or whatnot) given that many regard the Civil War, WW2 and the Cold War as pivotal epochs in American history. Thoughts are much welcome.--[[User:Neve-selbert|Nev&eacute;]][[Special:Contributions/Neve-selbert|&ndash;]][[User talk:Neve-selbert|selbert]] 04:07, 23 January 2017 (UTC)}}

The current 1st paragraph of the lead says (with very extensive referencing removed and with the word "pseudoscientific" bolded):

* '''Current version''':   Intelligent design (ID) is the '''pseudoscientific''' view that "certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection."  Educators, philosophers, and the scientific community have demonstrated that ID is a religious argument, a form of creationism which lacks empirical support and offers no testable or tenable hypotheses. Proponents argue that it is "an evidence-based scientific theory about life's origins" that challenges the methodological naturalism inherent in modern science, while conceding that they have yet to produce a scientific theory. The leading proponents of ID are associated with the Discovery Institute, a politically conservative think tank based in the United States.  Although they state that ID is not creationism and deliberately avoid assigning a personality to the designer, many of these proponents express belief that the designer is the Christian deity.

People have expressed a desire to change the '''style''' so that the word "pseudoscience" appears a) later, and b) as a noun instead of an adjective. 

*'''Alternative 1''':   Intelligent design (ID) is the view that "certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection."

The last formal discussion was held one year and a half ago, and can be seen [[Talk:Stanley_Kubrick/Archive_7#No_Infobox|here]]. There was another attempt at a discussion [[Talk:Stanley Kubrick/Archive 8|just last month]], which suffered from insufficient participation and was accidentally archived preventing discussion being continued. As [[WP:Consensus can change|consensus can change]] and there has been renewed discussion (which can be seen just above), let's try and have a civil RfC on this so we can establish the current consensus.

'''Question:''' Should an infobox be added to this page?

'''Background''': [[Wikipedia:Recent years|Recent Years]] is a set of editing guidelines for articles on events of global significance for an entire year, for example [[2014]]. It is not binding on any other subset of articles pertaining to years  that are not recent, such as [[1865]], or articles about certain subjects in a given year such as [[2011 in Australian television]], or [[2011 in film]]  and so forth. Recent years guidelines are not used as inclusion criteria for content anywhere else on Wikipedia, including the main page. 

The issue this RFC aims to address is the fact that these guidelines were put into place and are maintained by a very small group of users, and indeed many if not most Wikipedians may not be aware of them at all, unless they try to insert material into an article on a given year (usually the current one) and suddenly find themselves faced with a number of new rules they never knew existed, being enforced by a small group of users who specialize in this area. Policy decisions in this area are sometimes made by as little as two or three users. It appears that the decision to make it an official editing  guideline was made by a single user.  

This is not intended to suggest that these users have been acting in bad faith, they have worked tirelessly to uphold what rules they have in an area of Wikipedia that seems to suffer from a lack of broad particpation. Constantly dealing with the same isssues day after day, year after year with little to no support or interest from the broader community can be understably frustrating. 

'''For an idea of what these conversations are like and how many of them there are, see the talk page of any article on a year between [[2002]] and [[2017]].'''

Therefore, this RFC will attempt to mitigate some of these issues by calling for broader input on the rules used in recent years articles in order to make it apparent if the community at large supports them or not. Discussion will include the scope of the guideline, tools for improving awareness of it, and a review of some of the specifc points included in it, as well as the question of whether it should be a guideline at all.

There is a dispute in the [[Star_Trek:_Discovery#Cast_and_characters|"Cast and characters"]] section over the addition of a line-break after the colon whenever the description that follows is longer than (some amount). [[MOS:TVCAST]] (the primary style guideline for the dispute) has no use or mention of hard line-breaks for the middle of any character's entry (just at the end). 

In summary of the above discussion: those in favor of the added line-break argue that other article's having similar formatting is sufficient reason for their use; while those against added line-breaks argue that it is not a part of any formatting guideline. Is ''use elsewhere'' sufficient defense here, or is ''adherence to manuals'' reason enough to change it? Please add your vote and any additional arguments in this section now.

{{rfcquote|text=
From what I can find there still are no guidelines for the categorisation of wildlife by location. If there is I would be grateful if someone could point it out, if not one needs to be generated. A disagreement has arisen between myself and another user as to the appropriate method of categorisation of fauna, in particular in relation to bird species. I find it difficult to fairly put forward the opposing point of view here, in part because the user has not been explicit in our discussions as to the underlying rationale behind his methodology. The user has been working for some time altering the existing categorisations of birds, and as such is quite unwelcoming of any suggestion that his methodology is not the correct one, and quite resistant to any suggestions of change. Unfortunately he is also, in my opinion, quite unable to express why he is doing what he is doing. Needless to say I don't agree with his methodology, and for the article from which this issue originated I was happier with the categories that had already existed, and felt that his changes were a negative. He has taken the relative lack of opposition to his previous changes as sign of other editors condoning it. 

Thus I can only put forward my suggestions as a starting point to a possible set of guidelines. The basic principle is the ease and simplicity in using the categories for navigating Wikipedia for a reader who might be searching for a bird or birds in a locality for which he/she has only a vague description, idea and no name. In this sense for it to act in the same manner as a library of bird guidebooks.
The basic design of the methodology might look something like this
:1) That geographic categorisation of species should be clearly explained in the category pages. 
:2) That the level at which the species are found should be, unless there is good reason, and that reason is explained on the category pages, all at the same level. This is so that the reader does not need to hunt through several pages of categories in order to find what they need. 
:3) What these levels are need not be fixed, but they need to be self-consistent - in other words do not start categorising species until all subcategories are sorted out (this is so the reader is not left guessing in which category there animal might be found). Given that countries have already been set up and that these are simple concepts for the reader (as opposed to ecogeographical zones). 
:4) Thus the simplest method is to list all species by country only, unless there is good reason, and the reason is stated in the appropriate parent category article.
:5) All of the areas must be listed and be complete - in other words no areas are not included - otherwise the reader will go to that category and not find the animal that they are looking for. 
:6) how many categories are displayed at the bottom of the page is relatively unimportant, however some species have near global distributions, in which case these creatures are not put into country categories and are instead put in the global or near global distribution category. If this becomes too full then this is subcategorised into the continents but no further. 
:7) creatures that are restricted to one or two countries may be broken down into one further subcategory, but again only with it made clear in the category article.
:8) Categories are listed on an article page in alphabetical order, this is the only objective system. Otherwise it makes it hard to find them - note the display of categories at the bottom of articles is more for the benefit of the editors than it is for the readers, though readers may find them useful also 
:9) includes regular migrant birds and established introduced species 
:10) This is my proposed methodology based on the principles of a) what categorisation is used for b) self-consistent objective categorisation that is simple for the reader to follow c) acknowledging the underlying limitations in determining distributions of species.
:Any comments or help would be greatly appreciated.[[User:Jameel the Saluki|Jameel the Saluki]] ([[User talk:Jameel the Saluki|talk]]) 12:41, 3 January 2017 (UTC)}}

A new RM is out of the question, so in line with the comments in [[Talk:Thomas Mair (murderer)#Assassin category]], which one of these should be included in the article, and why?

#"Assassination" categories, such as "Scottish assassins".

Is this article ([[Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War]]) part of the wider topic of [[Military intervention against ISIL]]?

I doubt that many would dispute that Turkish forces are now (winter 2016/7) attacking ISIL in and around Al-Bab. But Turkey has also attacked various SDF positions too. And some would suggest that not long ago Turkey was tolerant of ISIL, possibly even allowing them to be supported via Turkey.

An alternative view might be that the articles naturally overlap, but that neither is part of the other. [[User:Batternut|Batternut]] ([[User talk:Batternut|talk]]) 20:38, 3 January 2017 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
'''Background''': There was considerable concerns raised during a recent request for resysop [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Bureaucrats%27_noticeboard&oldid=758170560#Resysop_request_.28Cyp.29] as to whether the existing activity requirements are sufficient. Namely, after years of minimal activity, can an administrator have sufficient knowledge of the ever-evolving community expectations and standards to effectively carry out their additional responsibilities? A perusal of the contribution histories of administrators with few logged actions over their years with the project will show many cases where the last 50 edits commonly date back several years - as far as 2008.

'''Proposed change''': The existing policy for admin activity is procedural removal after one year with no edits or logged actions. A user whose bit has been removed can ask for the bit to be restored at [[WP:BN]] until such point they have been inactive for three years straight. 

This policy is modified as follows.

# An administrator is desysoped for inactivity if he or she makes '''less than 50 edits and logged actions combined''' in the preceding year 
# To regain the bit, a new RfA will be required.
# If an administrator has previously requested a desysop, they must meet the activity threshold to remain exempt from RfA.
# Wikibreak clause: at the bureaucrats' discretion, an administrator can be temporarily exempted from this requirement by posting a notice to [[WP:BN]] that declares an absence in advance. In that case, the months in question are skipped for the inactivity calculation. As an example, for an activity calculation for two months ''after'' the break, the 10 months prior and 2 months after the break are considered for the 50 edits + logged actions. 
# The activity requirement applies equally to holders of other advanced permissions, e.g. bureaucrats.

'''Rationale''': By adopting a standard where an administrator remains a somewhat active member of the community, regardless of using the admin toolset or not, ensures that there is more confidence from the community that they have an adequate knowledge of the ever-changing standards and best practices. In recognition of the common practice in the past and present to give sysop tools to trusted editors without the expectation that the editor will shift solely to administrative aspects (e.g. just deleting stuff), the proposed inactivity metric does not consider logged administrative actions exclusively. Furthermore, this metric would include non-logged administrative actions such as editing protected pages. This proposed inactivity criterion is in response to recent events and in an attempt to improve on the deficiencies of the two previous RfCs on the topic. A "wikibreak clause" is added to account for administrators on temporary leave who intend to return as an active editor in the future, in contrast to editors who do not foresee being active again.

{{rfcquote|text=
There are currently several discussions ([[User_talk:Rathfelder#Idiosyncratic_Wikipedians|1]], [[User_talk:Rathfelder#Removing_categories_from_user_pages_.28again.21.29|2]], [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2016_December_22#Category:People_paid_by_Big_Pharma_to_schill|3]], [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2017_January_4#Category:Former_US_President_Wikipedians|4]]) ongoing as to whether Wikipedians should be allowed to keep redlinked user categories on their user (and user talk) pages.  This was prompted by [[User:Rathfelder]] creating numerous categories that were previously redlinked, and placing them in [[:Category:Idiosyncratic Wikipedians]].  All of the categories created in this manner that have been brought to CfD thus far have been deleted (for violating this guideline) since the vast majority of them are some form of joke category.  Rathfelder's rationale behind this action was that he is working on redlink cleanup, and that these categories remaining as redlinks are impeding that process: see reports such as [[Special:WantedCategories]], with a large number of previously deleted user categories.  It has been suggested in a series of early [[WP:IAR|IAR]] CfD closures that this issue needs a centralized RfC to determine what our course of action should be on this issue.

Currently, the status quo is that anything violating [[WP:USERCAT]] will be deleted at CfD, and ''sometimes'' the categories are emptied when such a CfD closes.  In my experience administrators closing such discussions are not always familiar with user categories and often follow the process as they would any other CfD and empty them.  Other times, the category is deleted and all users remain.  There has never been an official policy ruling on this - the idea, I suppose, is that the categories being deleted alone is sufficiently within policy, while users are not required to remove themselves from the category per our much more lax guidelines in the userspace.  This has mostly worked out up until now - Rathfelder was recently blocked for removing a redlinked category from a user page, while in the past users have [[User_talk:SchmuckyTheCat/Archive_3#Wikipedians_by_religion|been threatened with a block]] (and ultimately their page protected from editing) for re-adding themselves to user categories (a bit different from the issue at hand as that was a container category, but I would submit is still similar).

I should note that, as with any category, it being red-linked ''alone'' is not really the concern here.  For instance, if there were a redlink on a user's page titled [[:Category:Wikipedians interested in collaborating on topics related to Oregon State University]] (Something I've been thinking about creating and placing myself in recently), that category would not violate this guideline as it would be likely to help foster collaboration - the best way to deal with this would be to actually create the category.  The main concern here is a user placing one's self in a category that's already been determined by consensus at CfD that the category is not helpful to the project - For instance, all the users in [[:Category:Wikipedians who oppose censorship]] remaining in the category after a CfD resulting in delete.

It appears that we have come to the point where we need some guidance as to the community's thoughts on this issue.  In my view, there are four schools of thought on this:
#''"Redlinks on userspace pages for categories that have previously been deleted are disruptive to encyclopedia building because they hinder those working on redlink cleanup, and we should empty these categories at the conclusion of CfDs and continue to remove userspace pages from them if they are added.  Any user violating consensus by re-adding such categories should be warned, and, if necessary, have their userpage protected from editing."''
#''"Redlinks on userspace pages for categories that have previously been deleted are disruptive to encyclopedia building because they hinder those working on redlink cleanup, but punishing users for re-adding these categories is going too far.  It should be standard practice to remove users from these categories at the conclusion of a CfD, and perhaps periodically purge such categories, but there should be no repercussions for users who want to re-add the category to their page."''
#''"We should more or less maintain the status quo - Anytime a CfD for a user category is closed, it will not be emptied. Redlinks at the bottom of their userspace pages are not disruptive to the project."''
#''"I disagree with the central reasoning that these types of categories should not exist in the first place.  We should get rid of the redlinks by making them blue and modify [[WP:USERCAT]] to allow for as much leeway as userspace content traditionally has. User categories should not need to directly benefit the encyclopedia as a precondition for existing."''

Should the documentation for the name parameter be edited to indicate what the capitalization rule is for unit names (and the examples edited to agree)? Should the capitalization of the name be similar to the title of an article or section (e.g. "Watt") or as it would be if the name appeared mid-sentence (e.g. "watt")?

'''Unit name capitalization discussion'''

As the proposer of this RfC, I favor capitalizing unit names as they would be capitalized if the unit name appeared mid-sentence (e.g. "The watt is a unit of power"). I observe that editors frequently capitalize the name of units which are named after people when the unit appears mid-sentence; using mid-sentence capitalization would help to reduce this error. It would be similar to the way dictionaries are written; a dictionary entry is capitalized as if it occurred mid-sentence, even though it is the first word in the entry.

As of Jan 9, [[Adult-oriented rock]] redirects to [[Album-oriented rock]] even though "adult-oriented rock" doesn't appear in this article. The dispute over including these sentences comes from the fact that "adult-oriented rock" is a loosely defined term, sometimes also referring to [[Arena rock]] or [[Yacht rock]], which are not radio formats. Some sources (cited above) say that the terms are regionally dependent, and that "album-oriented rock" was the format as it was known in the US. Other people claim (without sources) that "album-oriented rock" was the official name of the radio format described in this article, and that "adult-oriented rock" is a meaningless term that ought to denote [[Adult album alternative]] (this notion is also contradicted by music industry textbooks).<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=tdgdAQAAMAAJ&q=%22adult-oriented+rock%22+%22adult+album+alternative%22&dq=%22adult-oriented+rock%22+%22adult+album+alternative%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOxenWs7bRAhWE7yYKHa-lAFoQ6AEIJDAB</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HOaBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA111 ''Understanding the Music Industries'' by Chris Anderton, Andrew Dubber, Martin James]</ref>

The name ''Al-Raqqah'' is not the most common usage (required by [[MOS:TITLE]]), nor is it basic transliteration (see [[WP:MOSAR]]), so it should be moved.

Simple google hit count estimates (when google says ''About 383,000 results'') gives 755k for ''"Raqqa" -"al-Raqqa" -"al-Raqqa"'', and from 85k to 572k for other options. Google's estimates are pretty wild of course. Google book search gives 644 ''actual'' results (ie after tediously paging through the results until it actually runs out of real result), compared with from 107 to 334 for the other options.

This issue concerns  all the  [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] villages depopulated in the  [[1948 Arab-Israeli war]], and all the Israeli settlements which were built on their lands after 1948.
The "standard"  text book  used here is:
*{{cite book|title=All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_By7AAAAIAAJ |first1=Walid|last1=Khalidi|authorlink=Walid Khalidi|year=1992|location=[[Washington D.C.]]|publisher=[[Institute for Palestine Studies]]|isbn=0-88728-224-5|id=ISBN 0-88728-224-5 }}

Should these villages be called "Arab" or  "Palestinian"? Or perhaps  "Arab Palestinian"? I have argued that they should be called  "Palestinian", as that is what their source say, and that is what is most unambiguous. Another editor  (Number 57) has argued that   ""Palestinian" is not a helpful term here because it does not clarify to the reader whether it was a Jewish or Arab village."  Outside views are welcome.

Should the intro be changed to the following: The '''Indus Valley Civilisation''' ('''IVC''') was a [[Bronze Age]] [[civilisation]] (3300–1300 BCE; mature period 2600–1900 BCE) mainly in the northwestern regions of the [[Indian Subcontinent]], primarily centred in [[Pakistan]] and Northwest India extending into Northeast [[Afghanistan]].

In spite of my efforts to avoid the issues contained in the maintenance tags placed on this article, it is possible I may have failed. I have a COI clearly declared above. I ask for a review by an independent editor of the content contained with consideration of the following responses:
* "press release:" it is very difficult to write about such person without the article sounding promotional. For example, Gosden et al. (1994) has been cited in 1069 published scientific journals. Now that is inappropriate promotional tone. Consider [https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/molehr/gas003 this reference], a journal article written by the editor of [[Molecular Human Reproduction]]. Please make edits to avoid such tone.
* "self-published sources" according to [[WP:BLPSPS]] these are clearly permitted as they are written by the subject. Primary sources are only used to in accordance with [[WP:BLPSELFPUB]] and only to support simple facts like where he worked, or that such and such was published, not about the significance of said work. For those secondary sources are used.
* "'''[[Wikipedia:Writing better articles#Tone|encyclopedic tone]]'''": this is perhaps an unintentional case of [[WP:TAGBOMB]] as the intended issue is covered by "press release." The article is written in [[WP:FORMAL|formal]] tone and avoids [[jargon]] as much as possible in accordance with [[MOS:JARGON]]. Therefore this tag is completely inappropriate.
I will refrain from editing this article any further until a RfC review is completed. &mdash; አቤል ዳዊት<sup>[[Help:Multilingual support (Ethiopic)|<span class="t nihongo icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span>]]</sup>[[User:Janweh64|(Janweh64)]] ([[User talk:Janweh64|talk]]) 18:58, 11 February 2017 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
One view is that per [[WP:NOTDICT]], the two topics should be kept separate since they are two completely different definitions. "Both definitions of 'scare quote' are supported by several citations. The definitions do not match and are clearly unrelated to one another. That is sufficient to prevent them from being in the same article unless that article satisfies [[WP:WORDISSUBJECT]], which the article did not." The other view is that it's common to include different definitions of a term in one article, that we should only split content when necessary (see [[WP:Spin out]] and [[WP:No split]]), that [[WP:Stub|stub articles]], especially those that are unlikely to grow beyond stubs, are not ideal, and that there should at least be reliable sources stating that a scare-line is completely different from a scare quote. In this case, we have sources stating an alternative definition of a scare quote. Alternative definitions commonly go in the same article. 

For those seeing this from a RfC page or from your talk page, see [[Talk:Scare-line#WP:Content fork]] for more on the arguments. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 21:52, 13 January 2017 (UTC)}}

# The New Page Patrol is a key part of ensuring that Wikipedia's new content is of a good quality, meets guidelines and filters out vandalism and attack pages.
# Recently, there has been a rise in the number of sub-standard articles and pure advertisement articles being created by non-autoconfirmed users and IPs.
# The backlog is steadily growing and may soon reach 20,000.
# Patrollers need a period in which the backlog can be cut down more easily without more pages with undesirable content being added faster than they can patrol.

Antibiotics mechanism of action are either bactericidal or bacteriostatic. They can also have antiprotozoal actions. However this is not clear or not specified for many of the individual antibiotic pages. I note this article on Doxycycline is an example where the mechanism of action of doxycycline is not clearly specified. I would argue that by a concerted effort to edit in this information across all individual pages on antibiotics would greatly improve the quality of all those articles on Wikipedia. Does anyone wish to comment or if appropriate circulate this matter for further discussion?

{{rfcquote|text=
see preceding discussion above.

the article is being disputed as nnpov, for deliberately seeking to downplay the crimes committed, casualty estimates, use of "euphemistic" vocabulary, the use of false equivalents, & minimising belgian/european colonial responsibility for the actions taken.

the primary author of this (who previously sought the article's ''deletion'' in its previous form, see:  [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Congolese Genocide]]) has repeatedly reverted ''multiple'' other editor's attempts to revise their text, to create a more balanced tone; even including the removal of historical photographs, & exclusion of period sources.

this editor has been completely ''intransigent'' & impenetrable to any attempt to change their "take" on this history.

the editor also has the charming habit of selectively misrepresenting other editor's positions in a discussion.

i'm done; i am out of time, out of patience, & out of "agf" for this person.  the article is crap, & i would vote to delete it, "merge" it back into the main c.f.s. article ''anytime''.  it ''adds nothing'' to the coverage already there.

rfc, ''have at it''

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
At the [[Pedophilia]] article, there is a dispute regarding linking the term ''[[prepubescent]]''. One view is that linking the term helps readers understand what prepubescence is and/or the topic of pedophilia. This view asserts that "''prepubescence'' and ''preadolescence'' are presented under the same title in Wikipedia, with the nuances in meaning offered therein. We should treat the terms as Wikipedia treats them." The other view is that the link is misleading and confusing since the term ''prepubescent'' currently redirects to the Preadolescence article, and prepubescence and preadolescence are not the same thing, which is why preadolescence is usually designated as ages 10 to 13 and can include pubescents, while ''prepubertal'' is broader in age range and is specifically about those who have not reached puberty. This view asserts that the sending readers to the Preadolescence article will hinder the understanding of pedophilia, which medically relies on the prepubescent aspect. 

If you are seeing this from an RfC page or your talk page, the initial discussion on the matter can be seen at [[Talk:Pedophilia#Links to articles about puberty, adolescence, etc]]. Options for how to resolve the dispute are presented below. 

'''Option 1''': Simply link the term ''prepubescent''.

'''Option 2''': Link the term ''prepubescent'', but add a Prepubescence section to the Preadolescence article and redirect the term ''prepubescent'' there. Creating a Prepubescence section at the Preadolescence article can obviously be an option regardless of what is decided here at the Pedophilia article, but it has been explicitly suggested as a compromise.     

'''Option 3''': Use "who have not begun [[puberty]]" in place of "prepubescent," [https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pedophilia&oldid=5493675 like Simple English Wikipedia does] for its first sentence.

As reported in multiple sources, Mrs. Trump has brought libel suits in the U.S., most recently in New York, concerning allegations originally published in ''[[The Daily Mail]]''. These new developments are not a simple rehash of the original, inflammatory allegations, but rather delve into how Mrs. Trump is protecting her brand. Multiple reliable sources are reporting on this, including ''[[The New York Times]]'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/us/politics/melania-trump-libel-suit-daily-mail.html in this article] and accompanying editorial[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/opinion/melania-trump-inc-imperiled.html].

The questions we need to address is 

1. whether the libel suits should be mentioned 

2. if so, to what extent, if at all, should the original allegations published by the ''Mail'' be mentioned? 

3. Should they be included as a separate section or subsection?

{{rfcquote|text=
The Wikimeda Foundation is working on a new software project called New Wikitext Editor (also known as NWE, or 2017 Wikitext Editor). The "new editor" is being built as a new wikitext mode within the Visual Editor extension. This allows the WMF to consolidate on a single editor with both Visual and wikitext modes. The plan is for this to become the default wikitext editor in a few months. The current wikitext editor would be temporarily retained as an opt-in in preferences, but eventually the current wikitext editor would be removed completely. Please view [[mw:2017_wikitext_editor]] for a more thorough explanation of the project, as well as the WMF's reasons for it. The new editor is available for opt-in testing under the [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures| Beta features section of Preferences]].

The WMF is still working on a number of issues with the new software, however over the last few months several editors have raised a pair of issues which (in my opinion) they have not constructively addressed. Both of these issues appear to be a direct consequence of designing the "new wikitext editor" as a mode within Visual editor. The issues are:
# Slow load time, primarily on larger articles. Different people may experience different load times, but I will report my experience. With the current wikitext editor I am able to start editing the article [[United States]] within <u>3 seconds</u> after clicking edit. (The toolbar at top took a moment longer to finish loading, but that does not obstruct editing.) The new editor took <u>30 seconds</u> to load before I could begin editing. With the current wikitext editor it took <u>5 seconds</u> until I could edit our largest article ([[List of named minor planets (numerical)]]). With the new editor my load time was <u>127 seconds</u>.
# Faulty previews. The new editor does not provide genuine article-view previews. Instead it uses the Visual Editor rendering engine for previews. This results in a large assortment of things that render incorrectly in preview, or fail to render at all. The WMF has been working to address these issues for years as part of the Visual Editor work, and they plan to continue hunting down and fixing many of these rendering problems. However the WMF has indicated that some of these rendering problems are CANTFIX or WONTFIX. They hope to address the common cases, and their goal is to eventually get 99+% correct previews.

The WMF has been developing a [[mw:Technical_Collaboration_Guideline/Community_decisions|Technical Collaboration Guideline]]. According to the guideline, the community is invited to submit "actionable blockers" on any software project. These are issues that block deployment unless/until the issues are adequately resolved. This RFC is seeking consensus to formally submit the one or both issues as actionable blockers. You may support one issue as a proposed blocker while opposing the other.

'''EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION:''' The WMF has been <u>developing</u> a Technical Collaboration Guideline. It is currently a draft. At least one WMF staff member has been actively seeking to test the guideline in action ([[User:Qgil-WMF|Qgil-WMF]]) and another WMF staff member subsequently requested removal of any mention of the guideline ([[User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]]). Editors are reminded that it is merely a draft. This RFC ''could'' be interpreted by the WMF as a test of their draft best practices for collaboration with us, or it could be interpreted as some generic consensus on the New Editor's prospects for successful deployment if specific issues are or are not addressed, or it could be interpreted in some other manner. In any case, our goal is to work with each other as partners in a positive and constructive manner, seeking to serve our shared mission to the best of our ability.

Does CVUA have a policy regarding activity of trainers on their student's CVUA pages? Many CVUA pages have hardly been updated in months even though students are active and presumably awaiting evaluation of their work. They have to keep notifying their instructor about the CVUA which has led me to suppose that these trainers are hardly taking CVUA seriously, having voluntarily signed up to be one and not even taking responsibility for it. As such, I am thinking that a policy should be in force to ensure that the list of trainers should be active. Any suggestions?

===Proposal'''

'''Should the creation of articles directly into the mainspace be restricted to autoconfirmed users for a trial period of six months?'''

This would be implemented by a Phabricator software request should consensus be found.

'''Technicalities'''

I respect that many editors feel that this matter needs more discussion however I think that it is of paramount importance that this issue is addressed quickly to prevent the exponential growth of the backlog which will soon become unmanageable.

Due to the expedient nature of this request, the technicalities of the proposal e.g. templates will be the same as those used in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/Proposal_to_require_autoconfirmed_status_in_order_to_create_articles the original ACTRIAL request].

'''Considerations'''

# The huge backlog at [[Special:NewPagesFeed|New Pages Feed]] which was mentioned in the latest [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:DrStrauss/Archive_3#New_Page_Review_-_newsletter_No.2 newsletter].
# The corresponding increase in deletion of New Pages.
# The rise in "one page wonder" editors.

'''Effects'''

# Reduction of the backlog would facilitated for New Page Patrollers.
# Editor retention as page creators are likely to be put off by the deletion of their pages.
# A decrease in the amount of low-quality content coming in to Wikipedia.

'''Please contribute in the appropriate sections below.'''

'''Support'''

#'''Support''' While I support, per many of the reasons given in this RfC and in the prior discussion, I have my doubts as to whether anything has changed in regards to whether the Wikimedia Foundation will agree to implement it. <span style="background-color:yellow">[[User:Gluons12|<font face="Impact" color="red">Gluons12</font>]]</span> <sup>[[User_talk:Gluons12|☢]]&#124;[[Special:Contributions/Gluons12|☕]]</sup> 14:24, 19 February 2017 (UTC)}}

In March 2015, {{u|Moxy}} made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories,_lists,_and_navigation_templates&diff=651969670&oldid=647273163 a change to this guideline]. I see no consensus for this change. A few editors at [[User_talk:Robsinden#Interwikis_links]] have said that [[Wikipedia talk:Categories, lists, and navigation templates/Archive 9#RFC: Should Sister Project links be included in Navboxes?|this June/July 2015 RFC]] covers the topic at hand, but it is about [[Wikipedia:Wikimedia sister projects#Sister projects|sister project]] which is a different consideration. There has been no statement that we want to treat foreign language wikipedias like sister projects. The prior discussion was about templates that looked like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Marc_Chagall&oldid=720525575 this]. What is at issue is templates that look like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:The_Twelve_Chairs&oldid=760801739 this]. Do we want to show the readers redlinks with corresponding foreign language Wikipedia links next to them. These links take the reader to wikipeias with the content that would be at the English language redlink with the only additional action necessary being to hit the translate button. Do we want to send the reader to a link that has the exact content that they are interested in on a foreign Wikipedia. I don't think there has been a consensus not to send readers to such links.--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] <small>([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|T]] / [[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|C]] / [[WP:FOUR]] / [[WP:CHICAGO]] / [[WP:WAWARD]])</small> 17:32, 20 January 2017 (UTC)}}

'''Background''': The G13 speedy deletion can be used to delete rejected or unsubmitted Article-for-creation-process pages when they are not edited for 6 months by humans. It has long been known that the G13 is an unsatisfactory and problematic solution to deal with inactive drafts in the draft namespace. Two main problems are
# It is in conflict with the view "[[Wikipedia:There is no deadline]]." In fact, there is no mechanism to delete not-actively-edit pages in the main namespace.
# It is essentially an automated process: the draft pages can be and have been deleted regardless of their status or viability for further development.

In addition, in view of some editors, the criterion is inconvenient to use since it does not apply to non-AfC drafts.

I agree with Nonymous-raz. Vue.js is its own framework and should not be redirected to the JavaScript Templating page.

To redirect Vue.js to a page on JavaScript templating is either lazy, disingenuous, destructive, or downright manipulative.  Based on Nonymous-raz's first sentence above, it sounds like there once was a dedicated Vue.js page, which means it isn't lazy but rather an intentional misrepresentation.

Lee Grant is a famous actress who was born on October 31, some time between 1925 and 1931 according to secondary and tertiary sources, and 1925 and 1928 according to primary sources. It is the year that is contentious. Census records state she was 4 in 1930 and 14 in 1940. We can independently corroborate that Grant made her stage debut in November 1931, and in her autobiography she claims to have been 4 years old at the time (her debut was just a few weeks after birthday). She was nominated for an oscar in March 1952, at the age of 24 according to her autobiography. She was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee and promptly blacklisted for refusing to testify against her husband. At her hearing she gave her date of birth as October 31, 1926. She lost ten years of her career and after resuming it undertook a deception in regards to her age to obtain work. She admits to persuading the mayor to alter her date of birth on her driving licence to knock five years off her age. In some recent interviews the year given has been 1928, although such a date is inconsistent with the ages she gives in her autobiography. The question I put to the community is '''How should Grant's date of birth be presented in the article?'''

{{rfcquote|text=
{{t|infobox country at games}} currently offers two display options for navigating between appearances of a country at a games: the first is the standard "next/previous" option, where you can navigate forward or backward one appearances ([[Canada at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics|Example 1]]). The second is a navbox-style section with every appearance at the games shown ([[Canada at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Example 2]], [[Cambodia at the 2010 Asian Games|Example 3]]).

There have been previous discussions but all have petered out without a clear consensus. So I offer three options: keep only the next/previous, keep only the infobox-style, or keep both. [[User:Primefac|Primefac]] ([[User talk:Primefac|talk]]) 21:52, 21 January 2017 (UTC)}}

I hope that econ is the correct field for an RFC here. Somebody placed a "distinguish" hatnote on this page, directing users to [[Dodge Caravan]]. At Dodge Caravan, a hatnote also suggests that perhaps the user was looking for [[Cessna 208 Caravan]]. This seems a) illogical and b) against policy, as [[:Template:Distinguish|Distinguish]] is meant to separate articles that might be easily confused through spelling error, ie articles with titles that are very similar. This clearly falls afoul of [[Wikipedia:TRHAT|trivial uses]]. [[User:Kevjonesin|Kevjonesin]] argues that a user unfamiliar with cars would somehow get here by searching for "caravan", but such a search would take them to the disambiguation page, from where they could easily find the correct article. Thus, no need for these tags that litter pages for no reason. From [[WP:HAT]]: "''Only mention other topics and articles if there is a large possibility of a reader arriving at the article either by mistake or with another topic in mind''."

Background: Editors that revert the addition of an infobox comment on this page comment on the "consensus" reached at this talk page, however, IMO I cannot see one. Consensus can of course change as seen directly above, hence it would be beneficial to establish if there is any consensus for the addition of an infobox so that users trying to add/remove one can be directed to a formal discussion. This page formerly had an infobox until its removal by {{noping|FrB.TG}} in June 2016, leading to the discussion held above.

Question: Should an infobox be added to [[Kristen Stewart]]?

One view is that the article should use Johnson's maiden name for her contributions before marrying and that we should use her married name for her contributions after marrying; this is so that we are paying respect to Johnson's legacy as separate from her husband. The other view is that "Johnson" is her common name and current surname and that we should consistently use that throughout the article (unless using her maiden name is clearer for a certain part); doing so is not taking away from Johnson's legacy since she is commonly known as Katherine Johnson whether her contributions prior to marrying are being discussed/noted or not.

The parameter <code>Form=</code> is a carryover from the merger from Template:Infobox standard.  "Form" refers to a song's musical structure, e.g., repeating verses, sections, etc. (see [[Musical form]] for an explanation).  This is different than "Format" and "Genre", both of which have separate fields.  The Form parameter has little use and is often used incorrectly in place of genre or to mean style ("Jazz standard", "Ballad", etc.).  Very few articles discuss musical form or reference it.

I see from the edit notice that the current standard for inclusion on this list is coverage in reliable sources, per a discussion here in 2011. I think it may be time to review that decision and consider a simpler approach. Therefore I propose the following:

*'''All entries must have their own Wikipedia article. Entries with no article, or where the article has been deleted, will be removed. It will no longer be necessary to add sources when adding a new entry, a link to the Wikipedia article is sufficient."

Why is this better? It aligns this page with the [[WP:GNG]] and eliminates the need for debate here on the validity of an entry. If it can't support its own article, it will end up deleted, the link turns red, and it can be removed without controversy. If a new article is created with better sourcing that will stand up to scrutiny, it can be added back. All these discussion templates and so forth in  use here, like this was a noticeboard, can just be swept away as they won't be needed anymore. The edit notice and the notice at the top of this page can be reduced to ''one simple sentence that is not open to interpretation''. In short, it puts the onus on those wanting to add new entries to insure that the subject is sufficiently notable according to our long-accepted guidelines for inclusion ''before'' they are added here, thus eliminating the need for debate on this talk page, pushing it over to [[WP:AFD]] which is exactly where discussions of notability are supposed to take place.

Please comment if you can support the following new wording for the end of the election summary paragraph in the lede.
1. {{talkquote|...and the fifth president to have lost the popular vote.}}
Reasoning: I think "the fifth ___" is too abbreviated. "to have lost" because "to lose" implies he we president before he lost the popular vote. "losing the popular vote" is wording that many sources use even though it is not a contest to be won or lost or even part of any criteria for being president.

This guy: {{UAA|a}}

This is an exemption to the username policy that doesn't actually exist. It was made up by an admin who used to be very active here and just kind fo crept in to the process. The one time it was seriously discussed is [[Wikipedia:Username policy/RFC#"Only edits are to AFC submission"|here]], where a consensus was arrived at that it was not a valid exemption, but no actual action came from that. However, it does seem to have fallen out of favor and isn't really used anymore. I'd like to have this option removed from ResponseHelper as an invalid an mostly unused response, but have been asked to provide a more recent consensus not to use it first. Thoughts?

{{rfcquote|text=
In recent months I have come across two separate templates that were written in German to facilitate the copying and pasting of Infoboxes from the German Wiki to the English Wiki: [[Template:Infobox Fluss]] (German Rivers) and [[Template:Infobox Schienenfahrzeug]] (German Railway Vehicles). I am really having a hard time understanding the logic behind having a template on the ENGLISH wiki where the parameters are in German. The argument in favor of this, that multiple editors have made, is so that one can easily copy and paste data from the German wiki. That is an absurd reason IMHO. You can't copy and paste the whole page anyway because it has to be translated. The same should be true for the Infobox. This whole infobox should be in English. I feel that this opens up a dangerous precedent as you could make that same argument with any page, in any topic and any language... For example, I would like to be able to copy and paste soccer teams from the Spanish Wiki... So do we now create a [[Template:Infobox football club]] that is in spanish so that I can copy and paste this data? 

Additionally, why are you copying and pasting data from another Wiki?? Other Wikis are certainly not [[WP:RS]]... Now I want to be super clear here, before anyone [[WP:ABF]], this has nothing to do with being anti-german or anything like that! What this actually grew out of was me converting Infoboxes to use {{tl|Infobox}} as a base. I had a hard time with these two templates because the parameters were completely foreign to me (not speaking any German myself). 

My goal here with this policy request is to establish a firm policy around whether or not foreign languages can be used in Infoboxes. There are obvious exceptions and this is not a debate about whether we are using "color" or "colour"... but I feel strongly that having entire Infoboxes written with all parameters in a foreign language is not good practice for an English Wiki. 

'''If''' the decision is made to implement a policy that all Infoboxes should be written in English, then I will commit to converting not only all templates that are in a foreign language, but also to converting all transclusions. I don't think the fact that these transclusions already exist should be part of the discussion as to whether or not they should continue to be used. I should also say that if there are certain individuals who feel the need to continue to copy and paste templates from foreign language wikis, I don't see any reason that custom templates cannot be written that once substituted are converted to their English equivalent. 

I also want to be clear that this discussion is NOT about merging templates. There are separate conversations about whether [[Template:Infobox German railway vehicle]] and [[Template:Infobox locomotive]] should be merged (for example). That is NOT the topic here! This is simply about whether or not to use foreign language in the Infobox. 

I look forward to hearing discussion on both sides. --[[User:Zackmann08|<span style="color:DarkTurquoise;">Zackmann08</span>]] (<sup>[[User_talk:Zackmann08|Talk to me]]</sup>/<sub>[[Special:Contributions/Zackmann08|<span style="color:orange;">What I been doing</span>]]</sub>) 19:11, 6 February 2017 (UTC)}}

Users may ask virtually any question, and other users may provide any answer they see fit. There is also persistent debate about questions that may be asking for medical or legal advice.

Previous attempts to bring the refdesks into line with practices followed on the  remainder of the site or to make it work more like a real reference desk, providing only referrals to the relevant material as opposed to open-ended answers subject to no particular guidelines have failed, largely due to resistance from regulars at the refdesks.

Therefore, this proposal '''will not attempt to change the basic functioning of the reference desks'''. The subject of the discussion shall be if we should require all reference desk pages to be tagged with templates identifying the key differences between them and the rest of Wikipedia, and also if any question that might be construed as requesting legal or medical advice be tagged with a special template before answers are posted.

I am trying to find an consensus for a standard of inclusion of specifications about the chip inside the [[Nintendo Switch]], though it is unconfirmed by the manufacturer. The reputability of the source publication has not been questioned. However the disagreement appears to be between:

* Include final and verified specs from the manufacturer, perhaps conveyed by a reliable source. Include specs from a credible third party with physical access to the final product.
* Include reported information of products prior to release from a reliable source. 

I believe this has already be addressed in the [[Talk:Jaguar_(microarchitecture)#PS4_Neo_APU_Specs|RfC here]]. However, my proposed compromise language based on this RfC has being rejected.

There is a requested move for this article. Consensus seems to be that a move is in order, but there is debate on the new title between "electoral system" and "voting rule". All parties agree that of those two options, "electoral system" is the more common term, but there is debate as to whether it precisely covers the scope of the article, either inclusively or exclusively. In the normal course of events, simply picking one of the options and closing the requested move, with a note that further debate is not out of order, would be acceptable; but since this move would mean moving several templates and categories, and possibly minor edits to the text of dozens of articles, it's probably worth broadening the discussion and getting a more-lasting consensus the first time.

For several years, the commonly-accepted but unofficial threshold for inclusion in the infobox of U.S. election articles has been receiving 5% of the vote. I am not aware of the exact discussion that established this policy (a link would be appreciated), but I will cite some similar past discussions: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Elections_and_Referendums/Archive_6#5.25_Threshold_rule_needs_a_vote this one] from 2010 regarding inclusion based on poll results, and two at [[Talk:United States Senate election in Illinois, 2010]] relating to the same topic.

This issue was brought up by [[Talk:United States presidential election in the District of Columbia, 2016|a recent RfC]] at the talk page of [[United States presidential election in the District of Columbia, 2016]] regarding the inclusion of [[Donald Trump]] in the infobox. Trump received 4% of the vote in the District.

Here are the options:

'''Question 1'''<br>
''What should be the standard for inclusion in the infobox of U.S. election articles?''
* A) Candidate must receive 5% of the vote
*B) Candidate must receive 4% of the vote ([[Talk:Vermont gubernatorial election, 2014#Libertarian candidate|see here]])
*C) Candidate must receive 5% of the vote or be the nominee of a major party (Democratic, Republican)

'''Question 2'''<br>
''If only one candidate meets the yet-to-be-defined-threshold, should the second-place contender be included?''
*A) If only one candidate meets the threshold, then the second-place contender should be included
*B) If only one candidate meets the threshold, then the second-place contender should not be included

I have seen several editors attempt to remove or add "rapper" to his BLP. However, the sources are contradictory.
*I am not going to accept this source http://www.famousbirthdays.example.com/people/daddy-yankee.html because it appears to just be facts aggregated from Wikipedia, and it neither confirms nor denies him being a rapper. It calls him a "World Music Singer" and a "Popular Latin recording artist".
*Google displayed this hit: http://www.axs.com/the-top-10-best-daddy-yankee-songs-83194. It says ''"For anybody that says that reggaeton is not really rapping, let us point you to “Gata Gangster.” This single is basically Puerto Rican rap, and that’s a good thing as the track is easily listenable and likeable, unlike most of the gangster rap that’s out today."'' That is what it says for number 9. check out the desc. for 7 and 4. ''Daddy Yankee may be the closest thing to a Spanish gangster rapper since, well, anybody.…though most of his tunes were geared towards “Latin gangster rap,”…''
*Billboard in 2012 called him both "Daddy Yankee, Puerto Rican Rapper" and "Reggaeton star Daddy Yankee " and "The Grammy-winning rapper" and "said the rapper". <ref>http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/branding/1099489/daddy-yankee-puerto-rican-rapper-to-release-signature-headphones</ref>

{{rfcquote|text=
This article describes the territorial dispute between the United Kingdom and Spain over Gibraltar. Within it there are three sections. The Spanish position, the British Position and the Gibraltarian Position. They each objectively describe the official position or Point of View of each party regarding this conflict.

It has been consistently argued by an editor that the official Spanish position summarized in English on the Spanish government website should not be included or referenced as a source because it is a Primary source and because it is POV.  A secondary source from the BBC summarizing the Spanish position and mirroring the Primary source has also been consistently deleted by the same editor. I strongly object to the validity and underlying logic of both arguments. As has been mentioned in the prior RfC by other uninvolved editors, Primary Sources can be used in such cases. Secondly, a section which aims to describes the Point of View of X party can hardly be written off as Point of View. We are describing the Spanish position, which IS inherently a Point of View, as are the British and Gibraltarian positions. 

The two sources which are considered unacceptable by the editor in question are the following:
*http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/gobierno/news/Paginas/2016/20160511--visits-gibralta.aspx (Spanish government website official position)
*http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23617910 (BBC online feature summarizing respective British and Spanish positions)

The question is: Should their content be excluded from the section and on what basis?

See [[:Category:Years in the future]] 

This is a follow-up on the discussion of the recent years guidelines further up the page. While looking into that mater, I discovered that we have articles on years in the future, going all the way up to [[2099]], and articles are future millennia going all the way up to the [[10th millennium]]. In addition to general information about predicted astronomical events and so forth, these articles contain speculative material as well as useless minutia such as what software may stop working properly  75-8,000 years in the future. While having articles for years in the immediate future seems reasonable, having articles for years that most of us will not even live to see, and cannot possibly predict, seems .... well frankly it just seems a bit silly. Should we develop a policy that prohibits articles on some future years? If so, what should be the cutoff?

{{rfcquote|text=
Studies suggest that "Ozark English" and "Appalachian English" are the same dialect (one an "extension" or separated "island" subset of the other); features of both traditional Ozark and Appalchian English may be declining, as evidenced by a lack of much Ozark-focused dialect research since the middle of the 1900s, as well as the recent classification of both the Ozark and (especially) Appalachian regions under the [[Southern American English|Southern dialect]] region by the 2006 ''[[Atlas of North American English]]''. Any sources that don't directly equate the two do consistently highlight their similarities, yet never their differences. 

The merging of the two articles has never happened, though I proposed it in the past on the [[Southern American English]] talk page. In that discussion, one user opposed without further discussion (even when asked to elucidate), one user brought up a single argument I feel I countered, and one user supported without further discussion. No full discussion was ever had over the course of at least 9 months, though I found and included later evidence to bolster my points. Below is my evidence in full supporting the merger: 
{{collapse top|title=Evidence|left=y}}
*The 1948 article "Southern Mountain Dialect", for example, refers to an Appalachian-Ozark variety as a single dialect with as much slight internal variation as any dialect: "Though fairly consistent in the isolated districts (with which we are mainly concerned), the dialect may vary slightly with the locality, and even from family to family." It lists "four main divisions" geographically, which include "the Blue Ridge of Virginia and West Virginia, the Great Smokies of Tennessee and North Carolina, the Cumberlands of Kentucky and Tennessee [all three constituting the Appalachian region], and the Ozarks of Arkansas and southern Missouri" [p. 46]). This passage unifies Appalachian and Ozark English.
*Here is what the more recent research that I could find has to say on Ozark English:
**[[John C. Wells]]' (1982) ''Accents of English'' lists "Ozarks" in the index with a "see also 'southern mountain'". Wells clearly centers "southern mountain" speech on Appalachian and "upland states", which "form a transition zone between the south and midland dialect areas; their southern mountain speech is classified as south midland by Kurath, but popularly regarded as a variety of southern accent" (527). This passage unifies Appalachian and Ozark English.
**"Variation and Change in Geographically Isolated Communities: Appalachian English and Ozark English" (1984), a 200-page comparative study, does initially speak of Appalachian and Ozark English as two different dialects or "varieties", yes, but the entire goal of the study is to unearth more about the relationships between the two. The conclusion states that the study considered "the descriptive detail of the [grammatical] structures we have examined, [and] the frequency with which the various structures are used" (p. 235). The findings of the study: "that there are no descriptive differences in the representative structures we have examined here" (p. 235) and then: "the frequency relationships between the varieties also shows fairly close parallels, with some non-significant differences" (p. 235). This passage unifies Appalachian and Ozark English.
** ''World Englishes'' (2013) plainly says "The Ozark Mountains can be seen as an extension of the Appalachian English dialect" (48). This passage unifies Appalachian and Ozark English. [[User:Wolfdog|Wolfdog]] ([[User talk:Wolfdog|talk]]) 14:37, 4 February 2017 (UTC)}}

=== Background '''

Our [[Wikipedia:Long-term abuse|Long-Term Abuse]] (LTA) pages are an extremely valuable repository for Wikipedians doing anti-vandalism work - they inform editors on how particular vandals edit, even when those edits may seem innocent when taken out of context, let them know what to look out for in certain areas of the encyclopedia, and contain suggestions on how to treat certain users; no editor can know about the behaviour of every regular vandal. The records are also used for tracking purposes, informing edit filters for example.

But these pages aren't without their drawbacks. Vandals are often drawn to this system, either by aiming to become an LTA as some kind of badge of honour, trying to live up to their name once listed as an LTA, or by new vandals attempting to emulate the well documented vandalism methods. We should be doing a better job of [[Wikipedia:Deny recognition|denying recognition]] to these vandals, but this is hard to do whilst also keeping a comprehensive open record of their actions on Wikipedia. The other issue with having these records in a public space is not being able to properly document the vandals' edit patterns or our counter measures to avoid [[Wikipedia:BEANS|BEANS]] issues, leaving out information that could be valuable to anti-vandal editors.

''' Proposal '''

We are therefore proposing a new tool for Wikipedians, called the LTA Knowledgebase, which would be an off-wiki database of LTA records, available for viewing and editing to only (probably approved) experienced editors. [[User:Samtar|Samtar]] has been working on this for a little while now, and you can see a proof-of-concept version [[toollabs:lta/publicdemo/|here]]. With this database vandal fighters will be able to both log information on more recurring vandals as well as covering their editing habits and what we're doing in response in more detail (documenting how relevant targeted edit filters work for example). This will be especially beneficial for those LTAs who we don't even document in order to fully deny recognition. LTAs won't know whether they have an entry, nor what that entry contains.

This tool will not be for extra personal information on these users; it will only encourage more behavioural details, and rules will need to be in place for tool admins to remove any personal information that is added. Requirements for access can be debated in another RfC, but the approach would likely be that users would require manual approval from a tool admin with the needed experience level somewhere between that of [[Wikipedia:NPP|NPP]] and [[Wikipedia:Volunteer Response Team|OTRS]], requiring sufficient time and experience working on anti-vandalism work to be trusted. Future RfCs could also decide on criteria for the addition of an LTA to the tool and whether all users are able to add an entry or whether new entries might require approval by a tool admin, for example.

Subsequent discussions can be held to clarify the details and specifics so these needn't be debated here beyond suggestions and initial discussion.

My future on '''Wiki''' has so gravely recently been cast in doubt by such unwarranted blocks as to my alleged previous socketpuppetry and by so many Admins on different wikis, I should imagine that it is now impossible for me to prove my innocence (partially to blame), worthiness, usefulness, eagerness ''etc''? Either way I have been compromised by being associated with my ex-wife's User name & after the WP STANDARD OFFER not much seems to have changed : we still seem to be associated. Could this now cease once & for all, please? (Perhaps, by way of brevity, could you see that some in the Wiki word detection unit might describe such phrases as being standardised English? Jaja!!)

As reported in multiple sources, Mrs. Trump has brought libel suits in the U.S., most recently in New York, concerning allegations originally published in ''[[The Daily Mail]]''. These new developments are not a simple rehash of the original, inflammatory allegations, but rather delve into how Mrs. Trump is protecting her brand. Multiple reliable sources are reporting on this, including ''[[The New York Times]]'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/us/politics/melania-trump-libel-suit-daily-mail.html in this article] and accompanying editorial[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/opinion/melania-trump-inc-imperiled.html].

The questions we need to address is 

1. whether the libel suits should be mentioned 

2. if so, to what extent, if at all, should the original allegations published by the ''Mail'' be mentioned? 

3. Should they be included as a separate section or subsection?

One opinion is that Spencer should ONLY be referred to as a white supremacist because there are numerous media outlets that report him as such ([https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Richard+Spencer%22&oq=%22Ric&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i59.1063j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&tbm=nws&q=%22Richard+Spencer%22+%22white+supremacist%22]). Another is that Spencer is more identifiable as a white nationalist (again, because multiple media outlets report on him as such [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Richard+Spencer%22&oq=%22Ric&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i59.1063j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=%22Richard+Spencer%22+%22white+nationalist%22&safe=off&tbm=nws]), with reference to fact that he is referred to as white supremacist by some other sources. Major issues to consider is that Spencer has repeatedly publically stated that he does NOT identify as a "white supremacist" (this is a [[WP:BLP]] article). Another issue is that some editors claim there is no difference between [[white nationalism]] and [[white supremacy]] so the distinction is meaningless. Looking for alterate opinions.

Many users understand what to do, but some user do not wwish to fufill such request, since another user may have edited the article while the bad content was still there, and that there attribution needs to be kept. The fact is that only the username needs to be attributed, not the diff of the edit. Therefore, I ask for a clearer wording of [[WP:RD1]] as following:

Merge from [[Sothis]] to [[Sirius]] and/or [[Sopdet]]. There are weasel words in its article but Sothis ''is'' (and is universally regarded by {{sc|rs}} as) the star Sirius, as already mentioned and sourced in the article Sirius. It is also ridiculous that the §{{nbsp}}''Cultural significance'' section of the article Sirius currently has a paragraph on Theosophy, two subsections on minor African ethicities, and a Harry Potter shoutout but no discussion of its central importance to ancient Egyptian culture. 

''If'' it is felt important to maintain an entirely separate article on the ancient Egyptian cultural aspects of Sirius, it should occur at the star's ancient Egyptian name (typically reconstructed as [[Sopdet]]) and not at the romanization of the hellenization of that name. The current treatment there of the star as an Egyptian goddess should simply form a subsection of such an article, since she is simply a personification of the star within their culture. In that case, the §{{nbsp}}''Cultural significance'' section of Sirius should still have an overview of the material being forked out and links to it.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User talk:LlywelynII|<span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em; class=texhtml">Llywelyn<font color="Gold">II</font></span>]] 15:10, 8 February 2017 (UTC)}}

[[MOS:DASH]] specifies that two dates with at least one space in them should be separated by a spaced, not unspaced, en dash. However, opinion polling articles have often not complied by MOS:DASH in the past – whether intentionally or simply because [[Opinion polling for the next Turkish general election|users]] [[Opinion polling for the Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2019|aren't]] [[Opinion polling for the next Slovak parliamentary election|aware]] ([[Opinion polling for the next Slovenian parliamentary election|i.e.]], [[Opinion polling for the Norwegian parliamentary election, 2017|that]] [[Opinion polling for the Czech legislative election, 2017|hyphens]] [[Opinion polling for the Czech presidential election, 2018|or]] [[Opinion polling for the next Croatian parliamentary election|em]] [[Opinion polling for the Czech legislative election, 2017|dashes]] shouldn't be used to separate dates).

As of Jan 9, [[Adult-oriented rock]] redirects to [[Album-oriented rock]] even though "adult-oriented rock" doesn't appear in this article. The dispute over including these sentences comes from the fact that "adult-oriented rock" is a loosely defined term, sometimes also referring to [[Arena rock]] or [[Yacht rock]], which are not radio formats. Some sources (cited above) say that the terms are regionally dependent, and that "album-oriented rock" was the format as it was known in the US. Other people claim (without sources) that "album-oriented rock" was the official name of the radio format described in this article, and that "adult-oriented rock" is a meaningless term that ought to denote [[Adult album alternative]] (this notion is also contradicted by music industry textbooks).<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=tdgdAQAAMAAJ&q=%22adult-oriented+rock%22+%22adult+album+alternative%22&dq=%22adult-oriented+rock%22+%22adult+album+alternative%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOxenWs7bRAhWE7yYKHa-lAFoQ6AEIJDAB</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HOaBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA111 ''Understanding the Music Industries'' by Chris Anderton, Andrew Dubber, Martin James]</ref>

The "Today's featured article" (TFA) slot on the main page showcases a different featured article (FA) every day.  FAs are not being produced as fast as the TFA slot uses them.  The number of available featured articles is also reduced by the fact that many older FAs have degraded to the point where they are no longer suitable for TFA.  See [https://tools.wmflabs.org/bambots/cwb/bycat/Featured_articles.html this listing] of FAs marked for cleanup, and the [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Featured log|featured article log]] to see the rate of production of FAs.

A separate issue is the need for variety of subjects in the TFA slot.  Because some productive FA writers have written a large number of FAs in narrow subject areas, it is getting harder to avoid some repetition in the type of articles showcased on the main page.

He later said, "We’ve killed more Muslims than they’ve killed us, by an awful lot. We’ve invaded more Muslim countries than they’ve invaded ours, by an awful lot.

I am proposing that the current text in the section '''[[Wikipedia:User_categories#Inappropriate_types_of_user_categories|Inappropriate types of user categories]]''' regarding joke categories be removed. The text reads:
<div style="border:1px solid black;">
:;Categories which group users on the basis of '''irrelevant likes'''
::This includes any grouping of users on the basis of shared preferences that are irrelevant to encyclopedia-building (e.g. [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/User/Archive/August 2007#Category:Wikipedians who like red foxes|Wikipedians who like red foxes]], [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/User/Archive/September 2006#Wikipedians by diet|Wikipedians by food preference]]).
:...
:;Categories that are '''jokes/nonsense'''
::This includes any grouping of users that are patently false (e.g. [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/User/Archive/June 2007#Category:Wikipedians who are zombies|Wikipedians who are zombies]], [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/User/Archive/July 2007#Category:Wikipedians in their 780s|Wikipedians in their 780s]]), nonsensical (e.g. [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/User/Archive/December 2007#Category:Userpages That Are Full Of LOL|Userpages That Are Full Of LOL]]), undecipherable (e.g. [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/User/Archive/September 2007#Category:Wikipedians who Watch animals from their POV|Wikipedians who Watch animals from their POV]]), or created primarily for humourous or satirical purposes (e.g. [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/User/Archive/April 2007#Category:Wikipedians who are one of an infinite number of monkeys|Wikipedians who are one of an infinite number of monkeys]]).<ref>A list of precedents is available at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/User/Archive/Topical index#Nonsense/joke/humour categories]].</ref><noinclude>
</div>
I am proposing that it be removed from this section and replaced with something '''similar to''' the following, in the section '''[[Wikipedia:User_categories#Appropriate_types_of_user_categories|Appropriate types of user categories]]''':
<div style="border:1px solid black;">

::This includes joke categories, categories pertaining to likes that do not directly address the encyclopedia and other categories not covered in the list of inappropriate categories below. (e.g. [[:Category:Wikipedians who are "out to get you" and/or your garage band]]). This does not include joke or interest categories which are broadly perceived as offensive or which contain offensive language.
</div>
There is also a question of whether or not to organize such categories into a separate master cat to keep them out of the way of other such categories, but that can be discussed once there is a consensus on this question. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml">[[User:MjolnirPants|<font color="green">'''ᛗᛁᛟᛚᚾᛁᚱPants'''</font>]] [[User_talk:MjolnirPants|<small>Tell me all about it.</small>]]</span> 15:10, 17 February 2017 (UTC)}}

The recent RFC on notability of secondary schools[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=767614516#RfC_on_secondary_school_notability] was closed with a finding of 4 keys points, the second of which was that {{tq|WP:SCHOOLOUTCOMES should be added to the Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions, as it is an accurate statement of the results but promotes circular reasoning}}.

Since this principle has been accepted, then why should it be applied only to schools?  Exactly the same problem of circular reasoning applies to use of [[WP:OUTCOMES]] in every other deletion discussion, from astronauts to zoology. The principle is already set out at [[WP:OUTCOMES#Citing_this_page_in_AfD]], but has not been carried through to [[WP:ATA]].

Here is an RfC on the creation of a new user right that along with administrators can close and relist XfD (AfD, CfD, MfD, RfD, and TfD) discussions exclusively. This will eliminate most malformed closures, relists without the discussions not being transferred into the appropriate log, and so on and so forth.

Therefore I am proposing for a creation of a new user right known as 'XfD closer', and have that right automatically granted to users with at least '''at least 50 uncontested closes of XfDs in the past six months, with less then 5% of all closes in the same period being contested''' to this policy being enacted. These users will be allowed to close and relist discussions, but not as 'delete' or 'speedy delete'. Admins will continue to close discussions as normal.

There will be a page for requesting rights at [[WP:RFR|PERM]], and users there will be expected to have at least 1,500 edits—including 50 wikipedia-space edits—a tenure of at least 3 months, as well as demonstrated knowledge of policies and guidelines. XfDs for articles that have been deleted or obvious 'speedy keep's, can be closed by any editor. Feel free to place your opinion below, under the '[[!vote]]' section.

As of recent, there have been conflicting viewpoints here on the accuracy of the content of the accuracy of the article, namely on the Wiretapping Allegations section. As seen above, there have been arguments over this and as of recent edit conflicts over it as well. It is because of this a consensus must be reached here. I'm not an overseer or an arbiter of any sort on this article, I only ask for a consensus and that is all. A consensus on what content should go into the Wiretapping Allegations section as well as what sources should be added and which of them should be removed.

We all want this article to be free of any content that does not fall under [[WP:HONEST]] and I wish to come to a conclusion on this matter. 

If anyone has anything to add, please do so. A consensus will be the best way to move forward with this as always. Cheers. [[User:Keeby101|Kirby]] ([[User talk:Keeby101|talk]]) 13:54, 21 March 2017 (UTC)}}

Should the sentence:"The court ruled that a substantial part of the Serb population fled the RSK as a direct consequence of Operation Storm. The Croatian authorities were aware that the operation would lead to mass displacement and even predicated their military planning on such an exodus, which they considered not only probable, but desirable."  stay in the article? The problem is that this is a direct quote from a primary source and there's a reason why Wikipedia is using secondary sources. 

Furthermore, the sentence "In February 2015, at the conclusion of the Croatia–Serbia genocide case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) dismissed a Serbian lawsuit which alleged that Operation Storm constituted genocide,[220] ruling that Croatia did not have the specific intent to exterminate the country's Serb minority, though it reaffirmed that serious crimes against Serb civilians had taken place.[220][221]" is in clash with the mentioned, following sentence. 

Also, "The court has ruled" is not supported by the referenced source. The court have made no such ruling, but it addressed a claim. Reading the source one can read a response to a claim :"'''At most''', the view might be taken that the Brioni Transcript shows that the leaders of
Croatia envisaged that the military offensive they were preparing would have the effect of causing
the flight of the great majority of the Serb population of the Krajina, that they were satisfied with
that consequence and that, in any case, they would do nothing to prevent it because, on the
contrary, they wished to encourage the departure of the Serb civilians"

The reference source '''(Update: the link is currently dead and does not display any information)''' citation currently displays an excessive amount of text on the article page, which reads:

Encyclopedia Judaica. Retrieved 5 October 2015. Haller's army ("Blue Army"), force of Polish volunteers organized in France during the last year of World War I, responsible for the murder of Jews and anti-Jewish pogroms in Galicia and the Ukraine… Foreign officers and the ties with France kept Haller's forces independent of the official Polish command, a fact exploited by Haller's soldiers (called the "Hallerczycy") for undisciplined and unbridled excesses against Jewish communities in Galicia. Attacks on individual Jews on the streets and highways, murderous pogroms on Jewish settlements, and deliberate provocative acts became commonplace. While these may have been on the initiative of individual soldiers, they were known to their officers, if not openly supported by them. In 1920, during the Polish offensive toward Kiev resulting from the Pilsudski-Petlyura alliance, anti-Jewish pogroms occurred in the region.|}}

This issue came up at the newly-filed [[Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/TrustMeImAIRobot]], which would be a bot run by {{IP|89.28.5.39}}.

Current [[WP:BOTPOL|bot policy]] is that bot operators are "prominently identifiable" on the bot's user page. This is mostly to ensure that [[WP:BOTCOMM]] is followed, and to a lesser extent help the community deal with problematic issues from the bot operator should they arise (and I will note here I have no reason to suspect that IP 89.28.5.39 would be prone to such problematic issues). {{User|TrustMeImAIRobot}} currently identify its operator as {{IP|89.28.5.39}}, so in a strict reading of the policy, one might argue the policy's requirements are met. I'm not sure however, this is is what the community intended to require.

So, regardless of they are currently allowed by current policy, should IPs be allowed to operate bots? <span style="font-variant:small-caps; whitespace:nowrap;">[[User:Headbomb|Headbomb]] {[[User talk:Headbomb|talk]] / [[Special:Contributions/Headbomb|contribs]] / [[WP:PHYS|physics]] / [[WP:WBOOKS|books]]}</span> 16:07, 1 March 2017 (UTC)}}

Looks like a long overdue RfC is needed here. Should the following paragraph be inserted into the lead?

{{quote|Spicer's first official statement as press secretary was criticized for making what became called alternative facts regarding the inauguration's attendance numbers. In his statement, he also claimed that the inauguration was "the most watched ever", but subsequently stated that he was referring not only to live attendees at the ceremony or those watching on TV, but also viewers who watched the inauguration online. However, no conclusive figures are available for online viewers, and so such a claim cannot be substantiated.}}

== [[WP:COSMETICBOT]] update '''

The current policy of [[WP:COSMETICBOT]], while relatively clear in its intent, is currently fairly vague in practice, and short on examples. Several of us (both BAG and non-BAG members) have drafted [[User:Anomie/Sandbox2]] ([[User talk:Anomie/Sandbox2|talk]], see also a [[Wikipedia_talk:Bot_policy/Archive_26#Defining_cosmetic_changes|prior discussion]]) to 1) the motivation for this policy 2) clarify what the terms ''cosmetic'', ''substantial/non-cosmetic'', and ''minor'' edit typically refer to, 3) to clarify under what conditions bots may or may not make such changes 4) how to deal with undesired cosmetic edits.

This RFC is to see if the proposed update/wording has consensus. Refinements can be made during the RFC if issues are found with it. <span style="font-variant:small-caps; whitespace:nowrap;">[[User:Headbomb|Headbomb]] {[[User talk:Headbomb|talk]] / [[Special:Contributions/Headbomb|contribs]] / [[WP:PHYS|physics]] / [[WP:WBOOKS|books]]}</span> 11:46, 26 March 2017 (UTC)}}

For the past three years I have been using Private Internet Access VPN to make myself harder to track on the Internet.  I don't see myself stopping this practice anytime soon.  The only problem is that I can't edit wikipedia while logged into PIA. Most of the IP addresses are hard-blocked.  So, most of the time, I simply don't edit wikipedia at all.   I was hoping that this problem would resolve itself, but it has not.  So here I am, proposing a solution.

Although I understand the need to block anonymous edits and new-account edits on proxy-IPs, I do not understand why this block must be so comprehensive that it prohibits veteran wikipedians like myself from being able to edit while logged in. 

There is a technical solution already available to users in my position.  It is called the [[Wikipedia:IP block exemption]].  IP block exemptions are automatically granted to bots and admins.  Ordinary editors who are impacted through no fault of their own can also be granted IP Block Exemptions -- but only in extraordinary circumstances.  My proposal is that this policy be relaxed.  I also request that exemptions be granted to accounts that:

* have been around for five years and 
* have at least a thousand not-minor edits to their name.  
* Have not been blocked by an admin the last five years. 

Very, very few spammers and sock-puppeteers are willing to create an account, contribute over a thousand (non-minor) edits, and wait five years for IP Block Exemption status just so that they can abuse the exemption status.  But, if there are any, they will lose their exemption..  Keep in mind that this exemption would only apply to accounts that meet the above criteria.--[[User:&#42;Kat*|&#42;Kat*]] ([[User talk:&#42;Kat*|talk]]) 13:14, 26 February 2017 (UTC)}}

'''Background''' Based on the outcome and commentary in these two AfD discussions ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Leslie_Lynch_King,_Sr. ] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Leslie_Lynch_King_Sr. ]) there appears to be a rough consensus that WP:1E does not apply to at least the fathers of US Presidents. As I am reading things this exemption still requires in depth coverage from multiple reliable sources, but effectively sets aside the 1E exception to GNG/ANYBIO for parents (or at least fathers) of US Presidents even if their relationship to their son is their only claim to notability. For clarification I have always accepted that some parents of presidents or other leaders would be notable either for something independent of their child's place in history or because they are part of some sort of hereditary system of government, dynastic rule etc.

'''Question''' How far does this exemption extend?  Does it apply to both parents? Does it apply only to US presidents or does it extend to the parents of other heads of state/government, again assuming there is RS coverage of the subject? The potential extent of this exception to 1E is considerable, and at least one editor in the most recent AfD responded to this question by asserting it should only apply to the parents of US Presidents. I think this is a subject where some clarification is needed in order to head off other potential debates at AfD or elsewhere. -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 15:23, 9 March 2017 (UTC)}}

Currently the first sentence is this:
: ''Bikini Moon is an upcoming 2017 film by Academy-award nominee Milcho Manchevski.''
I don't think ''Academy-award nominee'' is necessary. First off, its ''only'' a nominee-ship. There are other things to tout for Milcho than a failed Academy chance. Second, its from 1994. Isn't there something more relevant that Milcho is known for? I think the first sentence should be
:''Bikini Moon is an upcoming 2017 film directed by [[Milcho Manchevski]].'' 
As this is clear and to the point, without trying to impute some goodness upon the film by virtue of the director being a 1994 Academy Award nominee. I think of it as reverse Poisoning-the-well, attempting to influence how a reader will perceive something, and that is not neutrality, not balanced editing. 
Lastly I appeal to what other things are. Consider [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]] or [[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]. They do not say "created by Award winning director…" even though [[David Lean]] won '''2 Awards''' for best director. If other films don't start off praising the director in the very first sentence, why should Biki  Moon?

I wish to ask Wiki editors whether or not events leading up to 1948 should be mentioned in the section entitled, "Prior to 1948"? That, is there a consensus to add the following paragraph:
:{{bq|Considering the history of violence between Jews and Arabs in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] prior to 1948, Britain decided in 1936 to divide Palestine between the Jews and Arabs. "The commission, under [[William Peel, 1st Earl Peel|Lord Peel]], was appointed on 7 August 1936 to investigate the cause for the outbreak of the Arab rebellion and the way the Articles of the Mandate were being implemented. Between November 1936 and January 1937 the commission studied the situation in the country, and in June 1937 published its recommendation to abolish the Mandate and to divide the country between Arabs and Jews." [Source: ''The Survey of Palestine under the British Mandate: 1920 - 1948'', published by the British Mandate government printing office in Jerusalem in 1946, p. 166] The UN adopted the same position in 1947, with, however, the Arabs rejecting the 1947 proposed UN Partition Plan.[Source...] War soon broke-out, with Egypt sending troops into the country to help secure the country for an Arab state, without any recognition of Israeli sovereignty. At the conclusion of armed conflict, the interim borders were defined (delineated) by the outcome of war, with the Jordanian army taking-up positions within the territories seen by them as the future Arab state, although in scope considerably less than what was originally intended by Great Britain and the UN, since [[Ben-Gurion]] agreed that the paramilitary forces now made into the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] be permitted to take-over the Negev, then occupied by Egyptian troops. In retrospect, lands taken by Jordan in 1948 were officially recognized as the "West Bank" of Jordan in the [[Armistice Agreements 1949|1949 Armistice agreement]], with lands conquered by Israel forming their ''de-facto'' territorial boundary. [Source: Zvi Dror, ''Har’el: Palmach brigade in Jerusalem'', Ha-kibbutz hameuchad Publishers: Benei Barak 2005, p. 273].}}
Perhaps even it may be seen as appropriate to bring down brief extracts from some of the more outstanding points in Arab-Jewish relations at that time, events that happened in Palestine before the general hostilities that broke-out in 1948. Are they important in this article? Should these incidents be addressed briefly, but '''without the use of harsh language''' that tend to denigrate one side or the other?Any advice?Any better suggestions?[[User:Davidbena|Davidbena]] ([[User talk:Davidbena|talk]]) 16:52, 15 March 2017 (UTC)}}

Should the following text be included in the article?:

<blockquote> In February 2017, the Forward reported that while Gorka was active in Hungarian politics, he had "close ties then to Hungarian far-right circles". The Forward also reported that he "has in the past chosen to work with openly racist and anti-Semitic groups and public figures." The Forward found that "Gorka’s involvement with the far right includes co-founding a political party with former prominent members of Jobbik, a political party with a well-known history of anti-Semitism; repeatedly publishing articles in a newspaper known for its anti-Semitic and racist content; and attending events with some of Hungary’s most notorious extreme-right figures." Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt issued a statement calling on Gorka to "make it clear that he disavows the message and outlook of far-right parties such as Jobbik, which has a long history of stoking anti-Semitism in Hungary.”</blockquote>

'''Notification will only be given the first time an administrator is near to being desysopped for inactivity. '''

The purpose of this minor change is to close a loophole that an extreme minority of administrators take advantage of, wherein they are informed of the imminent desysopping and make one or two minor or inconsequential edits in response, and then go inactive again. </div>

I would also very much appreciate it if we didn't get off track here, let's please just stick to discussing this one incremental change as opposed to a larger reform or redo of the entire policy.

{{rfcquote|text=
I'm concerned WP:POV was breached by [[User:‎Xenophrenic]]. His edit https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Efforts_to_impeach_Barack_Obama&oldid=755890148 said "to properly convey speculative nature". [[WP:OR]] is not the job of Wikipedia. I could just as easily edit [[Efforts_to_impeach_George_W._Bush|George Bush's]] to properly convey the section "Invasion of Iraq" as "Bush's stupid misadventures" because speculation is needed there, am I right? Nudge nudge. Knowing what to expect, I will now go through the titles.

First, I would argue that repeating "Impeachment for" a dozen times is good for creating a mocking tone rather than simply covering the subject at hand.

{{Quote|text=Suggestions of impeachment}}

This title is rather trivial as the article is already named "efforts of impeachment". I replaced it with the category of the efforts like was done in [[Efforts_to_impeach_George_W._Bush|George Bush's]] Correct title:

Political views and actions

{{Quote|text=1.1 Impeachment for offering someone a job}}

This is proclaiming Wikipedia has backed the job as legitimate. Correct title:

Legitimacy of a hire 

{{Quote|text=1.2 Impeachment to prevent Obama from doing things}}

This is proclaiming Wikipedia has characterized Obama's actions as simply not being comatose. Correct title:

The President's agenda

{{Quote|text=1.3 No one talking about impeachment to prevent Immigration reform}}

This is proclaiming Wikipedia has backed Obama's Immigration as "reform", AKA the improvement or amendment of what is wrong, not the neutral "policy". Also, it misquoted the senator as saying that the fact that no one spoke yet was a reason to impeach. Correct title:

Immigration policy

{{Quote|text=1.4 Impeachment for "the most egregious cover-up in American history", Benghazi attack}}

This is proclaiming Wikipedia would put scarequotes on someone's claim (scarequotes are when there is no person being quoted). Further, the long title serves to mock the contents of the section. Finally, the topic was a response not an attack. Correct title:

Benghazi attack response 

{{Quote|text=1.5 Impeachment requested by a towhall meeting audience member}}

This is proclaiming Wikipedia believes the words of the audience member were in this case, incomprehensible. Lazy at best. Correct title:

Background check policy

{{Quote|text=1.6 Impeachment for being born outside the United States}}

This is proclaiming Wikipedia is fine with having the long title serve to mock the contents of the section. Correct title:

Birthplace 

{{Quote|text=1.7 Dreaming of impeaching Obama}}

I have to say here that before I noticed there was an article explaining why the congressman dreamed of impeaching Obama, there was a justification for it, being the IRS. [[User:‎Xenophrenic]] decided it was good enough for wikipedia to quote one of the most cherrypicking NYT articles I've ever seen lambasting a congressman for how he felt, but not why he felt it in the same interview. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Efforts_to_impeach_Barack_Obama&oldid=763740080

IRS policy

{{Quote|text=1.8 The impeachment hearing that wasn't}}

This is proclaiming Wikipedia believes the words of the congressman were in this case, incomprehensible. Lazy at best. Correct title:

The President's regard for the constitution 

{{Quote|text=1.9 Impeachment for allowing transgender students to use bathrooms}}

This is proclaiming Wikipedia has A: taken the position that Obama was personally responsible for this legislation and B: Characterized the legislation as impacting only trangender people C: Overly broadly stated it would prevent them from using all bathrooms. Correct title: 

Gender identity legislation passed during the Obama administration

Because of the total revert of my edit and incompetence of [[User:‎Xenophrenic]] I'm calling in the cavalry so this doesn't end up in an edit war.02:43, 31 March 2017 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The list of alumni is currently proposed to be converted into a sortable table. An editor has disagreed with the conversion on the basis that converting it into a table may be more readable in complex situations, but for a secondary school alumni list with simple information it is totally unnecessary. Also stating that in their opinion the use of table restricts access to WP users who use laptops or desktop computers and that people who use mobile phones and other instruments will find it difficult to view due to technical restrictions in WP format. They have also argued that IP users will be discouraged to contribute after its conversion in to a table, as they are not familiar with using computer languages / wiki markup. The counter argument put forward by two other editors is that a table is more accessible means of understanding the information, which is why [[Wikipedia:Featured list criteria|Featured Lists]] are all tabulated/sortable tables not lists, particularly in this case as the list has over 80 entries. Despite the comments there isn't an accessibility issue when using a smart phone or tablet and in fact it is easier to view on these devices. In respect to IP editors there is more than adequate support available on WP for novice editors to assist them in editing pages such as this. 

These views are clearly expressed on the article's talkpage however an impasse has been reached where any changes to the article converting it to a sortable table are reverted by the opposing editor, without further justification.

{{rfcquote|text=
There has been a dispute going on for a little over a month now, and a related edit war which led yesterday to this article getting protected. The dispute is over how much the article should say about the comparisons that Kevin O'Leary, as a candidate for the head of the Conservative Party in Canada, has gotten in the press to [[Donald Trump]], another businessman-turned-TV star-turned-politician. If I can try to summarize in a neutral way: one side says that the similarities between the two men are trivial and superficial, that O'Leary has gotten compared to a lot of other people as well, and that highlighting these comparisons is a kind of slur on O'Leary, since it may give the impression that O'Leary's political views are closer to Trump's than they actually are. The other side, led by me, says that the sheer prevalence of comparisons to Trump in articles about O'Leary from across the political spectrum makes them noteworthy, and that there's no need to worry about false impressions if both the men's similarities and differences are noted. (There's also a side dispute about the grammar in the various proposed wordings, but I think that's less important because that's easier to change.)

You can see the current desired wording of the "fewer comparisons" side [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kevin_O%27Leary&oldid=768273773#Politics here], and of the "more comparisons" side [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kevin_O%27Leary&oldid=768271750#Politics here] (4th paragraph for both).

Hello everyone! Just starting a discussion of the title where we can consolidate our thoughts. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3A2017_dissolution_of_Venezuelan_National_Assembly&type=revision&diff=773096372&oldid=773089244 Like I proposed initially], we should use go the '''constitutional crisis''' route. I have seen '''Venezuelan political crisis of 2017''', but that is too vague and could be confused with the [[Crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela]]. Going the '''dissolution''' route seems like it would be inappropriate because the Venezuelan government cannot even agree on what they did with the National Assembly. Also, since the decision was so temporary, the dissolution route seems weird since it was only "dissolved" for a few days. I also saw the argument of making the title a '''ruling''' or court decision, but we have so many of those on Wikipedia and the title would be too vague and not relative to Venezuela. I'm leaving this here since this seems to be the ideas at the moment and so we can have a more resolute discussion about the title of this article.

Currently, song articles usually one of two infoboxes:

*{{tl|Infobox song}} – for songs not released as singles, for example, those that predate music recording, released as album tracks only, "radio-only/promo" releases, etc.
Both infoboxes share most parameters: Name, Cover, Caption, Artist, Album, Released, Format, Recorded, Studio, Venue, Genre, Length, Label, Writer, Producer, and ISWC.
The main differences are:
*Infobox single – includes a Chronology for Last and Next Single
*Infobox song – includes extra fields for Composer, Lyricist, English title, Language, Written, Published, and an Album track listing (partial or full)

Even though multiple reliable sources call Richard a white supremacist, it is clear that not all of them do. Labeling someone a white supremacist when there is contradicting evidence (such as Richard himself rejecting a white supremacist label) is in my opinion a violation of Wikipedia's [[WP:NOR|no original research]] policy. Even if you disagree, calling him a white supremacist has without a doubt only caused problems. Therefore, I propose that we change the first paragraph to only mention his profession. Such as: "''Richard Bertrand Spencer is an American public speaker and commentator who is the president of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, as well as the Washington Summit Publishers''" or something like that. We could then make a separate paragraph stating that his views have been described as white supremacist, citing all sources used to call him a white supremacist. In my opinion, we shouldn't use people's political views, particularly something as taboo as white supremacy, as someone's main descriptor, especially if they reject the label. Doing that violates the [[WP:NOR|no original research]] policy by taking labels from select sources and using that as a descriptor. Also, saying with absolute certainty "''[Richard] '''is''' a white supremacist''" and saying a few sentences later "''[Richard] has stated that he rejects the label "white supremacist"''" seems contradictory. I'll leave everyone to discuss this issue and hopefully get some consensus before I attempt this compromise. 

I'll tag some involved editors to help:

As has previously been raised at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject International relations/Archive 5#X–Y relations refers to the bilateral relations between X and Y|WT:WPFR]], and others have agreed to at [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Lead section#Interpretation of MOS:BOLDAVOID and implementation in international relations articles|WT:LEAD]], the current widespread practice of beginning [[:Category:Bilateral relations|bilateral relations]] articles with "'''X–Y relations''' refers to bilateral relations between X and Y..." is not in compliance with the Manual of Style, specifically [[WP:BOLDAVOID]]. It was suggested that an RfC be filed in order to determine how best to address the issue; I'm placing it here as the project talk page doesn't appear to see much activity.

The questions here are:
# Is there consensus that the above interpretation of the MOS is correct, i.e. such wording should be avoided and a natural sentence without bold text preferred instead? 
# If there is consensus, how should the current bilateral relations articles be dealt with?

Personally I don't think all instances of the construct need to be corrected at once. If there is consensus, editors should be advised of the fact, and corrections can then be made gradually as interested editors go through the articles. Editors should also be advised to refrain from reverting such changes. --[[User:Paul 012|Paul_012]] ([[User talk:Paul 012|talk]]) 04:00, 8 March 2017 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Harassment is an important issue on Wikipedia that we should be doing more to address. During their efforts working on anti-vandalism administrators are often subject to varying levels of harassment, usually becoming the primary target of blocked editors looking for someone to blame. Sometimes, administrators are harassed to such a degree that they are forced to undergo a [[Wikipedia:Clean start|clean start]]. We currently have no policy for how to handle this; these users are already trusted by the community to use the tools, but cannot publicly link themselves to their old account in order to regain them. While they could undergo a fresh request for adminship (privately disclosing their old account at the time of running), this might (currently) require them to wait another 1-2 years before they can get back to work.

To quote [[User:Newyorkbrad|Newyorkbrad]] from a previous discussion: "Several administrators have been victimized by depraved levels of real-world harassment and trolling of themselves and in some cases members of their families, typically in retaliation for administrator actions they have taken as part of their duties for the benefit of Wikipedia. Many times we lose the editing and administrator services of these victimized editors permanently. When an admin who has been through this is willing to continue adminship under a new username, this should be allowed to occur."

Around ten years ago, [[Wikipedia:Administrators]] had a passage which stated:{{Quote|If you have [[m:Right to vanish|exercised your right to vanish]], and return under a new name, your new name can request administrator access by contacting a [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|bureaucrat]] privately and producing satisfactory evidence of being the same user, provided you did not originally [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano#Return of access levels|request desysopping under controversial circumstances]]. This will not guarantee privacy, however, as new accounts which are granted sysop rights without an RfA tend to attract attention and speculation.}}A couple of major discussions took place regarding this section; [[Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Archive_100#Reinstatement_of_Admin_Rights_After_Their_Right_to_Vanish|WT:RFA#Reinstatement of Admin Rights After Their Right to Vanish]] in 2007 and [[Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Archive_114#Admins_and_the_right_to_vanish|WT:RFA#Admins and the right to vanish]] at the beginning of 2008. The passage was [[Special:Diff/232744692|removed]] by [[User:Naerii|Naerii]] in 2008, without any corresponding discussion or consensus to do so as far as I can tell. Now, [[Wikipedia:Clean_start#Requests_for_adminship|Wikipedia:Clean start]] has some advice regarding running at [[WP:RFA]], but I can't see that any information about re-adminship after a clean start is written in any guidelines or policies.

'''Proposal'''

I propose reinstating a passage similar to that which was previously present in [[Wikipedia:Administrators]] (see above) regarding the re-sysopping of administrators who have undergone a clean start. I'm proposing a different wording, to make the paragraph more succinct and up to date:

{{Quote|If an administrator has [[Wikipedia:Clean start|undergone a clean start]], and returned under a new username, they can request the administrator user right on their new account by contacting a [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|bureaucrat]] privately and producing satisfactory evidence of being the same user, provided they did not originally [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano#Return of access levels|request desysopping under controversial circumstances]].}}

Recently, there have been conflicting viewpoints here on the accuracy of the content of the accuracy of the article, namely on the Wiretapping Allegations section. As seen above, there have been arguments over this on the talk page regarding the accuracy of the content within the article itself with the core part of the arguments being if the section has a neutral point of view or if it has a bias favoring one side. The edit conflicts seem to be related to political viewpoints. The initial edit not only leaves out content from the whole series of events that went down, but it also seems to have cherry-picked sources to back it up. I believe that this is a violation of [[WP:NPV]] and [[WP:HONEST]]. 

It is because of this a consensus must be reached here. I'm not an overseer or an arbiter of any sort on this article, I only ask for a consensus and that is all. A consensus on what content should go into the Wiretapping Allegations section as well as what sources should be added and which of them should be removed.

We all want this article to be free of any content that does not fall under [[WP:HONEST]] and I wish to come to a conclusion on this matter. 

If anyone has anything to add, please do so. A consensus will be the best way to move forward with this as always. Cheers. [[User:Keeby101|Kirby]] ([[User talk:Keeby101|talk]]) 13:54, 21 March 2017 (UTC)}}

I am creating this [[WP:RFC|request for comments]] because it has been [[Talk:Liancourt Rocks/Archive 11|about seven years]] since the last real discussion and international consensus on the name may have changed. To this end, I see three possible outcomes:
#Leave the article at its current title of '''Liancourt Rocks''' (status quo)
#Move the article to a new title of '''Dokdo'''
#Move the article to a new title of '''Takeshima'''
I have no opinion on which option should be chosen. 

To facilitate this discussion, the following rules should be adhered to:
#Please note that [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee/Discretionary sanctions|discretionary sanctions]] apply per [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Liancourt_Rocks#Motion:_Liancourt_Rocks_.28September_2015.29|this Arbcom ruling]]. Please closely adhere to these sanctions.
#If you are expressing an opinion that the article should be moved from the current "Liancourt Rocks" title, please provide multiple, [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] that support the change. Sources will be reviewed closely to make sure they are reliable and not just propaganda for one side or the other.
#The numbered "Suggested Rules of Engagement" at the top of this page will be enforced during the discussion. Please follow them.
This discussion will continue for 30 days from the timestamp of my signature. Thank you for participating and for your cooperation regarding the rules for the discussion. I look forward to seeing what you decide. ···[[User:Nihonjoe|<font color="darkgreen">日本穣</font>]] · <small>[[Special:Contributions/Nihonjoe|<font color="blue">投稿</font>]] · [[User talk:Nihonjoe|Talk to Nihonjoe]] · [[WP:JA|<font color="maroon">Join WP Japan</font>]]!</small> 16:58, 31 March 2017 (UTC)}}

[[File:Self-inflicted cuts (differend states of wound healing) cropped.jpg|thumb|Image under discussion.]]
I am posting this RfC in regards to the image that is used in the self harm section of this article, I don't think it's inclusion is necessary because it adds nothing to the article and everyone knows what cutting is and we don't need the visual. Also the image can be triggering to people who have self-harmed before. However, due to the non-censorship policy, I thought I should get some consensus first before removing it. Thank you for your attention and input on this matter.[[User:ThatGirlTayler|ThatGirlTayler]] ([[User talk:ThatGirlTayler|talk]]) 01:09, 5 April 2017 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
'''Background''': This RfC is about a possible implementation of some suggestions made in earlier RfCs and other threads. It has been suggested that it is desirable to have
*A way to indicate that someone looked at a draft and, although not ready to be moved to the mainspace, the content should be kept; i.e., should be exempted from [[WP:G13|G13]], which essentially is an automatic deletion mechanism for old AfC drafts.
*A way to sort or rate the drafts by subject, notability or potential encyclopedic value.
*Some streamlined deletion mechanisms for non-AfC drafts.

'''Proposal''': I propose we use a template that looks like the following to implement the above objectives:
{{Navbox
| name  = Navbox/doc
| group1 = Draft classifier
| list1  = '''Main''': [[Wikipedia]]. '''Notability''': yes. '''Subject''': Culture. '''G13 applicable''': No.
}}
Usage:
*The template is to be added at the top of a page in the [[WP:Drafts|draftspace]] (not [[Help:Userspace draft|drafts in user pages]]).
*"'''Main'''" is an automatic link to the page of the same name in the mainspace; the link is typically red but this allows a draft to show up in "what links here". If the link is blue, then that would indicate the draft is a fork.
*"'''Notability'''" can be either "unset", "unlikely", "likely" or "yes". The idea is that setting "notability" = "unlikely" is a diplomatic way to tell a draft is hopeless.
*"'''Subject'''" will be filled using a drop-down menu (apparently that's possible?), using the classification in [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Compact]]. Its initial value will be "unset". The field will be used to create an automatic list of drafts by subject.
*"'''G13 applicable'''" is perhaps most controversial. By default, this field will be "yes" if the draft is an AfC draft and "no" otherwise. But we allow the editors to change that setting. In the spirit of "assuming good faith", we ask editors not to indiscriminately change the field to "yes" or "no". Note also that allowing this option represents an ''extension of G13 to non-AfC drafts''.
*There may be further optional fields such as "merge target".

One might find some details about the deployment are missing. This is deliberate; please make suggestion if there is any. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 22:52, 15 March 2017 (UTC)}}

Second: do everyone in here agree with this? Should we support the historical tag?

Third: if those pages become historical, should we remove them from the general [[Portal:Featured content]]? And what about the portals with featured stars?

A discussion has been taking place, and a consensus cannot be reached on whether the MoS should advise against using 'eg' or 'e.g.' and 'ie' or 'i.e.' (and instead to write such things as 'for example' and 'that is'), and allow editors to write both 'etc' and 'etc.' in UK articles, as long as only one is used in an article. Different style guides advise different things, and both are common in UK English. Editors have suggested it is possibly a generational issue, with 'etc' being preferred by younger people. People may find it useful to read the thread on the MoS talk page, as links to some style guides are given, and advantages and disadvantages of applying this change are discussed. --[[User:Sb2001|Sb2001]] ([[User talk:Sb2001|talk]]) 00:31, 18 April 2017 (UTC)}}

Currently we have the sentence "[[Wikipedia:Harassment#Posting_of_personal_information|'''This applies to the personal information of both editors and non-editors.''']]"

I do not see how posting public information found on the Internet about a non editor is "harassment"? This is a routine part of writing Wikipedia. We of course require it to be suitably referenced.

I propose we change this to "This applies specifically to the personal information of editors." Or remove the sentence entirely.

As on many websites, Wikipedia administrators occasionally [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|block]] accounts and IP ranges that are deemed responsible for or related to problematic activity. You may be an innocent victim of [[collateral damage]], whereby a block of some other activity has accidentally caused your account to be unable to edit pages. If your editing access has been blocked by mistake, it will be reactivated very quickly, as soon as you let an administrator know of the problem. The box above gives the information you will need.

;What is a block?
:A [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|block]] is a measure used to protect Wikipedia from possible improper use, or modification in breach of [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|editorial policies]]. Once blocks are over, they become history unless problems recur. Blocks can apply to a user account, an IP, or a range of IPs.

''' Unblock request '''

If you are unjustly affected by this block, please copy-paste the following text to the '''bottom''' of [[{{ns:Special}}:Mytalk|your user talk page]]:

<blockquote><div>
<code>{&#123;unblock|reason=''Your reason here'' &#126;~&#126;~}}</code>
</div></blockquote>

An administrator will show up shortly to review the block once you have added the above template to the bottom of your talk page. Make sure to replace "Your reason here" with your reason for unblocking.

''' Alternative option '''

You will usually get a faster reply by posting the <code>{&#123;unblock|reason=''Your reason here'' ~~&#126;~}}</code> template on your talk page, as described above. If you find that you cannot edit your own talk page, you can submit a request to the [[WP:UTRS|Unblock Ticket Request System]] at the link below for assistance.

Even though requests sent to the Unblock Ticket Request System are viewable only by [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators]] and trusted volunteers, under '''no circumstances''' should you send us your account's password or reveal it to anyone else even if asked to.

This system exists for the purpose of reviewing blocks only—any request to make edits to articles on your behalf will be disregarded. Correspondence containing [[Wikipedia:No legal threats|legal threats]], [[Wikipedia:No personal attacks|personal attacks]] or [[Wikipedia:Civility|rudeness]] are likely to be ignored and may result in the lengthening of pre-existing blocks.

I am proposing to change the block message to what is above in this section. This is for consistency with Autoblock text and to let editors who don't know what to do when they get blocked, to get clear instructions on what they can do. To show your stance, please type '''SUPPORT''', '''NEUTRAL''' or '''OPPOSE'''. You must have been on the wiki for four days and have at least ten main space edits to vote.

As of Jan 9, [[Adult-oriented rock]] redirects to [[Album-oriented rock]] even though "adult-oriented rock" doesn't appear in this article. The dispute over including these sentences comes from the fact that "adult-oriented rock" is a loosely defined term, sometimes also referring to [[Arena rock]] or [[Yacht rock]], which are not radio formats. Some sources (cited above) say that the terms are regionally dependent, and that "album-oriented rock" was the format as it was known in the US. Other people claim (without sources) that "album-oriented rock" was the official name of the radio format described in this article, and that "adult-oriented rock" is a meaningless term that ought to denote [[Adult album alternative]] (this notion is also contradicted by music industry textbooks).<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=tdgdAQAAMAAJ&q=%22adult-oriented+rock%22+%22adult+album+alternative%22&dq=%22adult-oriented+rock%22+%22adult+album+alternative%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOxenWs7bRAhWE7yYKHa-lAFoQ6AEIJDAB</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HOaBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA111 ''Understanding the Music Industries'' by Chris Anderton, Andrew Dubber, Martin James]</ref>

Does the article title "Generation Snowflake" reflect a neutral point of view, or does it tend to promote a stereotype about young people? Would a change to "Snowflake (slang)" or "Snowflake (pejorative)" better reflect a NPOV? Should the article be rescoped to include related uses of "snowflake"?

The current policy of [[WP:COSMETICBOT]], while relatively clear in its intent, is currently fairly vague in practice, and short on examples. Several of us (both BAG and non-BAG members) have drafted [[User:Anomie/Sandbox2]] ([[User talk:Anomie/Sandbox2|talk]], see also a [[Wikipedia_talk:Bot_policy/Archive_26#Defining_cosmetic_changes|prior discussion]]) to 1) the motivation for this policy 2) clarify what the terms ''cosmetic'', ''substantial/non-cosmetic'', and ''minor'' edit typically refer to, 3) to clarify under what conditions bots may or may not make such changes 4) how to deal with undesired cosmetic edits.

This RFC is to see if the proposed update/wording has consensus.

In the process of formatting "[YEAR] in Germany" pages, I have encountered a conundrum: The earlier the year, the more likely you are to run into persons who were born in parts of Germany that are no longer part of Germany, primarily Prussians.

Numerous verses in the Qurʿān enjoin separation and modesty in dress and behavior on women. Sūrah 33:32–33, for example, states: "O ye wives of the Prophet! Ye are not like other women. If ye keep your duty [to Allāh] then be not soft of speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease aspire [to you], but utter customary speech, and stay in your houses. Bedizen not yourselves with the bedizenment of the times of ignorance."

In this case, separating women from male visitors by a curtain, a hijāb, would logically apply only to the Prophet’s wives. [...] In qurānic exegesis (see exegesis of the qurAn: classical and medieval), the circumstances upon which the verse was revealed (asbāb al-nuzūl) indicated that some visitors bothered the Prophet’s wives to the point of sexual harassment. These accretions would dictate a more stringent approach to the separation of the women of the household from men who are not their kin, both for the Prophet’s wives and, by extension, for other Muslim women as well}}</ref>

<big>'''Introduction'''</big>

The Arbitration Committee process is great for disputes among large numbers of editors where there are multiple possible remedies that could occur for a large number of editors. It doesn’t succeed as well for requests to desysop due to the bureaucratic nature, the long timelines, and the lack of community input. It is also not as successful for long term low-level abuse of tools where the admin has lost the trust of the community. I wish to propose a slight change to the current system.

I believe by giving the community a way they can start the process, along with a simplified procedure, that it will improve the system along with the trust of the community in giving people the bit more often.

<big>'''Proposed Community Based De-adminship'''</big>

If there is a consensus for De-adminship of a given administrator by the community at [[WP:Administrators' noticeboard]], then a motion will be made on behalf of the community to the [[WP:Arbitration Committee]] to desysop the admin. It will still be up to the [[WP:Arbitration Committee]] to evaluate the evidence presented at the [[WP:Administrators' noticeboard]] and to evaluate if the administrator failed to act in a manner appropriate for an administrator to the extent of requiring desysop or to get any additional evidence or information needed to make that decision.

Thank you for considering this proposal. -[[User:Obsidi|Obsidi]] ([[User talk:Obsidi|talk]]) 23:15, 27 April 2017 (UTC)}}

This article says, "Scanning optical and electron microscopes, like the confocal microscope and scanning electron microscope, use lenses to focus a spot of light or electrons onto the sample '''then analyze the reflected or transmitted waves.'''"

I changed it to, "Scanning optical and electron microscopes, like the confocal microscope and scanning electron microscope, use lenses to focus a spot of light or electrons onto the sample '''then analyze the signals generated by the beam interacting with the sample.'''"

This contradicts the Wikipedia article on [[Scanning electron microscope]]s (and all reliable sources), which says," The electrons interact with atoms in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography and composition."

Also, the major optical methods work differently, and this is a poor misrepresentation of both [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy]] and [[Near-field scanning optical microscope]], but I haven't gotten near those.

Please discuss, and please provide references.

=== Proposal '''

Speedy deletion criteria [[WP:A7|A7]] and [[WP:A9|A9]] should be removed.

''' Rationale '''

Wikipedia encourages us to [[WP:Don't bite the newbies|don't bite the newbies]]. However, when some new users attempt to create an article, it is tagged for an A7 or A9 deletion within minutes, before they can add appropriate sources. Although some users create an article in [[WP:AFC|draftspace]], where 'A' criteria do not apply, those who publish in articlespace find their submissions deleted in minutes.

A7 and A9 should be removed because:
*Other deletion criteria address urgent concerns. [[WP:G3|G3]] covers hoaxes, [[WP:G11|G11]] covers advertising, [[WP:G12|G12]] covers copyvios, [[WP:CSD|etc]].
*A true discussion of notability should take place at [[WP:AFD|Articles for deletion]]. This gives users time to prove [[WP:GNG|notability]].
*Tagging an article as A7 or A9 can make Wikipedia's promise of "the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit" seem like a lie.
*If an article is an unsourced BLP, it can be [[WP:BLPPROD|PRODed]]. Indeed, it can be [[WP:PROD|PRODed]] even if it isn't a BLP. At least this allows users to add sources, '''then''' contest the PROD.

{{rfcquote|text=
I propose amending the [[WP:BLP|biographies of living persons]] policy to avoid misrepresenting people. I think that there should be a rule prohibiting editors from labeling a person differently than they describe themselves. In other words, we shouldn't say that Caitlyn Jenner is a man even though she describes herself as a woman, we shouldn't say that Richard Spencer is a white supremacist even though he rejects that label, we shouldn't say that Donald Trump is a liberal even though he obviously is not. (Those are all just hypothetical scenarios). Even if sources describe a person differently, I think that their own self-description should outweigh everything else. That way, we can avoid controversy and accusations of defamation ('''NOT a [[WP:NLT|legal threat]]'''). In a nutshell, I think that if someone rejects a certain label, we shouldn't call them by that label on Wikipedia, no matter what. My proposal is flexible and I'm all ears to anyone willing to comment. Let me know what you guys think. <span style="color:blue">'''THE DIAZ'''</span> 00:18, 23 April 2017 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Some pages like [[WT:NJournals]] are tagged only with a banner and nothing else. I think it's pretty reasonable to say that people who link to [[WT:NJournals]] expect to have people be taken to the same place [[Wikipedia talk:Notability (academic journals)]]. [This is true in Wikipedia talk space, just like in any other talk spaces, whether mainspace, category space, etc... This can be confusing to editors, because they are told "comment here", and the page doesn't redirect to the discussion they were meant to be taken.

So I propose that we have a bot with the following logic
*If ''nothing but banners'' is found on [[Talk:Barfoo]]
*''and'' [[Barfoo]] redirects to [[Foobar]]
*Redirect [[Talk:Barfoo]] to [[Talk:Foobar]] (but preserve banners)

Since I posted about this in [[:Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College football/Archive 17#Navigation boxes in coaches articles|a year ago]] (and had posted it at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College Basketball]] as well with the discussion held there by another user's choice), a certain user (Jweiss11) has decided that there is no consensus (which is clearly wrong.) I had posted the discussion at the College Basketball WikiProject an [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College Basketball/Archive 6#Navigation boxes in coaches articles|hour after the College football post]]. That user decided to hold the discussion there. The post read:
<blockquote>''Something needs to be done with navigation boxes like in the [[William McAvoy#External links|William McAvoy]] article. There is simply <u>way</u> too many to not be grouped together. Personally, I'd like to see them grouped like in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_McAvoy&diff=prev&oldid=713085527 this diff]. No color is needed since the coaches are at various schools. I don't care if you want to leave the default name <code>Links to related articles</code> as the title or something like <code>''Name'' coaching positions</code>, etc. [[Robert L. Mathews|This article]] is another example.''</blockquote>

During the discussionUsers had three options: 
# Group the navboxes '''all together''';
# Group the navboxes '''separately''';
# '''do not group''' the navboxes at all; or
# a different option.
Out of the participants (Me, {{ping|Jweiss11|Sphilbrick|Bagumba|Rikster2|UCO2009bluejay|Lizard the Wizard|MisterCake|Jrcla2|Littlekelv}}), the consensus was clear (for those who !voted) – '''group them all together''' (5–1). Jrcla2 expressed he didn't "feel strongly about this but we may as well just lump everything together so keep pages cleaner." Jweiss expressed, and the user who keeps going against consensus, he's in favor of "Leaving all positional navboxes ungrouped and putting all championships, awards, and honors navboxes in one collapsed grouping." Something Rikster2 said – and I happen to agree with – is "I just fail to see why coach tenure navboxes are necessarily more important than others and am tired of the overloaded navboxes of the [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]]'s and [[Mysterious Walker]]'s of the world. At the end of the day, coach tenures should be in the infobox anyway so it isn't like the information is being hidden - it is still available on quick scan." After the consensus, edits were made to reflect it, but Jweiss keeps reverting. I'm tired of it and would like others to jump in to voice their opinions.

{{rfcquote|text=
There was lengthy discussion in 2012/13 regarding a brief posting of a link to a satire site (The Onion) on Congressman Fleming's Facebook page. Though it was never determined whether Fleming or a staff member actually posted the link, it was reported as one of many accidental references to satirical sites by politicians, editors and news anchors. Ultimately it was determined that it was not suitable for the article and has been deleted since then. There has been no further disclosures or incidents, but a single editor has posted it again to the article creating a disagreement as to whether it would improve the article when no new information or incidents have been reported.  I request comment from other editors as to whether the new posting of the same information from 2012 should be re-added to the article.[[User:Tomuchtalk|Tomuchtalk]] ([[User talk:Tomuchtalk|talk]]) 14:57, 1 April 2017 (UTC)}}

An editor has asked for consensus input so I am putting out an RFC. The issue is simply the bolding of the phrase "299792458 metres per second" in the lead paragraph and the accompanying addition of a link in the boldfaced phrase. The concern is violations of [[MOS:BOLD]] and [[MOS:BOLDAVOID]]. (Disclaimer: I realize this is a relatively trivial matter and I am uncertain why the fix is controversial).

There seems to be inconsistency in the way that sponsored names are handled in the lead section of articles. On some articles (including [[Dean Court]] and [[Queen's Club Championships]]) the sponsored name is written in bold. On some other articles (including [[London Eye]] and [[The Boat Race]]) the sponsored name is not in bold.

Should a consistent policy be adopted across English Wikipedia, either:

Haller's army ("Blue Army"), force of Polish volunteers organized in France during the last year of World War I, responsible for the murder of Jews and anti-Jewish pogroms in Galicia and the Ukraine… Foreign officers and the ties with France kept Haller's forces independent of the official Polish command, a fact exploited by Haller's soldiers (called the "Hallerczycy") for undisciplined and unbridled excesses against Jewish communities in Galicia. Attacks on individual Jews on the streets and highways, murderous pogroms on Jewish settlements, and deliberate provocative acts became commonplace. While these may have been on the initiative of individual soldiers, they were known to their officers, if not openly supported by them. In 1920, during the Polish offensive toward Kiev resulting from the Pilsudski-Petlyura alliance, anti-Jewish pogroms occurred in the region.|}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I propose adding the following section to [[MOS:GENDERID]]:
{{divbox|gray|2=People who do not identify as male or female|3=
If neither male nor female pronouns are appropriate for use in a biographical article, including biographies of people falling under the [[genderqueer]] umbrella, avoid the use of pronouns whenever possible. Instead, refer to the person by name if required, e.g. on a biography for a [[non-binary]] person named Chris Doe, avoid {{!xt|They have written many novels and their work has been featured in many publications}} and instead use {{xt|Doe has written many novels and Doe's work has been featured in many publications}}. This makes it easier for readers to follow the article, including both readers who do not accept [[singular they]] and readers who do not accept incorrect pronouns.
}}

[[MOS:GENDERID]] currently does not specify how biographies of people who identify as neither male nor female should be handled. I have seen inconsistencies with the use of pronouns on articles of such people; some use singular they, others avoid the use of pronouns and instead refer to the person by name. I have previously edited the [[Grace Dunham]] and [[Zoë Quinn]] articles, both of whom are people who transitioned from a female identity to a non-binary identity, to avoid the use of pronouns, and was met with [[WP:SILENCE|silent consensus]], indicating that no editor objected to such usage. This proposal avoids the use of pronouns on such articles altogether, which is an appropriate compromise between Wikipedia editors, a demographic affected by [[WP:Systemic bias]] and therefore more exposed to gender issues, and many readers who may still find singular they to be hard to follow and/or consider that to be incorrect grammar. Singular they is commonly used when the gender of a person is unknown, but this is not the case with genderqueer people, and the use of singular they to refer to a specific person may come off as unnatural to far more people.

There is an ongoing discussion here, relating to how to describe the expert opinion on the reasons behind the diaspora esp. about whether the diaspora is a result of forced expulsion.  
The operative sources are as follows:
{{collapse top|Sources}}
*  "in the popular imagination of Jewish history, in contrast to the accounts of historians or official agencies, there is a widespread notion that the Jews from Judea were expelled in antiquity after the destruction of the temple and the "Great Rebellion" (70 and 135 CE, respectively). Even more misleading, there is the widespread, popular belief that this expulsion created the diaspora." ([https://books.google.com/books?id=80j612aFo_4C&pg=PA159&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mj54UYakNJCM4gSK9ICwCQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false 'No Return, No Refuge'' (Howard Adelman, Elazar Barkan, p. 159]))
*"Although the myth of an exile from the Jewish homeland (Palestine) does exist in popular Israeli culture, it is negligible in serious Jewish historical discussions."([https://web.archive.org/web/20090416045211/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/999386.html Israel Bartal, dean of humanities at the Hebrew University])
*"Experts dismiss the popular notion that the Jews were expelled from Palestine in one fell swoop in A.D. 70." ([http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/24/books/24jews.html?pagewanted=2 New York Times])
*""the dispersal of the Jews, even in ancient times, was connected with an array of factors, none of them clearly exilic" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=gg0m24wY_lUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Ten+Lost+Tribes:+A+World+History&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vca7UOzWM_D34QS5mYDgAQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=The%20Ten%20Lost%20Tribes%3A%20A%20World%20History&f=false Israel Yuval, in  ''The Ten Lost Tribes: A World History'' (Zvi Ben-Dor Benite, Oxford University Press 2009] p.17-18))
* "Focus on the consequences of the Temple's destruction, however, overlooks a fact of immense significance: the diaspora had a long history prior to Rome's crushing of Jerusalem. (...) Compulsory dislocation, however, cannot have accounted for more than a fraction of the diaspora", [[Erich S. Gruen]], "Diaspora: Jews Amidst Greeks and Romans", pages 2-3)
*This text is cited in the section to Ilan Ziv: "The majority of Jewish people were already living in the Diaspora before the destruction of the Second Temple, with perhaps as many as a million in Alexandria for example" (I haven't separately verified this last source) 
{{collapse bottom}}

The options are:<br />

*A: The widespread popular belief that there was a sudden expulsion of Jews from Judea/Syria Palaestina that led to the creation of the Diaspora is not accepted by historians''' <br />

*B: However, some scholars argue against the idea that the diaspora is entirely the result of a sudden mass expulsion of Jews from Judea/Syria Palaestina''' <br />

*C: (list the scholars cited) argue that the widespread popular belief that there was a sudden expulsion of Jews from Judea/Syria Palaestina that led to the creation of the Diaspora is not accepted by historians'''.

{{rfcquote|text=
The menstrual cup page states several facts which are not true of menstrual discs. Specifically, the menstrual cup page states that (the following are verbatim quotes as of the time of this posting):

* A menstrual cup is a type of feminine hygiene product which is usually made of '''medical grade silicone''', shaped like a bell and is flexible. [emphasis added]<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup]</ref>
* Manufacturers have different recommendations for when to replace the cups, but in general they can be '''reused for five years or more'''. [emphasis added]<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup]</ref>
* It is '''reusable''' and '''designed to last for up to 10 years'''.  [emphasis added]<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup#Types]</ref> 
* After about 4–12 hours of use (depending on the amount of flow), the cup is removed by '''reaching up to the stem of the cup''' in order to find the base. [emphasis added] <ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup#Use]</ref>
* Menstrual cups '''must be removed before penetrative vaginal sex'''. [emphasis added] <ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup#Use]</ref>
* This is not a quote, but the menstrual cup page uses this graphic to show that this is how a cup is inserted: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Menstrual_cup_inserted.png/220px-Menstrual_cup_inserted.png

This independent, 3rd-party source states the following about menstrual discs: http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/jwh.2009.1929 The source calls Softcup, a menstrual disc brand, a "menstrual cup", which is the biggest point of confusion, but goes on to state the following facts (the following are verbatim quotes from the source):

* The Softcup (Instead, Inc., San Diego, CA) is a simple single-size '''disposable''' over-thecounter (OTC) menstrual cup that compresses to tampon shape to facilitate insertion and '''can be worn during coitus'''. [emphasis added]
* Because the Softcup is aligned along the long axis of the vagina, '''intercourse can take place''' below the cup, avoiding contact with the rim and minimizing risk of displacement. [emphasis added]
* It is composed of a '''proprietary blend of soft biocompatible polymer compounds''' in conformance with the United States Pharmacopoeia XIX Class VI criteria for plastics [emphasis added]
* Once inserted, it opens to an oval shape, '''positioned between the posterior fornix and the notch behind the pubic bone''', covering the cervix. [emphasis added]
*  Removal is accomplished by '''hooking a finger over the rim''' behind the pubic bone. [emphasis added]

The last two facts about insertion and removal contradict the graphic shown on the menstrual cup page on insertion. The graphic in fact shows the menstrual cup sitting in the vaginal canal not the vaginal fornix -- it does not touch the pubic bone at all.

Page 3 of the above source also shows an image of a menstrual disc. The disc does not have a stem like menstrual cups.

:'''Keep'''.  Thank you for notifying me and for linking to the past proposal (which got archived rather than closed).  The disambiguation page is an orphan, as most are;  disambiguation pages should mostly not have inbound links (an exception being from "See also" of other dab pages).  About this and other 2-item disambiguation pages, and where hatnotes between the two articles exist, in my opinion there need not be any link to the disambiguation page from the articles (perhaps that requires a change in bureaucratic policy, i am not sure).  If/when sufficient more items get added to the disambiguation page (and here I have the impression in this case that there exist other Banco de Ponce branches which can be listed in the future possibly) so that hatnotes between the pages become unwieldy, only then does the disambiguation page get linked from any non-disambiguation mainspace article.  There's no cost to readers; they pretty much cannot find their way to the disambiguation page.  However it would be linked from "See also" at, say, "Banco de Pence (disambiguation)" if such existed, and the like.  Keeping the disambiguation page hurts no one and has us further developed.  Its Talk page and edit history keep the record of debates about whether certain items are partial matches or not, and about redlink topics and so on, and about AFDs about the disambiguation page.  If the disambiguation page is deleted there is no gain, and some cost (on a good percentage of the cases) where the disambiguation page is recreated in the future.  If this one happens to be a low traffic topic where few I.P. editors are coming and adding partial matches or redlinks or whatever, great, but the value of keeping the disambiguation page is higher the more churn there has been.  Fight forgetting boring info about what disambiguation is needed, or possibly needed if only something else happens like a redlink being created in context in some article per requirement of [[wp:DABRL]].  Fight churn, which turns off prospective and experienced editors.  Fight against fights to delete stuff for no purpose! --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 05:40, 10 May 2017 (UTC)}}

Just noting this because it seems this user has a clear PoV, is less than a month old.

Political participation does not hold any water in scientific endeavors. How you can expect others to take you seriously when you insert an "Alt right" sidebar, which includes many uneducated (and arguably some illiterate) people, is beyond me.

To suggest that uneducated individuals adoption of a scholarly field in order to bolster their bigoted and uneducated world-views (such as those included in the sidebar the user attempted to insert) is sufficient for an insertion is clearly false.

To suggest that large media exposure, and usage of this exposure to declare a belief in a scholarly field, is sufficient for insertion, is also false.

This user just runs around making scientific articles political on a whim, and unchecked. Something needs to be done. There are some serious scholars who put their career on this field, and while I am no fan of [[Richard Dawkins]], his gushing over [[Ronald Fisher]] here is sufficient to convey the calibre and pedigree of pioneers in the field.
* Just because [[User:PerfectlyIrrational]] doesn't like eugenics, or feels it is "racist" (nothing new here), it does not mean the people who are truly contributors to the field are anything like what he believes eugenics to be (where his belief is clearly wrong).

In this case I do not think scholarly opinions and uneducated opinions are all that different. The main goal remains to improve the "genetic quality of the human population". How do you define quality may be disputed and the suggested methodology may vary, but they are still part of the same field. Eugenics would frankly be a historical footnote if it did not have popular and political support. 

The main problem is the association of a 20th-century movement with the [[alt-right]], a rather vague and ill-defined grouping of right-wing ideologies and their supposed followers. The connections seems very weak to me. Some of these people are self-described monarchists. That does not require us to redefine monarchism as an alt-right idea.

Which sister projects should appear in the search results on enwiki? 

'''Background'''

[[User:CKoerner (WMF)]] announced in [[WP:VPT]] that Cross-wiki Search Results would be released soon: "The release date is expected to be near the end of April 2017 on all Wikipedias." [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)&diff=prev&oldid=774200007] His post has further explanations and useful links to older discussions. The new tool can be easily tested by using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=rainbow&fulltext=1&cirrusUserTesting=recall_sidebar_results&searchToken=44bxhzfezy56uluyig20gnqk1 this] URL and replacing "rainbow" with the search term you want to test (remember to add the underscore for multi-word searches!).

When testing and discussing this further in [[Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)#Sister projects search results]], the possibility was raised to use this selectively on enwiki, by disabling or hiding the search results from some sister projects for all searches. Reasons for this might be that the content returned by some projects is too often irrelevant, problematic, outdated, spammy, or in some other way contradictory to the aims and purposes of enwiki and not really what we want to send our readers to. 

Some examples of common search terms (taken from the 100 most popular articles) with potentially unwanted results:
*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Ox&fulltext=1&cirrusUserTesting=recall_sidebar_results&searchToken=1u398cwonygdeohyxqyec1wtb ox]
*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Rick_and_Morty&fulltext=1&cirrusUserTesting=recall_sidebar_results&searchToken=1u398cwonygdeohyxqyec1wtb Rick and Morty]

*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Charo&fulltext=1&cirrusUserTesting=recall_sidebar_results&searchToken=9ek9r9vwte61y5cib7ir8yls1 Charo]
*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Facebook&fulltext=1&cirrusUserTesting=recall_sidebar_results&searchToken=3fwgsc6epj2jjcpky34qskffz Facebook]

Other searches either gave no results (apart from enwiki) or at first glance no problematic results. Note that at the moment, this search has a serious layout bug when searching for a term which doesn't have an enwiki page, like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Bll&fulltext=1&cirrusUserTesting=recall_sidebar_results&searchToken=3bl5tft7q6drybsrcv68yjcdh this].

IMDb consists of user-generated content, which therefore poses risks that the person is a hoax or has information that is incorrect. IMDb is used as an external link in many articles, including quite a few that use it as an only source. IMDb is certainly not reliable, let alone good to be used as an only source. Those are reasons why I have placed this RfC up. If this gets accepted, then bot [[WT:TW|Twinkle]] and [[WT:PC|Page Curation]] should be notified.

Nevertheless, it seems there is an agenda by some individuals to continue trying to hide this name from Wikipedia.

'''Survey'''

I am requesting feedback on the following question: "Should the article mention the name ''Tuesday Night Massacre'' in the lead section?" -- MC
*'''Mention it''' - The name ''Tuesday Night Massacre'' is widely used by the media and the general public. Whether or not this name is ''fair'' is irrelevant. Its notability is fact and hiding it is introducing deliberate bias. -- MC
*'''Nope, not in the lead section'''.  Your very first source is an opinion piece in the ''Jackson Sun''.  Opinion pieces are mere primary sources per [[WP:OR]], so you need to focus on reliable secondary sources to be persuasive here.  Per [[WP:OTHERNAMES]], "When this title is a name, significant alternative names for the topic should be mentioned in the article...."  The title of the present article is not a name, and therefore significant alternatives need not be mentioned, and surely should not be in bold.  Go ahead and mention this buzzword in the article body if you like.[[User:Anythingyouwant|&#32;Anythingyouwant]] ([[User talk:Anythingyouwant|talk]]) 03:01, 15 May 2017 (UTC)}}

<br>'''Rationale''':--While the supporters of the proposal on a ''per-se'' basis have outvoted the opposers 2:1, the argument raised by the ''opposers'' make good points:--
*There is a valid concern that the results of enabling such a broad-scoped search contains content not suitable for the general audience. 
:But, that the ''multimedia'' search is not included in a ''general search'' seems to somewhat allay the fears.
*It's a fact that there exists  a massive difference between guidelines followed across different sites.For an example--policies dealing with violation of copyrights are quite strong at en.wiki and is strictly enforced but standards and implementation of the same varies widely across sister-wikis.
:No ''satisfiable answer'' has been posed regarding redressal of the above question.
Overall, the staus for implementation of the ''cross-wiki search'' on a per-project basis is as follows:--
*'''Commons'''--[[WP:SNOW|Snow]] '''oppose'''.<small>The lesser said, the better!</small> Primarily due to NSFW content  and fair use images.
*'''Wikibooks'''--Strong consensus to '''oppose'''.Almost every work is seemingly incomplete.A garble of poorly thought out info at best!
*'''Wikinews'''--Near [[WP:SNOW|Snow]] '''oppose'''.Primarily a failed project with heavily outdated content.
*'''Wikiquote'''--Strong consensus to '''support''' inclusion.Still, concerns of copy-vio remain.
*'''Wikisource'''--[[WP:SNOW|Snow]] '''support''' for inclusion.Search-results ought to be improved.
*'''Wikiversity'''--[[WP:SNOW|Snow]] '''oppose'''.Violates core policy of [[WP:OR|no original research]].
*'''Wikivoyage'''--Strong consensus to '''support''' inclusion on conditions of only {{tq|exact title match}}-es appearing on a search.
*'''Wiktionary'''--[[WP:SNOW|Snow]] '''support''' for inclusion.
*'''Wikispecies/Wikidata'''--Clarified by WMF to be not under the purview of the project.

{{User:ClueBot III/DoNotArchiveUntil|1808442053}}
Why is a substub like [[Magdalena Zamolska]] encyclopedic? Because [[WP:NCYCLING]]. I don't agree that participating in some competitions, without winning, or generating any coverage but a mention in the list of participants should suffice. Who decided those and similar exceptions to [[WP:BIO]]? [https://blog.wikimedia.org/2016/01/29/research-newsletter-january-2016/#cite_note-3 Current research] shows that 30-40% of biographies in Wikiepdia are of sportspeople. Most of them are substubs like this, people who did nothing except participate in events. Participation should not be sufficient to be in an encyclopedia; we are turning into a sport stat site. I am hoping the discussion here would be more representative of our community's thoughts than one that could happen at the sports notability talk page (where I'll of course leave a ping). --<sub style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;">[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|<font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;"> reply here</font>]]</sub> 07:55, 18 April 2017 (UTC)}}

Proposing we restore the previous consensus symbol (the 90 or 100px swastika). Or a framed swastika symbol:
<center>[[File:National Socialist swastika (framed in red).svg|90px|26B]] [[File:National Socialist swastika.svg|90px|Nazi Swastika|]]</center>
I call them '''Option 26a''' and '''Option 37-9.''' I don't like the current tiny icon:
*Firstly, its a ''flag'' representation. In terms of simple semiotics, we should use an emblem in this context if possible.
*Secondly, its ridiculously small. I myself can just barely make it out on my work computer. (Maybe I'm getting old, but even if so lets not be ageist on our project ;))
*Thirdly, that was the flag of ''Germany'' between 1933-35. It represents a country first and foremost.
*Ignoring that, its also a flag of the ''German'' Nazi Party. There's plenty other Nazi fistmagnets, both historically and right now.
I started messing around with the image here in ages past, and I'm really sorry for that. I think we should just stop and leave it be. I don't understand what arguments prompted folks to just slap the German flag onto there, but I can't express how weird I find the current state of affairs. Thanks for your time, and again, apologies for opening this up... but this little tiny flag thing just looks terrible to me, as well as objectively inappropriate. <font face="Eras Bold ITC">-- [[User:Director|<span style="color:#353535">Director</span>]] <span style="color:#464646">([[User talk:Director|<span style="color:#464646">talk</span>]])</span></font> 13:15, 10 May 2017 (UTC)}}

There are a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Birthday+Honours&title=Special:Search&fulltext=1&searchToken=azikq1xz971b9agr6ju7g2jgh lots of articles] that are Birthday Honours lists. 

Taking two as examples 100 years apart:
*[[1908 Birthday Honours]]
*[[2008 Birthday Honours]]

;They are  copies of the information contained in the [[London Gazette]]:
*1908:
**{{London Gazette |issue=28151 |startpage=4641 |endpage=4648 |supp=y |date=23 June 1908|ref=none}}
2008:
**{{London Gazette |issue=58729 |date=14 June 2008 |startpage=1 |endpage=28 |supp=1 |ref=none}}
** New Zealand:[http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/0214ea3894106ddbcc257467004d0a83!OpenDocument "The Queen's Birthday Honours 2008"] (11 June 2008) 94 ''[[New Zealand Gazette]] 2561. (used to support a NZ section) 

;Not composite lists:
These lists are different from lists like those of the High Sheriffs eg: [[High Sheriff of Surrey]] that have been created by extracting one line of information from lots of different issues of the London Gazette among other sources, because a Birthday Honours list copy the structure of the Gazette birthday honours list as well as its content.

;Not articles with analysis:
These lists which are laid out nearly identical to the Gazette lists. They are not part of articles where there is an analysis of what is specifically in the list that is different from other similar lists. Eg analysis like this:
{{quote|The first BHL under the New Labour government of 2023 saw a decrease in the number of honours going to members of City firms and an increase in those going to member of the NHS (reliable source). ...
}}  
The [[1920 Birthday Honours]] list/article does not mention the [[Maundy Gregory#Selling honours|selling of honours]] scandal (see [[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925]]), nor does the [[2006 Birthday Honours]] list mention the [[Cash for Honours]] scandal (at the time I am writing this note even in a ''See also'' section).  

;What can be done to improve them?
Given the tone of [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]] and some of its specific comments in it, ought these Birthday Honour Lists (BHLs) be on Wikiepdia, or should the content be moved onto [[Wikisource]]? If they are not to be moved, what can be done to improve them?

In the [[#RfC: Should Infobox single and Infobox song be merged?|last RFC, which ended with a consensus to merge Infobox song and Infobox single]], there was discussion about creating a merged album/track/single infobox ({{Template|Infobox sound recording}}) as a contrast to {{Template|Infobox musical composition}}, which is used for traditional songs and classical pieces.

With regards to the separation of Infobox album and Infobox song, two significant points were raised:
* Singles are not defined as "single songs" — they may consist of multiple tracks, just like an album or EP.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=M.|title=The Music Industries: From Conception to Consumption|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxkjIcNVhG4C|year=2012|isbn=978-1-137-02706-1|quote=As of [2011] a single has become defined as 'a Record containing not more than 4 tracks' where a 'track' is defined as 'a Recording which reproduces 1 Title whose playing time is not less than 2½ minutes when played at its correct speed}}</ref>
* Both infoboxes share most parameters, just like {{Template|Infobox song}} and {{Template|Infobox single}}: Name, Cover, Caption, Artist, Released, Recorded, Studio, Venue, Genre, Length, Label, and Producer.

'''Note:''' This RfC is purely for consolidating the two templates, not removing one in favor of the other. If the elements that are exclusive to Albums (just three or four parameters) were added to the Songs infobox, there would be no perceptible changes, as in, readers wouldn't notice if Album was redirected to Songs. --[[User:Ilovetopaint|Ilovetopaint]] ([[User talk:Ilovetopaint|talk]]) 13:50, 10 May 2017 (UTC)}}

Note that in the case the image is from a press agency or photo agency (e.g., AP, Corbis or Getty Images) and is not itself the subject of critical commentary it is assumed automatically to fail "respect for commercial opportunity".</blockquote>

I'm participating in an AfD for a publishing company right now and there are several keep votes that are based around the company being notable for publishing notable works. Right now, [[WP:CORP]] says no such thing. My belief is that while authors can be notable for their works per [[WP:AUTHOR]], the publishing company should not have that notability. They didn't research the work or write the work. The company merely published the work. [[WP:CORP]] should be changed if I'm wrong.

{{rfcquote|text=
One view is that the [[WP:ANDOR]] guideline is too restrictive because there are some instances where using "and/or" is the better and less cumbersome or less awkward option. Editors have noted that stating "and/or" can be more concise and less awkward than stating "[that], [that], or both," or some more elaborate construction. There is the argument that the guideline beginning with "avoid" is usually interpreted to mean "don't ever" when it comes to applying "and/or," and that this has resulted in an unofficial ban on "and/or" on Wikipedia. It has also been noted that the guideline is sometimes interpreted as applying to quotes as well, despite what [[MOS:QUOTES]] states about not usually tampering with quotes. The other view is that the guideline is fine as is, and that "avoid" doesn't mean "never." This view argues that "and/or" should usually be avoided or is rarely needed. This view argues that most and/or constructions can be easily rewritten. If someone is applying the guideline too strictly, then it's a matter that can be worked out on the article's talk page, or handled at an appropriate forum like [[WP:ANI]]. To resolve the dispute with the guideline, softening the guideline to begin with "Avoid unless," instead of "Avoid," has been proposed. One suggestion has been to change the initial wording to the following wording: "Avoid writing {{xt|and/or}} unless ambiguity would result or unless other constructions would be too lengthy or awkward."   

Do you support or oppose softening the WP:ANDOR guideline? And why? For those viewing this from the RfC page or from an alert on their talk page, see [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#The WP:ANDOR guideline|the initial main discussion above for further detail]]. As noted above, a number of Wikipedia pages will be alerted to this RfC since this RfC affects Wikipedia on a wide-scale level.

I suggest that this template is made consistent in style with the more widely used (and more sober) style of the cite templates. Judging from the comments and discussions referenced above, other people have expressed the same concern.

More specifically, I suggest that the span part of the template be changed to

Topic of this RfC: complete removal of "death of Isadora Duncan (1927)".<br />
Lead section of this article states:


{{quote|This is a list of unusual deaths. This list includes only unique or extremely rare circumstances of death recorded throughout history, noted as being unusual by multiple sources. Note: some of the deaths are mythological or are considered to be unsubstantiated by contemporary researchers. Oxford Dictionaries defines the word "unusual" as "not habitually or commonly occurring or done" and "remarkable or interesting because different from or better than others."}}


A few days ago, I made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_unusual_deaths&diff=779739120 this edit.] Even though not "noted as being unusual by multiple source", there are way too many similar deaths in Indian subcontinent; making Duncan's death usual. Hence, i think it will be appropriate to remove Duncan's death completely from the article. One can see the citations provided there in the diff, and a few examples are provided below (all [[WP:RS]]). 2-3 sources may cause disturbance by graphics : <br />

As a result, I propose that the first three sections are slimmed down, with the bulk of the content merged into [[History of Zionism]] and [[Palestinian nationalism]]. Sections 4 and 5 then remain as they are, and form the core of this article.

Some users have contended that the bar for inclusion is too low and potentially violates [[WP:Notability]]. Let's see where this rfc goes.

Debate has been raging over whether or not the title of this article is adequate for several years now. Most discussants have opposed the status quo in the past, mostly due to a lack of reliable sources supporting it and the fact that it's not the common name for the subject. The trouble is that editors have found it difficult to agree on a better name for this article. I proposed ''Cameron&ndash;Clegg coalition'' above, yet support for it failed to gain much traction. Indeed, the RM itself was mostly ignored until a couple of days ago. Nevertheless, I do believe there is consensus to rename this article, but rename it to what remains an open question. Here are a few alternatives that have been put forth, which all abide by the guidelines set out at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Politics of the United Kingdom/Ministries]]:

The above sentence in the lead was written [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Six-Day_War&diff=prev&oldid=634654862][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Six-Day_War&diff=635019165&oldid=634978950] without discussion at the end of 2014.

It is the single most important topic that scholars have argued about non-stop for 50 years. Yet our sentence shows only one side of the debate. The words "in reaction to" and "preemptive" are the Israeli justification. They should not be written in Wikipedia's neutral voice, and the other side of the debate should be noted in the lead.

For those less familiar with the topic, the other (opposite) scholarly perspective is that Israel had coveted Jerusalem ever since the 1948 war (this is undisputed), that Israeli intelligence knew that Jordan had a military treaty with Egypt and that Egypt's actions were chest beating without an intention to attack Israel, and that Israel took the opportunity to launch a war of conquest while blaming the other side for having started it. This is covered in the article [[Controversies relating to the Six-Day War]].

There was significant discussion of this topic many years ago at [[/Archive 5]] and [[/Archive 9]]. For example, the threads: [[Talk:Six-Day_War/Archive_5#Do_we_need_to_qualify_the_statement_.22Israel_launched_a_pre-emptive_attack.22_in_order_to_conform_to_NPOV.3F|Do we need to qualify the statement "Israel launched a pre-emptive attack" in order to conform to NPOV?]] in July 2010 which had 8 votes to 2 in a debate over whether "preemptive" required a qualifier, and [[Talk:Six-Day_War/Archive_9#recent_revert|recent revert]] in March 2012 on a similar debate.

At least one undisputed and one potential concern with source reliability exist in our article [[W56]] in the last sentence: "One warhead, owing to its use of high performance but high sensitivity PBX nearly experienced a high-explosive detonation with no nuclear yield in 2005 because an unsafe amount of pressure was applied to the non-insensitive high explosive while it was being disassembled.[3]".   More sources of information on the "W56 mishap" exist, one of which refers to the nuclear detonation hazard and to statements made by workers at the plant where W56 mishap happened.  Which of these sources should be used to provide more nearly accurate coverage of this notable mishap, a danger common to all W56 warheads?. Thanks in advance!

The menstrual cup page states several facts which are not true of menstrual discs. Specifically, the menstrual cup page states that (the following are verbatim quotes as of the time of this posting):

* A menstrual cup is a type of feminine hygiene product which is usually made of '''medical grade silicone''', shaped like a bell and is flexible. [emphasis added]<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup]</ref>
* Manufacturers have different recommendations for when to replace the cups, but in general they can be '''reused for five years or more'''. [emphasis added]<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup]</ref>
* It is '''reusable''' and '''designed to last for up to 10 years'''.  [emphasis added]<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup#Types]</ref> 
* After about 4–12 hours of use (depending on the amount of flow), the cup is removed by '''reaching up to the stem of the cup''' in order to find the base. [emphasis added] <ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup#Use]</ref>
* Menstrual cups '''must be removed before penetrative vaginal sex'''. [emphasis added] <ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup#Use]</ref>
* This is not a quote, but the menstrual cup page uses this graphic to show that this is how a cup is inserted: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Menstrual_cup_inserted.png/220px-Menstrual_cup_inserted.png

This independent, 3rd-party source states the following about menstrual discs: http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/jwh.2009.1929 The source calls Softcup, a menstrual disc brand, a "menstrual cup", which is the biggest point of confusion, but goes on to state the following facts (the following are verbatim quotes from the source):

* The Softcup (Instead, Inc., San Diego, CA) is a simple single-size '''disposable''' over-thecounter (OTC) menstrual cup that compresses to tampon shape to facilitate insertion and '''can be worn during coitus'''. [emphasis added]
* Because the Softcup is aligned along the long axis of the vagina, '''intercourse can take place''' below the cup, avoiding contact with the rim and minimizing risk of displacement. [emphasis added]
* It is composed of a '''proprietary blend of soft biocompatible polymer compounds''' in conformance with the United States Pharmacopoeia XIX Class VI criteria for plastics [emphasis added]
* Once inserted, it opens to an oval shape, '''positioned between the posterior fornix and the notch behind the pubic bone''', covering the cervix. [emphasis added]
*  Removal is accomplished by '''hooking a finger over the rim''' behind the pubic bone. [emphasis added]

The last two facts about insertion and removal contradict the graphic shown on the menstrual cup page on insertion. The graphic in fact shows the menstrual cup sitting in the vaginal canal not the vaginal fornix -- it does not touch the pubic bone at all.

Page 3 of the above source also shows an image of a menstrual disc. The disc does not have a stem like menstrual cups.

I have chosen to start this RfC since the previous discussion about it (see [[Talk:2017 Stockholm attack/Archive 1#Pet dog]]) didn't lead to a clear consensus, and is ''"open to interpretation"'', as can be seen in the page history of the article, so to settle it once and for all (unless someone starts a new RfC at some later time...) please state your opinion below. -&nbsp;'''Tom'''&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[User:Thomas.W|Thomas.W]] [[User talk:Thomas.W|'''''<sup><small> talk</small></sup>''''']] 10:29, 24 April 2017 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
In the past, we have kept articles on flying aces simply because they were flying aces. [[:Category:British World War I flying aces]] illustrates perfectly how many articles exist simply for this reason; most of these 481 gentlemen would not qualify for articles for any reason other than their status as an ace. Recently two articles on German airmen have been nominated for deletion on the basis that the criteria on [[WP:SOLDIER]] do not include being an ace: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hugo Broch]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erich Handke]]. The latter is unusual in that he was not a pilot, but a radar operator, a member of a two-man crew of a night fighter. Instead of individual aces being nominated at AfD and separate discussions being had for each, it would obviously be more appropriate if we could have a more general discussion as to whether or not being a flying ace gives one inherent notability, as this has certainly been claimed in the past. So, I pose the question:
:Should holding the status of [[flying ace]] (generally accepted as having five or more aerial victories) be generally considered to give a presumption of notability for the purposes of [[WP:SOLDIER]]? And if so, do the 'back-seat' crew (i.e. those not flying as pilots) in two-man fighter aircraft qualify as aces if they have shared in at least five victories? -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] ([[User talk:Necrothesp|talk]]) 15:33, 24 April 2017 (UTC)}}

In particular, he commented that he was "less impressed by some of the mournful little Brooklyn boys lying there in tears amid the alien corn with nothing worse than a bullet wound in the leg or a fractured arm".[75][76] ''' The passage set off a furor in the United States when the book was published in November 1944. New York City's mayor Fiorello LaGuardia and other New York officials attacked Coward, and the Brooklyn Daily Eagle commenced a campaign against him.[77] There were protests from the New York City Council, which passed a resolution condemning Coward for "the libel published by his reflecting upon the valour and courage of Brooklyn's fighting forces,"[78]''' as well as The New York Times and The Washington Post. '''Due to the controversy,''' the Foreign Office urged Coward not to visit the United States in January 1945. </blockquote>

Based on the discussion at WT:FILM [[WT:FILM#Columns, columns everywhere|here]] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Film&oldid=777160062#Columns.2C_columns_everywhere permalink]), I propose an addition of a "Columns" sub-section under "Non-prose components" to outline best practices when working with columns in film articles. Here is a preliminary write-up:
<blockquote>Columns are commonplace in Wikipedia articles about films, most often for "Cast" and "References" sections. If a single column of references or actors and roles takes up vertical space, it can be converted into multiple columns to use horizontal [[white space (visual arts)|white space]] and reduce vertical space as long as there is a noticeable improvement for readers. However, editors should realize that readers view Wikipedia with different screen widths. Therefore, requiring a list to be broken up into a specific number of columns every time may appear unreadable or difficult to read with some screen widths. Instead of setting a specific number of columns, set an [[em (typography)|em]] value instead, which allows the number of columns presenting a list to change based on the reader's screen width. Please see the template documentation below for further guidance:
*'''References:''' {{tl|Reflist}} (See "Columns" section)
*'''Cast list and other lists:''' {{tl|Div col}} (see "Usage" section and {{para|cols}} and {{para|colwidth}} parameters)
The WikiProject Film community prefers 25em to be used as the default value unless there is a compelling reason to use a different value. Per [[WP:RESOL]], editors need to ensure accessibility for resolutions of 1024 pixels wide and upward. The most popular laptop resolution is 1366x768, and the most popular desktop resolution is 1920x1080. The value of 25em allows for there to be two to four columns for all resolutions between 1024 and 1920.

{{rfcquote|text=
I and other editors have been unable to resolve our differences regarding how to list the nationality of Antonio Margarito (AM).  I hereby request neutral editors to take an objective look at the issue before it devolves into an all-out edit war.  

'''Nature of issue'''

The following facts are undisputed (I believe):
*AM was born in California, USA
*AM was raised in Mexico
*AM has lived the majority of his life in Mexico
*AM has a US passport and citizenship
*AM is listed by [[BoxRec]] and all major boxing governing bodies ([[WBO]], [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], [[IBF]]) as Mexican

The issue is centered around a single source, namely a January 23, 2009 article in the ''LA Times'': "[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/23/sports/sp-margarito-mosley23 It's safer in the ring for Antonio Margarito]".  In this article, it is established that AM has a US passport, but the article repeatedly refers to him as Mexican and states that AM "is 100% Mexican and he'll continue to be 100% Mexican," even after setting up residence in San Diego, California.

'''Statement by {{User|SVTCobra}}'''

{{User|Danggoshdarn}} (and before him {{User|BrendanFrye}}) insist that since AM was born in USA and has a US passport, AM is American and American only, demanding that other editors produce evidence of AM having a Mexican passport and/or citizenship.  AM's listing by governing bodies are deemed unworthy sources for nationality.  [[Dual nationality]] and concepts of [[national identity]] cannot be considered without producing governmental paperwork, in their view.  All efforts to present AM's nationality with any reference to Mexico have been immediately reverted, pending what I consider an unreasonable burden of proof.  AM, by all accounts, considers himself Mexican and so does every source I can find.

A smaller issue, is whether BoxRec is solid enough of a source to presume that AM moved back to Mexico, following his time in San Diego.  BoxRec is normally considered authoritative, but not good enough for Danggoshdarn, who will only recognize the ''LA Times'' article because it specifically talks about AM moving house and no profile or boxing record can supersede this article.

Thank you for your time.  Cheers, --[[User:SVTCobra|SVTCobra]] ([[User talk:SVTCobra|talk]]) 18:37, 28 April 2017 (UTC)}}

Here is a new proposal that would amend the [[WP:MOS|Manual of Style]]'s [[MOS:ENGVAR|National varieties of English]] policy and the format of some articles' titles. While I find nothing prohibiting my proposal, I still seek authorization.

I propose a new way to include any dialect of English in Wikipedia for anything. In other words, we could make certain articles in certain varieties of English and we could note that in the article's title.

For example, [[World War II]] could have two articles, one in American English (using the mdy date format) and one in British English (using the dmy date format). We could note this by making the article's titles look like: ''World War II<sup>US</sup>'' and ''World War II<sup>UK</sup>'' respectively. Searching "''World War II''" would take the user to a dialect selection page that could read:

''For American English, click World War II<sup>US</sup>

For British English, click World War II<sup>UK</sup>

For Canadian English, click World War II<sup>CA</sup>''

We would only need to put the small abbreviation on the title if there was another article with a different dialect of English. We could also put a message on the top of the article saying: "''This article is written in _________ English. For a different dialect, click [[here]].''"

I invite anyone to share their opinion and encourage any editor thinking of opposing my proposal to suggest a way to make it acceptable in their eyes. <span style="color:blue">'''THE DIAZ'''</span> <sup>[[User talk:The Diaz|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/The Diaz|contribs]]</sup> 15:01, 27 May 2017 (UTC)}}

An article published three days ago criticized our coverage of Jesus as follows:[http://www.haaretz.com/life/.premium-1.786100]

<blockquote>One famous and telling example is the history of the Wikipedia page for Jesus: as tensions and disagreements grew between believers and nonbelievers, the article was broken up into a number of new ones, splitting into one page for Jesus and another for Historical Jesus. Instead of addressing the issue at hand, Wikipedia attempts to sidestep it altogether, allowing both sides to enjoy their version of the truth.</blockquote>

I have tried to verify this claim. A [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Historical_Jesus&oldid=19096756 talk page comment] from the late [[Steven Rubenstein]] from 12 years ago summarized it as follows:

<blockquote> Please remember the history: in an attempt to keep the Jesus article NPOV, detailed accounts of a variety of views were added, and the article became too long for many servers. There was a quick consensus to have the article focus on the Christian POV, with sub-articles on other points of view, and very brief summaries with links as subsections of the Jesus article. The main topics spun off were on the historical and cultural context for Jesus, which placed Jesus in the context of what we know about Jewish history and culture; one on the "historicity" of Jesus, meaning, debates over whether or not Jesus actually existed; this article, and I think one or two more on the critical study of the NT and Christology.</blockquote>

I propose we take this criticism seriously and consider whether some restructuring of the various Jesus articles would be appropriate. Things have moved on significantly since 2003-04 when the current structure was created. The suggestion of "Multiple Parallel Narratives" on such a high profile topic is damning to our project.

What referer information should Wikipedia send to an external website when a reader clicks on a link?

'''Limitations:'''
The Wikimedia foundation is not bound by Wikipedia RfCs, so this RfC is purely advisory.
If there is a strong consensus for a particular referrer policy, a request will be made to the Wikimedia foundation to implement that policy. The request will contains the words "if possible" and "as far as is practical" to make it clear that we are saying what we want, not how to accomplish  it.

'''Background:'''

{{cot}}

'''Previous discussions:'''

* [[meta:Research:Wikimedia referrer policy]]
* [[meta:Research talk:Wikimedia referrer policy#Proposal: be a silent referrer]]
* [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 126#Privacy and dark traffic]]

'''Overview:'''

When someone who is reading Wikipedia clicks on an external link their web browser may be given referrer information to be passed on to the external website. Depending on various factors, this information can range from telling the external site exactly what Wikipedia page the reader was on when they clicked on the link, telling them that the link was from Wikipedia but not telling them where on Wikipedia, to telling them nothing at all about the site that the link was on.

For example, consider the case of someone reading the Wikipedia page at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb-making_instructions_on_the_internet#References Bomb-making instructions on the internet#References] who clicks on the link to [https://aardvark.co.nz/pjet/cruise.shtml The Low Cost Cruise Missile: A looming threat?]. (example ignores our recent switch to HTTPS for clarity). 

Depending on how we configure Wikipedia, the aardvark.co.nz website (and anyone monitoring the connection between the user's browser and aardvark.co.nz) could be told that site/page the link was on (the referrer) was:

* en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb-making_instructions_on_the_internet#References (full URL)
* en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb-making_instructions_on_the_internet (page)
* en.wikipedia.org (full domain)
* wikipedia.org (partial domain)
* No referrer information (a silent referrer)

Furthermore, Wikipedia might send additional information that some sites may (or may not) choose to honor in various ways. These are discussed in the technical comments section below.

Many web sites have a legitimate desire to know who links to them. Alas, spammers also desire to know who links to them so that they can refine their spamming. Most users desire to send the minimum amount of information that is consistent with them being able to user the website.
{{cob}}

'''What this RfC is not'''

* This RfC is not binding on anyone. It is purely advisory.
* This RfC is not a discussion of the technical details regarding what is and is not possible using current technology, which may change. It is an RfC about policy, not implementation. There is a section on the bottom for technical discussions such as what HTTPS does and does not allow, etc. All comments that focus on "how we should do it" rather than "what should we do" may be moved to the technical discussion section by any user.  
* This RfC is not about links to other Wikipedia pages or to other projects that are under the control of the Wikimedia foundation. It is assumed that, as far as possible/practical, other WMF sites will receive as much information as they want to receive.

There seems to be inconsistency in the way that sponsored names are handled in the lead section of articles. On some articles (including [[Dean Court]] and [[Queen's Club Championships]]) the sponsored name is written in bold. On some other articles (including [[London Eye]] and [[The Boat Race]]) the sponsored name is not in bold.

Should a consistent policy be adopted across English Wikipedia, either:
# making the sponsored name bold on all articles, or
# requiring that the sponsored name is not written in bold?

A previous RfC was held nearly a year ago at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers/Archive_3#Request_for_Comment], where the consensus was not to put "Racial Hatred" in the motive section of the perpetrator infobox. The major reasons cited was that at the time of writing, sources were not available on the nature of the motive of the perpetrator, and putting in any motive would be considered speculative. Since then, a year has passed, and reliable sources have called it racial hatred, including then president Obama. I therefore propose that we re-introduce the term "racial hatred", supported by the citations given in the lead infobox, in light of the advances that have occured since the last RfC.

This has been a term that has been debated heavily on Wikipedia forever. Whether or not to call them "illegal immigrants" or "undocumented immigrants". I propose that we settle this debate by creating a policy or a guideline that requires all pages to either use the term "illegal alien" or "illegal immigrant" given that this is the term used by the US government. as seen in ''Arizona v. United States''. Federal district court Judge Andrew Hanen of the Southern District of Texas was quoted as saying: ''The Court uses the phrases ‘illegal immigrant’ and ‘illegal alien’ interchangeably…The Court also understands that there is a certain segment of the population that finds the phrase ‘illegal alien’ offensive. The Court uses this term because it is the term used by the Supreme Court in its latest pronouncement pertaining to this area of the law. See Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492 (2012).''

{{rfcquote|text=
There has been debate about whether or not to use the nowrap template on the Big Brother Canada 5 page to keep the voting table consistent (all columns have 2 line breaks instead of 3) Specifically, the edit states "Demetres' choice (br)" which means a line break after "choice", but when the edit is saved, there is a line break after "Demetres'" causing three line breaks. To fix this, I've used the [[Template:Nowrap|nowrap template]] {{tlx|nowrap|Demetres' choice}}, which fixes it from three line breaks back to 2 to be consistent with the entire voting table. However, a specific user has been constantly reverting my edits.  [[User:VietPride10|VietPride10]] ([[User talk:VietPride10|talk]]) 01:18, 7 May 2017 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
 There are a number of statements about inclusion of sports figures that essentially come down to either [[WP:ILIKEIT]] or [[WP:IDONTLIKEIT]], none of which are especially useful in evaluating consensus. These statements were partially or fully discounted in our evaluation.

This RFC discussed two related themes.  The first theme was whether the subject notability guidelines given at [[WP:NSPORT]] are being used and interpreted correctly at AFD.  The second theme was whether some of the subguidelines within WP:NSPORT are too inclusive.  

The first theme developed a strong consensus that the GNG is the controlling guideline, while the criteria at NSPORT are useful tools to try to quickly determine the likelihood of an article meeting the GNG. 

The second theme was the question of whether some of the NSPORTS criteria are too inclusive. Significant discussion only occurred for the cycling criteria.  No consensus emerged on any specific adjustment to the cycling criteria, and no other criteria were discussed in sufficient depth for anything resembling a consensus to emerge. 

The conclusions that can be drawn at this point are:

*There is '''clear consensus''' that no subject-specific notability guideline, including [[WP:NSPORTS|Notability (sports)]] is a replacement for or supercedes the [[WP:GNG|General Notability Guideline]]. Arguments must be more refined than simply citing compliance with a substandard of [[WP:NSPORTS]]  in the context of an Articles for Deletion discussion.
*There is a general unhappiness with the permissiveness of some NSPORTS criteria, but '''no consensus in this discussion''' on any specific changes to any of them.
*There is '''rough consensus''' that sources on older athletes are concentrated in print media. Because it is impossible to prove the negative that the sources do not exist to support an article, some intermediate standard is required for determining when an article on these athletes should be deleted due to lack of notability.

Due to the tangential discussion here on some points that have been raised below, there are issues that remain unsettled by this discussion.  Follow-up discussion should be held to determine (in no particular order):
*The appropriate result for an article at AFD about a sportsperson where they verifiably meet a NSPORTS criterion, but various levels of effort have not yielded significant sourcing (especially for older athletes or athletes from non-Anglophone locations)
*The possible cut-offs for "older" or "non-Anglophone" in connection with the above question
*Proposed specific changes for the criteria in each sports-specific substandard 
As with the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=&oldid=767023947#RfC_on_secondary_school_notability RfC on secondary school notability], this should not be an invitation to {{tq|flood AfD with indiscriminate or excessive nominations}}.

== Labeling illegal (or undocumented) immigrants correctly '''

{{archive top|result=
Consensus is not to have a policy or guideline requiring the use of "illegal alien" or "illegal immigrant".

The terminology should be decided on a case by case basis, and the argument should be about what term reliable sources use to refer to the persons in question and not based on the terms used in law.

And there is a weak auxiliary consensus against using the word "alien".

Cheney held the position for several hours on two occasions: June 29, 2002 and July 21, 2007. It should be noted that never did Cheney actually hold the position of President, he merely assumed the powers and duties of the role while Bush was undergoing surgery. Visnvoisnvo recently added the position in the infobox, noting, "Do not change without discussion. This is an historical event. Check out: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney_Letter_2007-07-21." I have since reverted the changes.

'''Options'''
* A) The position of Acting President is included in the infobox
* B) The position of Acting President is entirely omitted from the infobox
* C) While the position is not displayed along with other political offices, a footnote is included in the infobox which notes he acted as President

{{rfcquote|text=
I'm requesting comment on the first two paragraphs on the [[Baha'i Faith]]. We have had about a month of edit warring, and discussions don't seem to be going anywhere. Here are the first two paragraphs in the current version (which the majority of editors are reverting to):

{{quote|The '''Bahá'í Faith''' ({{lang-fa |بهائی}} ''{{transl|fa|Bahā'i}}'') is a religion teaching the essential worth of all religions, and the unity and equality of all people.{{sfn|Dictionary|2017}} Established by [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in 1863, it initially grew in the [[Middle East]] and now has between 5-7 million adherents, known as '''Bahá'ís''', spread out into most of the world's countries and territories, with the highest concentrations in [[India]] and [[Iran]].{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2002}}

The Bahá'í Faith formed from the [[Bábism|Bábí religion]], a [[19th century]] outgrowth of [[Shia Islam]] that faced persecution by [[Persian Empire|Persian]] authorities. In 1853, Bahá'u'lláh was imprisoned and exiled from his native [[Iran]]. He spent time in [[Baghdad]] before being further exiled, spending over a decade in the prison city of [[Acre, Israel|Akka]] in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] province of Syria, in what is now [[Israel]]. Following Bahá'u'lláh's death in 1892, leadership of the religion fell to his son [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] (1844-1921), and later his great-grandson [[Shoghi Effendi]] (1897-1957). Bahá'ís around the world annually elect local, regional, and national [[Spiritual Assembly|Spiritual Assemblies]] that govern the affairs of the religion, and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the [[Universal House of Justice]], the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bahá'í community, which sits in [[Haifa, Israel]] near the [[shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]].}}

It has been adjusted and improved upon over this time, but there are a few sticking points. Please read the previous section on this talk page: [[Talk:Bahá'í Faith#Edit conflicts in the lead]]. If I may summarize the issues, they focus on how much detail should go into discussing the persecution of early Bábís and an attempted assassination of the Shah by some Bábís in order to briefly explain why Baha'u'llah was imprisoned and exiled from Iran. [[User:A35821361]], in particular, thinks that mentioning persecution and exile should also mention the assassination attempt. Others believe that mentioning the assassination attempt presents its own problematic POV by leading the reader to think Baha'u'llah was behind the attempted murder (he was not). Regardless, all of the information is further below in the article and on sub-pages explaining all the details. This is a question about what is appropriate to summarize in the lead paragraphs to convey important concepts while not going into extraneous detail.

I have been engaged in a discussion with [[user:Music314812813478|Music314812813478]] regarding whether the term "deity" should be applied neutrally to all beings discussed on this page, or whether monotheistic ones should be called by some other name (specifically, "God"). Please see the foregoing discussion "[[Talk:Deity#Nomenclature|Nomenclature]]."

It is my assertion that whether deities are monotheistic or otherwise does not matter, and that a [[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]] requires that they all be given the same appellation on this page. [[user:Music314812813478|Music314812813478]] disagrees, arguing that the term "deity" is not "appropriate." We have not been able to reach a conclusion despite much spillage of virtual ink. I have refrained from re-editing to avoid [[WP:WAR|edit warring]], which I think would probably happen if I did, but have also been unable to persuade [[user:Music314812813478|Music314812813478]].

I am therefore requesting assistance from other parties to review this situation, engage in the discussion, and perhaps raise points that we have not discussed.

Debate has been raging over whether or not the title of this article is adequate for several years now. Most discussants have opposed the status quo in the past, mostly due to a lack of reliable sources supporting it and the fact that it's not the common name for the subject. The trouble is that editors have found it difficult to agree on a better name for this article. I proposed ''Cameron&ndash;Clegg coalition'' above, yet support for it failed to gain much traction. Indeed, the RM itself was mostly ignored until a couple of days ago. Nevertheless, I do believe there is consensus to rename this article, but rename it to what remains an open question. Here are a few alternatives that have been put forth, which all abide by the guidelines set out at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Politics of the United Kingdom/Ministries]]:
