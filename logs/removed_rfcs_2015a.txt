Over eight years ago, I started a little essay on userfication - the process of moving material to user space for any number of reasons. Since then, the content of the page has been expanded and refined by dozens of editors pursuant to numerous discussions, and has been linked from hundreds of pages where userfication has been proposed, debated, or implemented. I think it's time to acknowledge that this page reflects the broad community consensus on how to treat this practice, and call it a guideline. Cheers!

Nancy Lieder is the original promoter of Nibiru and still writes about how it is coming. Should the following observation be in the article to better show the state of mind of Nancy Lieder right before the alleged 2003 doomsday event: '''Roughly a week before the supposed arrival of Planet X, Lieder appeared on KROQ-FM radio in Los Angeles, and advised listeners to put their pets down in anticipation of the event. When asked if she had done so, she replied that she had, and also advised that "A dog makes a good meal".'''

Although I am a technical writer at the company in question, I have updated the article to make it current and accurate. It was languishing in a stale state due to inactivity, probably because of the size of the company and the level of specialization of the software.  Several of the links for references were 404, and the latest functionality of the Objectivity/DB software was not included. 
The article has two issues listed at the top that were added in 2010. I believe those issues were addressed quite some time back, as indicated by the comment above this one. I am hoping for some confirmation that the current article is ready to have the issues removed. Or, if changes to the article are needed first, that would be welcomed as well. <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/12.207.23.2|12.207.23.2]] ([[User talk:12.207.23.2|talk]]) 15:51, 2 December 2014 (UTC)}}

There have been ongoing disagreements regarding the ordering of sections of this article. A prior slightly different RfC was closed as "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Electronic_cigarette/Archive_17#Ordering_of_sections no consensus]". A new discussion but not a RfC was open the next day and after a day of discussion. Might be good to have another formal RfC regarding the ordering of the first three sections.

'''Option 1'''
*Health effects
*Construction
*Usage

'''Option 2'''
*Usage
*Construction
*Health effects

'''Option 3'''
*Usage 
*Health effects
*Construction

'''Positions'''

*'''Option 1''' (second choice is '''Option 3'''). If one does a google search one finds that by far the large majority of the articles discuss the potential health implications primarily. The weight we give within our articles should be similar to the weight given in the literature. Also per [[WP:MEDMOS]] we discuss "health effects" before we discuss construction or chemical composition of medical devices or medications. As e-cigs are a type of [[nicotine replacement therapy]] follow MEDMOS is reasonable.

'''Propose''' support for the use of subsection titles within section "''Present geopolitical entities by level of recognition''" to use text "''Non-UN members...''"

Also '''propose''' support for the presentation of items in sequence of recognition and not in sequence of lack of recognition.

This would present contents as follows:
*UN member states not recognised by at least one UN member
*Non-UN members recognised by at least one UN member
*Non-UN members recognised only by non-UN members
*Non-UN members not recognised by any state

My argument is that we can't speak in Wikipedia's voice to describe a "state" in situations in which that view is not unanimously accepted and may be unanimously rejected.  I also think that, if recognition is a positive and lack of recognition is a negative, then the list should most naturally be presented in that order. 

At present content is presented as follows:

*Non-UN member states not recognised by any state
*Non-UN member states recognised only by non-UN members
*Non-UN member states recognised by at least one UN member
*UN member states not recognised by at least one UN member

The article [[Sovereign state]] begins, "A '''state''' is a nonphysical juridical entity of the international legal system.."  I don't see how we can declare non recognised entities to be states.  We can declare non-UN members to be exactly that.

[[File:Syria and Iraq 2014-onward War map.png|thumb|200px]]
The map image, [[:File:Syria and Iraq 2014-onward War map.png]], is used with the following headings:
* Controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
* Controlled by al-Nusra
* Controlled by other Syrian rebels
* Controlled by Syrian government
* Controlled by Iraqi government
* Controlled by Syrian Kurds
* Controlled by Iraqi Kurds
* Disputed territory ''or'' Occupied by Israel

The proposal here is to remove reference to Israel and the Golan Heights disputed territory from the map as an irrelevance to the topics within which the map is used.

Please respond with '''Support''' or '''Oppose'''

I propose that there is no relevance in the inclusion of Israel in the context of the articles in which the map is used.  Israel are not one of ISIL's military opponents and they are not amongst the nations that have designated it as a terrorist organisation neither have they been a participant in the war in Iraq and Syria in 2014. If Israel do engage in the war then I think a highlighting of Israel would be fair but until then I think inclusion is questionable.  Basically the proposal is that, while there are certainly issues related to the Israeli occupation of regions such as the Golan Heights, these are best covered elsewhere.  I have not seen maps in RS publications make reference to Israel and I think that Wikipedia should follow the same lead.

[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] made several versions of the [[Magnificat (Bach)|same Magnificat]]:
* A version in E-flat major without Christmas additions ([[BWV 243a]], 12 movements)
* A version in E-flat major with Christmas additions ([[BWV 243a]], 12 + 4 movements)
* A version in D major without Christmas additions ([[BWV 243]], same 12 movements as other versions, with minor differences in orchestration etc. – this is the best known version)
I think it is best to treat Bach's Magnificat on one page, [[Magnificat (Bach)]], instead of treating it on two pages ([[BWV 243a]]/[[BWV 243]]) for the obvious overlap when the basic 12 movements of the Magnificat are described.

{{rfcquote|text=
With regard to this drug, every major medical body in the infectious disease arena recommends it for at-risk (vulnerable) people within the first 48 hours.   The consensus of the medical community (WHO, the CDC, the ECDC, the Infectious Disease Society of America, NICE) is very clear  - so far it is unanimous ( I expect one or two stragglers may appear, but what we have is clear medical consensus).  On the other hand, the Cochrane collaboration (and a couple of other groups, some including the lead author of the Cochrane reviews) has put out several meta-analyses saying the drug is ineffective and (since every drug has side effects), is actually more harmful than beneficial.  

[[WP:MEDRS]] currently says: "Wikipedia policies on the neutral point of view and not publishing original research demand that we present any prevailing medical or scientific consensus, which can be found in recent, authoritative review articles, in statements and practice guidelines issued by major professional medical or scientific societies (for example, the European Society of Cardiology or the Infectious Disease Society of America) and governmental and quasi-governmental health authorities (for example, AHRQ, USPSTF, NICE, and WHO), in textbooks, or in some forms of monographs. Although significant-minority views are welcome in Wikipedia, such views must be presented in the context of their acceptance by experts in the field. Additionally, the views of tiny minorities need not be reported."

We recently debated that paragraph of MEDRS [[Wikipedia_talk:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)#Proposed_modification_to_Scientific_Consensus_section_of_MEDRS|here]] (very long debate). 

Definitions:
*a) The "Cochrane position" is that oseltamivir is ineffective and even harmful 
*b) The "medical consensus" position is that the drug is recommended for at-risk patients in the first 48 hours of infection. 
*Note that each is very aware of the other, and rejects the other. 

So the options:
*1) Should we treat the Cochrane position as [[WP:FRINGE]], and remove it from the article, since it is rejected by every major medical body?
*2) Should we treat the Cochrane position as a "significant minority" and mention it, but give it minimal [[WP:WEIGHT]]?
*3) Should we give the Cochrane position equal [[WP:WEIGHT]] to the medical consensus position? 
*4) Should we treat the medical consensus as a "significant minority"  and mention it, but give it minimal [[WP:WEIGHT]]?
*5) Should we treat the medical consensus view as [[WP:FRINGE]], since it is rejected by the most recent meta-analyses?

Before yesterday the Cochrane perspective completely dominated this article. (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oseltamivir&oldid=637060286 this version].)  That is pretty much #4 and almost #5.  As of this posting, it looks like  [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oseltamivir&diff=637164833&oldid=637157331 this], which is kind of #3 but still gives the most space to Cochrane...but also states the medical consensus clearly, so comes a bit closer to 2 in that regard.  The current version is brand new and not stable.

{{User:ClueBot III/DoNotArchiveUntil|1422001845}}
There are two fundamental components of a Wikipedia article:
* '''content page,''' and a
* '''talk page''' for discussion.
This pattern applies to most namespaces. But for a Wikipedia ''template'', there are instead ''three'' (sometimes five) fundamental components:
* '''template code''', which is the actual wikitext and parameters, etc, to be transcluded into any number of articles
* '''template documentation''', which describes the template, why it's needed, how to use it
* '''the talk page''' for discussion
* occasionally, [[Wikipedia:Template sandbox and test cases|'''sandbox''' and '''testcases''' pages]], the location of which I do not object to
Somewhere in the development of this encyclopedia, these three unique components have been squished into space for two components: the code-and-documentation, and the talk page. The template documentation is not given much of any actual accomodation in the Mediawiki software, instead being treated as just another template (a template that in reality will be transcluded into exactly ''one'' page). To accomodate this double function of the Template: namespace, we use lots and lots of nasty include rules: noinclude, onlyinclude, includeonly. This category applies to the host page, ''this'' category to the template itself. Virtually every major template has documentation, but still we don't think it's ubiquitous enough for an implementation more universal than pasting {{T|Documentation}} and include rules on every template page.

'''I want to propose that we automatically transclude /doc subpages.''' That is, make {{T|Documentation}} obsolete: it's used on pretty much every major template anyway, ubiquitous enough that it ''ought'' to be automatic. This would legitimize template documentation and also, I feel, encourage the composition of template documentation.

I don't know anything about Mediawiki on the software level, but implementing this seems like it should be easy enough:
# A knowledgable programmer makes an extension that inserts the contents of the /doc page at the bottom of the template page
# The extension is installed on Wikipedia AND at the same time, the {{T|Documentation}} template is blanked to remove redundancy
# A bot can remove all the calls for {{T|Documentation}} over time; this can be done at a leisurely pace because the calls are now nonfunctional

''' Moving forward '''

I would fancy that this move would occur as part of a larger change in Wikipedia's templates. I believe that the current squished two-namespace system is not the natural one. I believe that it involves unnecessary code, for implementing documentation, categories, and the like. I believe we should move toward a three-namespace solution, or at least some sort of Mediawiki software acknowledgement of a template documentation as something other than just another template. This could greatly simplify the code. Maybe some day, if we plan it right, some of the biggest and best templates, fully documented, with categories transcluded and non-transcluded, could have ''zero'' include rules.

I have pursued this movement in the past, culminating in a Village Pump proposal about a year ago which did not reach a positive consensus: maybe it was too much too soon, and not enough time to develop the idea before sending it out for approval. Here are a few relevant links:
* [[mediazilla:50512]]
* [[mediazilla:51849]] (one I sent in myself)
* [[mediazilla:54140]]
* [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(idea_lab)/Archive_12#Proposal_for_a_Template_Documentation:_namespace]]
* [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/Archive_109#Proposal_for_a_Template_Documentation:_namespace]]

I suggested "Template documentation:" as the name for a new namespace, but not everyone agreed that would be the way to go. Here were a few layouts suggested:

* '''Template:Foo/doc''' (unchanged, ofc)
* '''Template documentation:Foo'''
* '''Documentation:Template:Foo'''
* '''Help:Template:Foo'''
* '''Template code:Foo''' (move the code here; the documentation would remain at Template:Foo)

The single measure I have proposed today (for which I can credit [[User:Anomie]] in the last proposal) would be a single step toward a three-namespace solution, however much discussion is needed as to if or how that solution would be implemented. But still, I believe '''what I have proposed today would be a beneficial move, even if no further changes are made.''' I ask that you vote on whether this single measure would be beneficial or not, and also give your opinion on whether we should start talking about reorganizing the documentation system as a whole.

''' Support (documentation)'''

In the header area of this talk page is inclusion criteria. It currently states:

*Foreign slurs that have become English language [[loanword]]s may be included, as long as the definition and sources are in English.

I propose it be changed to this:

*Non-English slurs may be included, as long as the definition is in English and pertinent parts of the sources are quoted in the original language and translated into English.

I am using an RFC to establish broad consensus for a change to the guidelines for this controversial article. This change will influence other articles as this is the only list of terms type article I could find that has inclusion criteria. Most directly will be [[List of ethnic slurs by ethnicity]] which should contain the same terms sorted.

I would also appreciate commentary on inclusion criteria for [[WP:N|notability]] of the entries. [[User:Richard-of-Earth|Richard-of-Earth]] ([[User talk:Richard-of-Earth|talk]]) 21:42, 9 December 2014 (UTC)}}

I would like to propose that, once an [[WP:AT|article title]] has been chosen in reference to the more reliable amongst the sources available to us and once a topic has been proven to be notable, then there is nothing wrong with many uses of Primary sources.  I'd also propose that in many cases the use of primary sources may even be preferred.  Obviously some primary sources, perhaps being put together by a webmaster or similar, may contain some of the errors that may be generated through the use of secondary or tertiary sources but, in general, a primary source of information will be closer to the source of information.  

The template text currently states: "...'''relies too much on [[WP:verifiability|references]] to [[WP:OR|primary sources]]'''. Please improve this article by adding secondary or tertiary sources."

Here "primary sources" is a link to WP:OR.  How does that figure?  An editor might just be going to a primary source for a basic information that the primary source might be more likely to get correct.  

I would prefer content to read as something like: "...'''relies heavily on [[WP:OR|primary source]] [[WP:verifiability|references]]'''. Please improve this article by validating or correcting its content through an addition of secondary or tertiary sources."  I would also be happy if the entire "primary source references" linked to [[WP:verifiability]].  I think that a different "original research" template should be used on articles with those specific problems.

As per [[Wikipedia_talk:Notice_board_for_Pakistan-related_topics#History_of_modern_and_ancient_day_Pakistan|this discussion]] I am starting this RFC to ask for the rename of this article to [[History of Indian Subcontinent]] or <u>redefine the scope of this article as discussed ahead</u>. The article itself states that it covers the history of the subcontinent and the lede even starts that way. Background for the unaware: Indian subcontinent has historically been known as just India but now the primary topic for the word "India" is the [[Republic of India]] which already has its history article at [[History of the Republic of India]]. See also that the word "[[India]]" redirects to [[Republic of India]] which means there's consensus for that being the primary topic and that standard should be followed so as not to create confusion (an editor got blocked due to this confusion by trying to make a split at another article discussed later although they were also using their IP and account together as sock to get their work to stick). Renaming this article will not only disambiguate and clarify things further for new editors and more importantly for readers, it will also be more neutral towards the current day Indian Subcontinent (a name by which it is still known as) and towards other countries in this region like Pakistan, Bangladesh etc. Once renamed, the current title can either redirect to this article or be split into a new article if needed to specifically talk about the historical region that encompasses the modern India as compared to the formation and independence of India which can be discussed at [[History of the Republic of India]]. A similar split is being made at [[History of Pakistan]] to focus on the region historically and for creating [[History of Islamic Republic of Pakistan]] to cover the history of country's formation and the 60 years till present.. and this is totally per [[WP:MOS]] as the article has grown twice the allowed size and still covering [[WP:DUE]] content just in summaries and is agreed upon by editors from all points of view [[Wikipedia_talk:Notice_board_for_Pakistan-related_topics#History_of_modern_and_ancient_day_Pakistan|here]]. This will also make navigation a lot easier (a template can be created if needed to further enhance navigation) and will also be following the same type of categorization and naming for clarity as covered in scholarly works and textbooks. If this article is mainly covering the history of modern India then moving the details related to the Indian subcontinent and its history to [[Indian subcontinent]] and redefining the scope of this article.
*'''Support''' splitting by renaming to [[History of the Indian Subcontinent]] (or in the same effect move everything related to the subcontinent to [[Indian subcontinent]] and redefine the scope of this article specifically to only the region encompassing India and redirect [[History of Indian Subcontinent]] to [[Indian subcontinent]]) as per my rationale, below suggestion of Bladesmulti, the prior [[Wikipedia_talk:Notice_board_for_Pakistan-related_topics#History_of_modern_and_ancient_day_Pakistan|discussion]] and as nom. --<span style="text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml">[[User:TopGun|<b style="color:#060">lTopGunl</b>]] ([[User talk:TopGun|<b style="color:#000">talk</b>]])</span> 07:32, 11 December 2014 (UTC)}}

The grand jury [[Shooting of Michael Brown#Controversy|Controversy]] section currently* consists of 18 quotes/opinions plus the table. 
* Should we keep quotes, or move to a more prose style summary
** If kept as quotes, should the number of quotes be reduced

 The only sourced content in this article has been removed repeatedly as it contains references apparently not to the liking of a pair of editors. The subject of the Iyanifa or Iyalawo is a controversy in Yorubaland as well as in the diaspora. I believe one of three things should occur: 1) The subject of Iyanifas or Iyalawos be removed entirely to avoid further controversy. 2)The article to be reverted to the version showing both sides of the issue. 3) The aforementioned editors find valid sources to back up their material before making changes.[[User:Lozen8|Lozen8]] ([[User talk:Lozen8|talk]]) 06:28, 11 January 2015 (UTC)}}

I know our articles have to follow the sources, but good God am I disappointed with the news media this time.  They are painting this woman as a ''racist'' because she suggested that a black VIP might appreciate films with some black actors.  Despite the fact that anybody with cable can go in and see a ''channel listing'' with things like "Starz in Black" on it, dedicated to the idea of serving black films to a black audience!  How can cable providers have a full-on ''segregated'' video feed as their routine practice all over the U.S., yet when one woman suggests doing that same thing in a single instance in an email we should never have seen anyway, that's supposed to be a scandal?

Anyway, count this as a request for some sensibility here.  And if you see a sane source somewhere, for the love of God add it! [[User:Wnt|Wnt]] ([[User talk:Wnt|talk]]) 19:55, 12 December 2014 (UTC)}}

The standards for inclusion in this list are not well defined, and in practice exclude many cases that most people would define as "police brutality." The standard should be something like: 1) Cases are cited from unbiased public sources; 2) There should be serious injury to an unarmed citizen by a policeman; 3) The case should be "settled" in the sense that ongoing legal disputes seem to be over; 4) The listing should be fair, listing all important details, such as trial outcomes.

Dispute has been raised above to this naming and I would like raise the question of a suitable NPOV wording that might be used.  Relevant Wikipedia reference may include:
*[[Country]]
*[[Geopolitics]]
*[[Nation state]]
*[[Sovereign state]]
*[[State (polity)]]
I found the title declaring "countries" as being existent even before details were mentioned as presenting extreme and POV and not providing a suitable basis for the development of neutral encyclopaedic content.  I came up with the best title that I could think of but nothing there is set in stone.  It is currently presented as "WikiProject Geopolitical entities not recognised as states".  How should the project best be named?

Currently, Wikipedia has two distinct articles on the topic of [[zombies]]; zombies as related to [[Haitian Voodoo]] and [[Zombie (fictional)]], which covers the standard modern definition of a zombie as created by George Romero. Because the two topics share little in common, there has been no attempt to combine them, as to do so would require a definition that encompassed both while simultaneously excluding other embodied undead such as [[vampires]]. [[User:RedPenOfDoom]] has been attempting to merge the articles into one.

He wants to make [[Zombie (fictional)]] an article about zombies in fiction and [[zombie]] into an article about both voodoo and flesh-eating zombies. However, he has yet to suggest an overarching definition that applies to them both. 

His method of combining them to date has been simply to copy and paste information without context from one article to the other, leaving each article with completely unrelated information that is not mentioned anywhere else in the text. 

He claims to have access to a large number of reliable sources that treat the two together, but has so far refused to offer a definition for a combined topic. <b>[[User:Serendipodous|<font color="#00b">Serendi</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Serendipodous|<sup><font color="#b00">pod</font></sup>]]<font color="#00b">[[User talk: Serendipodous|ous]]</font></b> 21:34, 13 December 2014 (UTC)}}

This article presently states in the "Constitutional role and functions" section the governor-general exercises only certain powers that are the monarch's and his role as representative of the monarch is "limited". The rest of the section consists of selective quotes intended to support that claim. In light of that:

Is the Governor-General of Australia always the representative of the monarch of Australia and exercises the monarch's executive power sometimes because the constitution says only the governor-general may do so and sometimes because the monarch has stipulated (through letters patent) that the governor-general can?

OR

Is the governor-general sometimes the representative of the monarch of Australia and sometimes another, unnamed form of... chief executive (?), sometimes exercising the monarch's share of the executive power as his or her representative and sometimes exercising the remainder of the executive power given specifically to the governor-general in the constitution?

After a short [[Template_talk:Welcome#Should we include the Wikipedia Adventure in this template?|discussion at Template_talk:Welcome]], I think it's time to formally put this forward. While you can see some of my reasoning there, let me also explain it here.

[[WP:TWA|The Wikipedia Adventure]] is an interactive tour designed to help new users learn the basics of editing Wikipedia "in under an hour". Although I have never taken it myself, since I'm a mostly self-learned editor (with the exception of my CVUA course), I gather that many new editors think that the adventure is good. Therefore, I think we should add a link to it in the [[Template:Welcome|Welcome template]]. Assuming that it is used, putting a link to this in such a widely used template will hopefully help new users settle in to Wikipedia faster. What does everyone think?

The names of the municipalities in this template are controversial. I have a proposal how to settle this issue:
#The names of the municipalities in the template should be the same as the titles of corresponding articles;
#If the city/municipality has alternative name that is substantially different from the article title, the alternative name should also be given in the parentheses (for example "Ferizaj (Uroševac)").
The same consensus was previously reached at [[Template talk:Largest cities of Kosovo#Proposal]] for the [[:Template:Largest cities of Kosovo]]. I think that this is the right way to keep consistency within the encyclopedia, but also to help users navigate easily.

Per such guidance as [[MOS:TM]] and [[WP:AT]] (including [[WP:TITLETM]]) and [[MOS:CAPS]] (including [[MOS:CT]]), my understanding is that when we refer to trying to use the "common name" (per [[WP:UCN]]) for an article title, this ''does not'' necessarily refer to using the most common ''stylization'' of the name (e.g., regarding the capitalization of the name or the use of unusual typographical formatting like {{!xt|macy<sup>*</sup>s}}, {{!xt|''skate.''}}, {{!xt|[ yellow tail ]}}, {{!xt|''Se7en''}}, {{!xt|''Alien<sup>3</sup>''}}, {{!xt|Toys Я Us}}, and {{!xt|Invader ZIM}}). In some recent requested move discussions, some editors seem to disagree with that interpretation – saying that using the "common name" refers to using whatever typographical stylization is found most commonly in sources. In a recent discussion at [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Composition titles]], it was suggested (by [[User:Dekimasu|Dekimasu]]) that it may be helpful to have additional clarifying commentary about this here in [[WP:AT]]. The suggestion was editing the fourth paragraph of [[WP:COMMONNAME]] to read:
{{blockquote|{{tq|Although official, scientific, birth, original, or trademarked names are often used for article titles, the term or name most typically used in reliable sources is generally preferred. Other encyclopedias are among the sources that may be helpful in deciding what titles are in an encyclopedic register, as well as what names are most frequently used. ''Note that the preference for common names does not indicate that titles should necessarily be styled as they are found in other sources. For the proper stylization of the common name, please refer to the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]].''}}<br/>(using italics here to highlight the key aspects; we would not need to actually use the italics).}}
Would that be a helpful clarification?

Should criticism of Frans de Waal's bonobos in captivity research be included in the [[Bonobo]] article? And, if so, what type of sources are appropriate for that? [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bonobo&diff=631837303&oldid=631836413 These] are the two versions that are currently debated. As seen in the section immediately above this one (here is the link for those viewing this from the WP:RfC page: [[Talk:Bonobo#Criticism of Frans de Waal's bonobos in captivity research]]), one editor argues that "Wikipedia entries are to be based on science, not journalism. The issue of captivity vs. wild bonobos asks for a systematic comparison, of which there are few, if any. If they do exist, they might be referred to here." Another editor argues that "''[[The New Yorker]]'' is a reputable source; criticism does not have to come from a scientific journal.", and that ''The New Yorker'' source was followed up with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bonobo&diff=631831069&oldid=631830559 an academic source] concerning what appears to be criticism of Frans de Waal not having studied bonobos in the wild, and that this was followed up with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bonobo&diff=631831624&oldid=631831069 Frans de Waals's response to that.] The current version is not only missing that material, but is not supported by a source for part of the material that one of the aforementioned editors (the one pushing the "based on science" argument) left in.

Given the opinion of another editor on the subject being "criticised, vilified and persecuted" for political reasons throughout their career across a range of topics, should that be included as a comment in a different, broader section of the article, given that the claim is of general political attacks, rather than being solely in relation to the topic of this section?

There has been plenty of discussion in the past regarding how to treat the existing "Producers" parameter in situations where there are several (10+) producers credited on a given record. There has been talk of perhaps just listing executive producers in the template for these instances, although some editors expressed concern with issues with older albums where no executive producers were assigned, and instead just featured many general producers. I've been doing some work on ''[[The Pinkprint]]'' recently, and like ''[[I Am Not a Human Being II]]'' (which prompted the original discussion if I remember correctly?), there are so many producers listed it makes the infobox almost too large for comfortable navigation. If it is overwhelming on my large laptop screen, imagine how busy this would look on a mobile device. My suggestion is that an "Executive producers" parameter is introduced to substitute the existing "Producers" field when applicable. If there are executive producers specifically listed on any given album, these individuals would be recognized with the new field, and if not, then all of the general producers would be listed in the original parameter. Neither of these templates would be used alongside each other, and would instead be used one over the other. I would find this particularly helpful with present-day pop and hip hop music; artists usually collaborate with multiple unique producers on each song and when this number is multiplied by at least ten songs per record, it would be much more concise to just list the few executive producers that are usually recognized as the most important, or so the back sleeve of a physical album would suggest. Any thoughts? [[User:WikiRedactor|WikiRedactor]] ([[User talk:WikiRedactor|talk]]) 20:54, 22 December 2014 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
After witnessing what I think is easily described as a one-sided edit war, I have felt I cannot resolve this dispute alone and request comments to help move this page forward without further reverts, hidden comments, and odd edit summaries. For those who are not aware, since 1st May 2014, [[User:Aumbn|Aubmn]] has been an editor of this page. However, in December, Aubmn started having his edits (though in good faith) reverted for various reasons. Some reverts were for [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marie_Antoinette&diff=636469934&oldid=636467599 unsourced material], some for [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marie_Antoinette&diff=636482153&oldid=636480000 copyright] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marie_Antoinette&diff=637052529&oldid=637049366 violations]. It was that third revert where [[User:NebY|NebY]] became involved in this dispute. Aubmn apologised for his violation of the rules and said "didn t know all the rules, my future contributions would respect them fully". 

It was then at the end of last month, between 28 December, and 6 January, that Aubmn added over 21,000 bytes of text to the article (This is shown in the revision history). Then, on 17 January, [[User:Krobison13|Krobison]] became involved. He began to edit what Aubmn had created; he called one of the paragraphs a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marie_Antoinette&diff=642955955&oldid=642955496 "royal mess"]. Around 4,000 bytes was deleted from the article at this time. Aubmn then made another few edits after Krobison, reverting one of Krobison's edits and Aubmn said Krobison had "Removed essential informations about the political and constitutional periods of the French Revolution without replacing them" whilst reverting his edit. NebY then became involved again, reverting all of Aubmn's edits that had occurred on 17 January, stating Aubmn had violated WP:NPOV and that Aubmn's additions "did not constitute encyclopedic information". Aubmn then reverted NebY's revert (again, see revision history), and said in his edit summaries that "Some of the informations considered judgmental could be removed or changed after consultations but removing informations about the leaders of the revolutions ,religion, constitutional process and political activity totally destroy the balance of the art" and Aubmn was "Removing a lot of the informations considered judgmental for consensus while keeping the main political, religious, constitutional events which were totally missed from this article before". 

It was then on 19 January that I became involved and witnessed the dispute occurring between Aubmn and Krobison. Krobison's edits varied in purpose in this period but can be seen in the revision history, between 01:35 to 16:50 on 19 January, with some edits by Aubmn intermittently. Aubmn, after Krobison stopped editing, reverted one of his edits and commented in his edit summary "Please don 't remove essential informations, a lot of your ideas were taken into consideration, the conflict between Lafayette and Mirabeau and its relation to the queen situation is very important". The next three hours were an indescribable mess of edits and reverts between Aubmn, Krobison, and NebY. If I had to put it into words I think the nearest term on Wikipedia is an edit war, though I am reluctant to use such a term. 

After seeing the events unfold, I discussed them with the editors on this talk page, [[User talk:Krobison13#Marie Antoinette|Krobison's talk page]], [[User talk:Aubmn#Marie Antoinette|Aubmn's talk page]], and [[User talk:NebY#Marie Antoinette|NebY's talk page]]. Because Krobison had admitted to not being an expert on Marie Antoinette, Aubmn appeared to me to disregard many edits made by Krobison because of that, stating in one edit summary "Remove vandalism by editor who acknowledge he know so little about subject ,negative attitude no communication after NepY negative involvement ,to be reported to administrator". NebY at this point had made about 2 or 3 reverts of Aubmn's work so I could understand, though not condone, Aubmn's statements. I commented that I didn't think Aubmn's edits were neutral, and included weasel and peacock vocabulary. I asked if he would be okay with me reverting his edits, which I then did with his agreement on that same day. 

However, then for the next few hours, until the early hours of 20 January, both editors began to edit the article in the same areas, and I cannot even comment on how many edit conflicts they must have encountered in this period. I ask that you take a look at the revision history to see this. Then, at 00:17 and 00:18, Aubmn reverted two of Krobison's edits. These were now Aubmn's 4th and 5th reverts of Krobison's work, a clear violation of the 3 revert rule. I then again became involved, asking on this talk page and on Aubmn's talk page, for Aubmn to take a day or two off editing and return with a clear head. NebY later agreed with me that he should take a break. Aubmn was justifying his reverts by stating that Krobison had admitted his lack of knowledge on the article's topic. NebY and I reminded him that the problem was not the content of the article in any way at this point, but that he was reverting edits without discussion or consensus. There was an argument ongoing within hidden text in the article, which can be seen in the revision history. Further discussions between the two editors were had on Krobison's talk page, with Krobison stating "The quality of the article would go up if you would edit my changes, rather than simply reverting them complete with prior errors." I believe this is one of the most sensible comments of the past few days on this issue.

Further edits have been made today, NebY made his third revert of Aubmn's work, for the same reason of violation of WP:NPOV and the use of peacock and weasel words. I won't even comment on the rest of the edits, I ask that any other editors simply look at the revision history for themselves. I have tried here to compile what has happened, and ask for the assistance of other editors in solving this dispute.

There has frequently been discussion about making some of the administrator tools available to a lot more editors, and [[User:Jackmcbarn]] presented a great idea at [[Wikipedia:Village pump (idea lab)/Archive 15#New "vandal stopper" user group]]. The proposed vandal fighter user right would have the following rights:
*Blocks:
**Can block unconfirmed accounts for a maximum of 48 hours
**Can soft-block IP addresses for a maximum of 48 hours
**Can unblock users blocked by other vandal fighters
**Can '''NOT''' unblock users blocked by administrators
*Page protection:
**Can semi-protect a page for a maximum of 48 hours
**Can Pending Changes 1 protect a page for a maximum of 48 hours
**Can unprotect pages that were protected by other vandal fighters
**Can '''NOT''' unprotect pages that were protected by administrators
*Notes:
**All vandal fighters would also be granted Pending Change reviewer status
**All vandal fighter actions will be viewable on one or more special pages
**An administrator can turn a vandal-fighter action into an administrator action, which would prevent other vandal-fighters from removing it.
*Requirements:
**Vandal fighter rights would be granted by administrators after requests at [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions]]
**Rights would only be granted to user who meet the requirements of both roll back and pending changes reviewer
**Vandal fighter rights must only be used for obvious spam and vandalism. Anything else will be considered abuse of the tool and the right will be revoked.

I think that there is a big and confusing overlap in the information in this template between insurgency groups and Militia groups.  Editors on Wikipedia I think have fairly argued that insurgent is now a less used than terms like militia and I think that there may be an argument to drop the title insurgent all together.  I think that it is also of note that Islamist is a more commonly used term for many of the groups involved than jihadist and perhaps this could be used.

'''Propose''' placing all the "insurgents" contents into a unified militia section which could be listed as either "insurgents, militias and others" or just "militias and others" or "militias" or something else.  Perhaps a third column of information could be added for each sectarian category as necessary.  I would suggest that a division for "Sunni militias" could be presented as either "Pro-government" and "Against government" or by similar wording.

As far as I have seen the war constitutes a conflict in [[Sunni-Shia relations]] which has a major overlap as a pro/anti government civil war.  I don't think that a distinction between insurgents and militias, if such a thing exists, is helpful.

I have recently placed the insurgent and militia contents together to aide more easy comparison.

I'm starting a new section with an RfC because it seems like no one really cares to respond to anything on this talk page. As I said above, VEVO channels are not maintained (and perhaps not even monitored) by the artists who are in their videos. These channels do not have a defined personality since they are run by companies. Furthermore, artists with videos on VEVO channels don't fit into the youtube community as the others in the list do. Since this page is meant to be a list of youtube personalities, shouldn't the "by subscribers" section be free of non-personality channels?

I see this somewhat often on AfD. A nominator will bring up an article for deletion, but suggest redirecting to a target instead of plain deleting. Sometimes it is speedy kept per SK&nbsp;(1) if there are no delete !votes, sometimes it runs full term. Currently, the only option (that I am aware of) for redirecting an existing article is to do it yourself [[WP:BOLD|BOLD]]ly. This can be awkward when it is an established page with lots of editors and redirecting would be contentious, and it seems like there should be a venue for discussing these scenarios. SK&nbsp;(1) seems like an overly technical reason to shut down an AfD whose only fault was suggesting redirection, but there isn't a venue to do so. What I really want is just a consensus: Should SK&nbsp;(1) be refined to exclude nominators seeking a redirect? <code><span style="font-family: consolas;font-weight: bold">[[User:Deadbeef|<span style="color:#090;">Dea</span>]][[User Talk:Deadbeef|<span style="color:#000">db</span>]][[Special:Contributions/Deadbeef|<span style="color:#090">eef</span>]]</span></code> 03:06, 27 December 2014 (UTC)}}

In the section [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation#Is there a primary topic?]], should the following sentence be added somewhere? <blockquote>Articles with titles that contain a disambiguation in parentheses should ''never'' be considered a primary topic for its term. For example, if more than one article can be referred to as [[Foo (film)]] and none of the articles are considered the primary topic that can be at the base title without disambiguation, then all of these titles ''must'' have additional disambiguation in their disambiguators (such as [[Foo (1976 film)]] and [[Foo (2010 film)]]), and the title without additional disambiguation ([[Foo (film]]) should become a redirect to its applicable disambiguation page ([[Foo (bad link)|Foo]] or [[Foo (bad link)|Foo (disambiguation)]], depending if a primary topic has been established for the base name).</blockquote> (I've made this an RfC since adding this statement to the page restricts the designation of a primary topic solely to article titles without disambiguators.)

Re: exogenous money theory vs endogenous money theory. When considering which theory to present most prominently on the main page we could possible have two methods:

1. Wiki editors sample assorted literature and see which appears most common.

<strike>2. We could find reliable sources which actually discuss both theories and say which one is correct / most accepted.</strike>

2. We could find reliable sources which actually discuss both theories and where, that source itself, states which one of those theories is correct / most accepted.

Up until now it appears that method one has been employed. But this appears to be original research, which I thought wiki was keen to avoid where possible. In this case I think it is not necessary for wiki editors to rely on original research because there are [http://www.fractionalreserves.com/refs.htm multiple reliable sources] which discuss both theories which AFAIK all come down in favour of endogenous money. For example: former Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada William White said "Some decades ago, the academic literature would have emphasised the importance of the reserves supplied by the central bank to the banking system, and the implications (via the money multiplier) for the growth of money and credit. Today, it is more broadly understood that '''no industrial country conducts policy in this way''' under normal circumstances." [33] (emphasis mine). So currently, on the main page, a method of controlling the money supply is presented as "the mainstream view" when in fact, nobody is using it.

Earlier today [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enid_Blyton&diff=prev&oldid=644150171 I removed what I think are oxford commas] from an article that otherwise eschews their usage. Per [[MOS:SERIAL]]: "Editors may use either convention so long as each article is internally consistent". {{u|Sagaciousphil}} has [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enid_Blyton&diff=644150453&oldid=644150171 reverted my edit]. So I just wanted to get some clarification on this. For example:

* {{xt|There have also been several adaptations of her books for stage, screen and television.}}
:: The last sentence in the lead avoids the serial comma that might be placed before ''and television'', so why would we include it here:

* {{!xt|She wrote on a wide range of topics including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery stories and biblical narratives, and is best remembered today for her Noddy, Famous Five, and Secret Seven series.}} before ''and Secret Seven series''?

{{rfcquote|text=
I started this RfC, and the subject line says it all.  My argument is in favor, and is as follows: this is one of the most important, diverse countries in the world, and one of the most controversial in nature and history.  You cannot simply lock it because of the actions of a few spammers several years ago.  That is simply censorship, and a form not befitting Wikipedia.  In its current form this article is completely inadequate.  The length of the Wikipedia article on Papua New Guinea is roughly 7200 words long; by my count the total word count for Indonesia comes to 6,386.  That is simply horseshit by modern standards of Wikipedia.  As the article thankfully says, there are 300 ethnic groups, speaking more than 700 distinct, living languages in Indonesia.  It is an archipelago of more than 18,000 islands.  I calculate that at 1/3 of a word for each island.  Disgusting.  Granted only about 6,000 are inhabited, and only about 1,000 permanently so, but as far as I know that's still way more than any other country in the world.
:I realize that there is also a separate article on Indonesian history.  Let me point out that there is also a separate article on U.S. History.  The part of the "History" section within the the main U.S. article, which spans only the time since European contact, is ~2,700 words long.  The entire "History" section of the "Indonesia" article is only 913 words long.  The part of that section which spans 2,700 years of well-recorded history in Indonesia contains only 672 words, vs. the ~400 year history of the post-European-contact-U.S.A.  And incidentally, the English is terrible, and contains a HUGE mistake, substituting Sukarno for Suharto.  It also makes no real mention of the slaughter of 1965-1966, or of the CIA (who likely backed and triggered the slaughter) report calling it "one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century, along with the Soviet purges of the 1930s, the Nazi mass murders during the Second World War, and the Maoist bloodbath of the early 1950s" (see Wikipedia article on Indonesian killings of 1965–66).  The pre-history of Indonesia is quite a bit longer than the U.S. prehistory as well, but is about the same number of words, and makes no mention of Homo floresiensis.  There is no mention of the genocide-like travesties committed in Timor Timur (Timor-Leste) and New Guinea, facts already mentioned by two different users on this talk page, but subsequently ignored.  
While there a mention and link to the Wallace Line, there is is little elaboration on this extremely important feature.  There is no mention or even links to Danau Kelimutu, or to the the Komodo dragon, even though there are articles on both of those subjects.
:Neither is there any mention, in the tragically short description of Indonesian Culture, of the Minangkabau people. Nor, in the linked but poorly written "Indonesian Culture" article, is there any mention the Matriarchal  Society of the Minangkabau, strange since the Wikipedia Matriarchal/Matrilineal societies list comprises only 39 groups throughout history.  There is no direct link to the "Indonesian Cuisine" article, and in the "Indonesian Culture", Indonesian cuisine is described by someone who pretty clearly knows almost nothing about Indonesian cuisine, which, according to first sentence of the "Indonesian Cuisine" article, "...is one of the most vibrant and colourful cuisines in the world, full of intense flavour."  To be honest I would have to say the "Indonesian Cuisine" article has a lot more relevant, practical, and honest information about Indonesia than does the "Indonesia"article.  Someone actually decided to delete the words "religiously diverse" from the ways that Indonesia is diverse.  Just so we're all aware, while the ethnic and cultural diversities of Indonesia may be more interesting to many, there is certainly no other country in the world that has so many major religions, independently flourishing under one roof.  Granted that is a bit of a subjective statement, but it's true.  In addition to the six state-recognized religions (Christianity x2, Islam, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Hinduism), there are also members of the Jewish faith, and several animistic belief systems.  A lack of understanding on the latter issue may partly stem from the fact that "Because the government do not recognize animism indigenous tribal belief systems as official religion, as a result followers of various native animistic religions such as Dayak Kaharingan have identified themselves as Hindu in order to avoid pressure to convert to Islam or Christianity." (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Indonesia , "Other religions and beliefs").  But all this is completely immaterial to the concept of Indonesian religious diversity: in this world of globalization, it's hard to find a country ''without'' several different religious beliefs floating around.  The point is in fact that several different religions have co-existed (not always peacefully, even today) in the area that is known as Indonesia ''for thousands of years''.
Again, almost all of this information can be found ''somewhere'' on Wikipedia, but to force the casual or even fairly intrepid-if-uninformed reader to dig so hard for it is, again, indirect censorship.  
While this is one of my first visits to this page, and my first attempt to edit even the Talk page, from reading the Talk page of this article, I feel that the "dominant" established users on this page are censoring the article.  The people who are editing this article are not qualified to do so, and apparently not pro-active enough to actually read the information others have put forth.  So unlock it and give the rest of us a chance.  Tear down this ****ing wall.  Apologies, but I am very frustrated and disappointed with this article.

Griffin was also a longtime affiliate of the John Birch Society, which published several of his nutty books.

He is perhaps best known as the author of ''The Creature from Jekyll Island'' (1994), which promotes conspiracy theories about the Federal Reserve System.

Starting as a [[child actor]] for radio, he became an announcer and assistant station director.

{{rfcquote|text=
At a previous discussion at [[Template talk:Infobox_officeholder/Archive 18#RfC on successor/predecessor where a district is not reasonably viewed as the same after redistricting]] consensus was established to substitute the word "redistricted" at the predecessor and/or successor parameters in the case of redistricting under the there described circumstances. Although this was not widely implemented, only a micro-fraction of articles were adequated to this new usage, it led to a controversy because the usage in infoboxes subsequently seemed to be out of step with the usage in succession boxes. This was discussed at [[Template talk:Succession box#RfC]] without conclusion to date. I have given the whole matter a bit of thought and would like to say the following:
*'''Infoboxes''' are supposed to tell about the history of the subject of the article, in this case, the life of politician.
*'''Succession boxes''' are supposed to tell you about the history of the '''office'''.
This shows clearly that both the content and the format of these boxes may very well be quite different, since they serve different purposes. However, some people will always claim that the content should be the same everywhere, which then leads to edit-wars which will flare up again and again and are difficult to resolve. On the other side, in my opinion, to split up the tenures of the congressman (caused by redistricting/renumbering) is out of scope in an infobox. The district number has, under any circumstances, no '''biographical''' value at all, and as [[User:Collect]] correctly stated, is not used in Congress itself. The district number has '''encyclopedical''' value, and serves to compile and maintain complete lists. They are also used to legally describe the district at the election, and serve in the case of sitting congressmen to find info on their current district, by reading articles like [[New York's 13th congressional district]]. At these articles a map and info on the present characteristics of the district can be found.

Considering the above, I propose the following: 

#'''In the infobox of a US representative, the tenure should not be split if the person has been continuously sitting in Congress, disregarding the redistricted numbers. The predecessor and/or successor should show the actual previous or next officeholder, if the subject defeated/was defeated by the other person, or succeeded/was succeeded without redistricting. In all other cases, the parameter should be omitted. If the representative is still sitting, "currently representing the Xth District" should be added.'''
#'''Succession boxes shall be used as they are, showing the predecessor and the successor according to the pertaining list of the district as numbered.'''

See the following examples:

<gallery>
File:Infobox example 1.jpg|Infobox usage under the current consensus
File:Infobox example 2.jpg|Infobox usage under the previous consensus
File:Infobox example 3.jpg|Proposed future usage in the infobox
File:Succession box example.jpg|Succession boxes remain as they are
</gallery>

The combination of the info as stated in the proposed new infobox combined with the succession box make two things clear: The representative, Rangel in this example, has been sitting continuously for more than 40 years in Congress, and thus neither did lose an election nor was preceded or succeeded in Congress by anybody except back in 1971 by Powell. The representative's district was apportioned different areas necessarily including his residence, and was numbered differently, usually every 10 years, and for encyclopedic reference a link is given to the list which shows the history of the district as numbered as well as those representatives who used that numbers during their elections before and after the subject of the article.

There is currently a dichotomy between the number of states where same sex marriage is legal (36) and the number of states listed in the table (37). This is due to the addition of Missouri to the table. Since the table is "States that license same-sex marriage" and the explanatory note says: "This table shows only states that license same-sex marriages or have legalized it. It does not include states that recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions but do not license them" I believe Missouri should be removed from the list until a ruling covering the whole state is put into effect.

This concerns the first paragraph of [[WP:OUTING]] as below:

''Posting another editor's personal information is harassment, unless that person had voluntarily posted his or her own information, or links to such information, on Wikipedia. Personal information includes legal name, date of birth, identification numbers, home or workplace address, job title and work organisation, telephone number, email address, other contact information '''(including any other accounts on any other web sites)''', or photograph whether any such information is accurate or not. Posting such information about another editor is an unjustifiable and uninvited invasion of privacy and may place that editor at risk of harm outside of their activities on Wikipedia. This applies to the personal information of both editors and non-editors. Any edit that "outs" someone must be reverted promptly, followed by a request for oversight to delete that edit from Wikipedia permanently. If an editor has previously posted their own personal information but later redacted it, it should not be repeated on Wikipedia; although references to still-existing, self-disclosed information is not considered outing. If the previously posted information has been removed by oversight, then repeating it on Wikipedia is considered outing.''

The bolded words were added on 22 October 2014 by [[User:GRuban|GRuban]] on the basis of a discussion with the [[WP:FUNCTIONARY|functionaries]] on their private mailing list. This has been subject to some discussion above though it was never resolved. I have reverted this to seek clarity from the community before an alternate version is inserted (or before this is reinserted if there is no suitable alternative, or to confirm that the text need not be inserted again). Is the blanket statement that 'any other accounts from any other websites should never be posted' consistent with the community's view? If not, but something does need to be in the policy, how can it be reworded or reintroduced - as I am not sure myself how to cater for this yet.

This article was in a stable state for more than six years. Now we are facing with
*Removal of the references [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magnum_Crimen&diff=641162387&oldid=641161792 here] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magnum_Crimen&diff=641419214&oldid=641403471, here]
*The referenced text altered after removing reference: "Novak was a Croat by birth, and he has been, since 1924, active among the Serbs" turned into "An ethnic [[Croat]] by birth, he has been, since 1924, active as a priest among ethnic Serbs, who are traditionally Orthodox."
*Huge number of ''clarify'', ''fact'', and ''POV'' without any justification or explanation on the talk page, and refusal to do it, when asked;
*POV and disqualifying: "As reported by the Serbian daily ''[[Politika]]'', the publication of the English language edition was financed by a friend of [[Milorad Ekmečić]], <u>a Serbian nationalist historian</u>, who also wrote the foreword to the edition".
* Sidetracking of the issues arised on the talk page, baseless accusations for not following Wikipedia rules and ridiculing the opponents in discussion
**Examples: I requested avoiding removal of references and distortions of the quoted text which was countered by ridiculing the request "<u>it's not that the original text should not be changed - if it's not an attributed quote ("according to Lutz, Novak was 'blah blah'"), it must be changed</u>" by [[User:GregorB|GregorB]] then again by the same user "<u>That's news to me</u>". The next incivilty was addressing me, not the issue: "<u>User:Milos zankov, I'm afraid you are going to be more specific than that in order for your comments to be taken seriously".</u> even though I was very specific in my written request earlier on the talk page, which user [[User talk:Timbouctou]] refused to address and then the most outrageous and false claim came from the same user "<u>Simply saying that other editor's contributions are crap and reverting ''ad nauseam'' will hardly help your case.</u>"

*WorldCat is an academic inter library search engine in use worldwide and Troicki's review of Magnum Crimen is not questionable therefore all valid references.
*''Serbian reprint [1986] Amid a <u>rise in nationalism</u> in Yugoslavia in the 1980s Magnum Crimen was reprinted in Belgrade in 1986, the same year as the SANU memorandum.[8] Dragoljub Živojinović and Dejan Lučić also released their Varvarstvo u ime Hristovo: prilozi za Magnum Crimen (Barbarity in the Name of Christ: Supplements for Magnum Crimen) in 1988.[8] Magnum Crimen was released with a new foreword by Jakov Blažević, a  <u>lifelong communist official and the prosecutor</u> at the trial of Aloysius Stepinac.[18]'' burdened by political connotations which are un-encyclopaedic per se and of no importance to this book review.
*The addition "''According to the same article, the publication of the English translation intentionally coincided with the start of the trial for mutual lawsuits in the Croatia–Serbia genocide case before the International Court of Justice, so that "the world would be informed about Ustashe crimes against Serbs during the Second World War".[31]''" is completely fabricated and not verified by reference [31].
*Logical fallacy: "''According to Croatian historian Bogdan Krizman, he was present at a meeting where his father Hinko Krizman (then minister of social politics in the new Croatian communist government), Duško Brkić (then minister of justice) and Viktor Novak agreed to prepare the work for Stepinac's trial.[23][dubious – discuss] Ultimately, it was published by the state Publishing Institute of Croatia in 1948.''"
:Stepinac's trial ended in September 1946, this book was finished and published in 1948. Krizman nowhere said it, it's Kristo's who said 'Krizman said'.

The section as it stands right now is useless.  It seems to have all the disadvantages of [[WP:BIDIRECTIONAL]] and none of the benefits.  It is much too long, unmanageable, and disoriented.  Some editors seem to think that anyone who had some ties to socialism and living in America warrants their name being included, I personally do not think that this is helpful to anyone.  It seems to be subject to the whim of a few editors (myself included) in regards to who/what should be included.  I suggest that we do away with all the names and maybe start it off it off with just a few names that are not controversial and build from there, requiring consensus for the added names to avoid any POV pushing or agenda driven additions.  I also believe that maybe we should do a request for comment or seek a third party perspective? -[[User:Xcuref1endx|Xcuref1endx]] ([[User talk:Xcuref1endx|talk]]) 23:27, 18 January 2015 (UTC)}}

'''What borders should be used as base for information presentation on Israel: the UN arranged borders of 1947, the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] borders of the 1949 Armistice Agreements, the borders to which Israel established military control in areas named the West Bank, the Golan Heights and (possibly) Gaza or another option?'''

It is proposed that Wikipedia should present clear border defined content related to its presentation and that the article should not include some information and images from within one border defined area while discounting other information from within the same border defined area.  

I think that it also needs to be decided/clarified which description of borders are to be used and to what extent reference should be made to other borders.  

Parameters of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]]<br />
I think that it should be noted that Armistice Demarcation Lines do not change borders. As noted by another editor in another discussion, the Armistice Agreements specifically say;
:Egypt/Israel - Article 4. 3. ''"It is emphasized that it is '''not the purpose of this Agreement to establish, to recognize, to strengthen, or to weaken or nullify, in any way, any territorial''', custodial or other rights, claims or interests which may be asserted by either Party '''in the area of Palestine''' or any part or locality thereof covered by this Agreement, whether such asserted rights, claims or interests derive from Security Council resolutions, including the resolution of 4 November 1948 and the Memorandum of 13 November 1948 for its implementation, or from any other source. '''The provisions of this Agreement are dictated '''exclusively by military considerations''' and are valid only for the period of the Armistice.'''"''

I afraid that recent edits may escalate to a full edit war. Some events inserted in Benigno Aquino III's presidency has disputed notability in relation to his presidency. There needs to be Consensus or guideline on what to be included or not.

Some of the disputed events in question which has been added and reverted in recent history. I may have forgot some entries here.

* [[Aman Futures Group|Aman Futures]] & Rasuman Group [[Pyramid scheme|Pyramiding scam]]
* [[Gwendolyn Garcia|Gwen Garcia's Suspension]]
* [[2013 in the Philippines|Nicole Ella's mystery death]]
* [[Kawit shooting|Kawit massacre]]

* [[2014 in the Philippines|Delfin Lee capture]]

* [[Enzo Pastor|Enzo Pastor slay case]]
* [[Iglesia ni Cristo|Iglesia ni Cristo Centennial]]
* [[Jovito Palparan#Arrest|Arrest of Palparan]]
* [[2014 in the Philippines|EDSA Hullidap]]

Here are some of my opinion on selected cases.
* The Aman Futures scam is arguably notable, but doesn't have a standalone article hence it is reverted.
* Gwen Garcia's suspension may have be a result of a political tension between the ruling party and the opposition but this isn't really a defining moment for Aquino's presidency.
* Nicole Ella's death isn't really that notable and and example of a [[WP:SENSATION|media hype]] and arguably an example of [[Silly season]] reporting, a case the media used as a highlight in relation to annual New Year's eve celebration death from indiscriminate firing of guns and firecrackers.
* Manny Pacquiao's tax issues are nothing of concern with President Aquino's presidency.
* The Mountain Province bus accident and Death of Tado Jimenez is non-notable in relations to Aquino's presidency.
* Vhong Navarro assult incident again has nothing to do with Aquino's presidency. Its supposed national significance is [[WP:SENSATION|media hype]] due to widespread coverage of the media some days after the incident. The case maybe notable itself but has nothing to do or has minimal effect to Aquino's presidency.
* The EDSA Hulidap, is also an example of [[WP:SENSATION|media hype]]. [[WP:EVENTCRIT|Viral videos]] are usually not notable. The case maybe notable but again not in relation with Aquino's presidency. It maybe notable in relation to Metro Manila afairs but this is not a national issue.

If a president comments or somehow involved on an issue, such as Pacquiao's tax issues, it does not automatically says that the issue is relevant to Aquino's presidency. Again only events/issues with relations to Aquino's presidency should be included not just events tthat happened during his presidency. Might as well include Marian Rivera and Dingdong Dantes'wedding, since Aquino attended such event and was criticized for attending the wedding a midst a Typhoon. Kidding aside, widespread coverage does not automatically assume a siginificant connection of an event to Aquino's presidency. --[[User:Hariboneagle927|Hariboneagle927]] ([[User talk:Hariboneagle927|talk]]) 04:16, 14 January 2015 (UTC)}}

- Does [[WP:BLP]] still apply to this article?<br>

{{rfcquote|text=
This article is about the evolution-creation controversy. A previous RfP by Cposper regarding this one sentence edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creation%E2%80%93evolution_controversy&diff=639638938&oldid=639628146}\]had mixed reactions, with most negative comments suggesting that more sources than the two clearly one-sided sources cited by Cposper were needed. See for example AndytheGrump's comments[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACreation%E2%80%93evolution_controversy&diff=639718199&oldid=639704888][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACreation%E2%80%93evolution_controversy&diff=639724729&oldid=639721737]

My proposed section, copied below, attempts to address the deficiencies of Cposper's contribution using 14 reliable sources on both sides of the controversy.  The outline is simple. The first paragraph affirms the overwhelming support for evolution in academia. The second paragraph cites sources asserting discrimination against academics expressing any doubts, the third paragraph cites sources asserting the claim of discrimination is false and/or exaggerated. 

Personally, I'm not a creationist.  I only came to this article because of Cposper's RfC with a desire to encourage the process described in [[WP:PRESERVE]], trying to build rather than block it.  I have persisted on this talk page and through this RfC because I put effort into my original contribution and believe opposition to it, is totally contrary to [[WP:PRESERVE]] and represents problems with [[WP:OWN | ownership]] sentiments that discourage new editors.

My addition:

:==='''Appeals to Scientific Consensus''''''

Three questions for the RfC:

'''Q1.'''  Is the above material relevant to the topic, the evolution-creation controversy?

'''Q2.'''  Keeping in mind that [[WP:PRESERVE]] techniques can be used to improve this contribution and further refine the balance and sources, does this contribution and 14 reliable sources provided form a reasonable starting point for refining the contribution in a way that improves the article?

'''Q3.'''  Does this contribution "actually make the article worse"? -- justifying reversion per [[WP:Revert only when necessary|Revert only when necessary]]?  See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Revert_only_when_necessary#Unacceptable_reversions the "Unacceptable reverts" subsection]  

'''Please Note:''' Q3 is framed in the negative, with a NO favoring inclusion of he above contribution.   '''No, No, Yes,''' opposes inclusion on all grounds.  '''Yes, Yes, No''' favors inclusion on all three grounds.

Please remember this is not a poll on the validity of the claims of discrimination, much less creationism.  It is strictly a poll on whether the proposed content is suitable to the article, supported by reliable sources, and a reasonable first draft to improve the coverage of the subject for our readers.--[[User:GodBlessYou2|GodBlessYou2]] ([[User talk:GodBlessYou2|talk]]) 22:23, 15 January 2015 (UTC)}}

A new editor has been making wholesale changes to the Campus rape article.  As part the editors approach, the editor has chosen to de-emphasize current US government surveys and statistics, including a very recent Department of Justice report and give equal footing to studies that sometimes older, less rigorous, narrower in sample quality, or less well known.

Here's a comparison between the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Campus_rape&oldid=640939367#Prevalence previous approach] which was very specific, and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_rape#Prevalence the current favored] by the recent editor.

Given there is a lot of debate between which statistics to present, should we emphasize recent, government statistics on the problem, or treat any and all studies or conclusions equally (regardless of quality, age, scope) as is being done in the current article.15:05, 16 January 2015 (UTC)}}

==Background'''

Reviewing submissions at  [[WP:Articles for Creation|Articles for Creation]] using  the [[WP:AFCR|Helper Script]] is currently restricted to users who have:

* a Wikipedia account at least 90 days old.
* a minimum of 500 undeleted edits to articles.
* thoroughly read and understood the reviewing instructions.
* a good understanding of the policies mentioned in the reviewing instructions, including the various special notability categories.

Currently, any autoconfirmed users are able to add their names to the list whether they are qualified or not.

'''Further reading'''

*[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/RfC Reviewer permission|RfC September 2013]], in which there was consensus for the creation of a permission required to review drafts at Articles for Creation
* [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/RfC for AfC reviewer permission criteria|RfC January 2014]], in which the criteria for giving users this permission were established
* [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/RfC for AfC reviewer permission implementation|RfC March 2014]], in which the implementation of this permission was agreed upon
* [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Participants]], where the current requirements are visible

'''Issues'''

The page at  [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Participants]] where users can enter themselves on  a list  that  authorises them to use  the Helper Script  is under no  other restrictions than Semi Protection (registered, autoconfirmed accounts). Users can do  this whether they  meet the requirements or not. A simple glance at the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Articles_for_creation/Participants&action=history List  Page History] will show that it needs constant  monitoring, but  also  that  very  few AfC regulars are actually  monitoring it. In  the worst case scenario, users who have been removed from the list will continue to  review and in  one instance [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive871#User:Lynctekrua_and_AfCs hack  the script  so  that  they  can use it  anyway] in  defiance of being asked to refrain  from reviewing.

Other users have been known to  enter themsleves in  order to  review their own submissions, and the main  problem  is that  many  users hover over their edit  count  to  enter their names as soon  as they  reach  the 500 edit/90 day  threshold but  without  having  any  additional  relevant  experience.

'''Proposal'''

To  reduce the need for constant monitoring of the page at  [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Participants]] and to  help  ensure a higher standard or reviewing it  is proposed to:
*Place the page under full  protection (editing  by  adminstrators only)
*Undo the redirect of the talk  page so  that the list once again has its own talk  page.
*Oblige editors to  make an [[Wikipedia:Edit requests|Edit Request]] on  the talk  page for their name to  be added to the list.
*In a similar manner to  the way  access to  [[WP:AWB|AWB]] is accorded, admins will  review the requests and at  their discretion, add the editor  to  the list  of authorised Helper Script users or decline the request.
*Encourage AfC admin regulars to  keep  that  talk  page on their watchlist  and process the requests.

#'''NOTE''': This is an interim  emergency  solution to  be implemented until  a better solution  can be found.
#'''NOTE''': This is practically  a straw poll. Please DO NOT propose alternative solutions here. If you  wish  to  suggest  another method of control please start  a separate RfC.
*<small>This RfC will  run for 30 days or until  a clear consensus emerges. It  is recommended that  this RfC be closed by  an Admin - one who  has no previous involvement in  the AfC process. Editors who  have participated in  similar discussions will  be notified of this RfC in  accordance with canvassing guidelines.</small>

The list of tragedies in the bullet point that states "when a president proclaims it" is too large, as 1). the list is overly long as is and is just going to get inevitably larger, and 2). it states "such as", as in "a few examples"; the list instead lists every single major tragedy in America since the early 2000s.

{{rfcquote|text=
There is currently a debate as to the prose in the first paragraph of the lede. [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] has championed the following prose (or a variation of it), which they authored several days ago: "'''Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (Russian: Еле́на Петро́вна Блава́тская, born Helena von Hahn 12 August [O.S. 31 July] 1831 – 8 May 1891), a Russian by birth, travelled widely and became involved with the spiritualist movement. While for a time in the United States (1873-1878), she became a founder member of a society that took the name Theosophical Society and gained an international following. She later wrote that the Theosophy she propounded was not a religion but religion itself.[1]'''"

Conversely, I have argued that this reads poorly, duplicates information found in more appropriate places elsewhere in the lede, and ignores key information (such as that Blavatsky was an [[occultism|occultist]]). Instead, I have proposed the following (or a variation of it): '''Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (Russian: Еле́на Петро́вна Блава́тская, born Helena von Hahn 12 August [O.S. 31 July] 1831 – 8 May 1891) was a Russian-born American [[occultism|occultist]] and author. She promoted the religion and philosophy of [[Theosophy]], which she interpreted as a revival of the ancient knowledge of humanity, and was a co-founder and key theoretician of the [[Theosophical Society]] in 1875.'''" My proposed wording (which is based upon imitating the lede structure found on GA and FA esotericism articles like [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)]]) has been supported by [[User:Trinity9538|Trinity9538]] although has been opposed by Qexigator, who instead favours their own original wording. Input from other editors would be greatly appreciated here. 14:30, 24 January 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The [[autism]] article was listed at FAC in 2007.  Eight years have passed and the article is due for a featured article review as much has changed.  Since that time, at least two notable books have been published and "canonized" in the autism literature.  These include [[Temple Grandin]]'s ''Thinking in Pictures: My Life with Autism'' (2011) and Julia Bascom's ''Loud Hands: Autistic People, Speaking'' (2012).  

A dispute over adding these two sources to a further reading section has arisen.  Four questions have been raised about including these sources:

# Are they notable?  
# Are they broad in scope?
# Are they controversial?
# Is there consensus for inclusion?

This RfC is intended to solve these questions.  Both sources are about people living with autism, and directly inform a [[narrative medicine|narrative medical]] approach to understanding the condition. The unstated counterargument is that these sources may not meet [[WP:MEDRS]], however, MEDRS does not rule out their use.  The question remains: should the books by Grandin and Bascom be added to the further reading section? [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] ([[User talk:Viriditas|talk]]) 06:16, 25 January 2015 (UTC)}}

Should the "Family life" subsection of this article include the statement "It is lawful for male masters to have sexual relations with wartime female captives and slaves.", or should that information be given elsewhere in Wikipedia, such as in [[Islamic views on slavery]]?

'''*[[Islam]] is defined by [[Quran]], and  also by the teachings, normative example and way of life of [[Muhammad]] which are [[Sunnah]] and [[Hadith]]. Muhammad was a slave owner and trader, Muhammad captured slaves in battle and Muhammad (like many other Islam's prophets[http://islamqa.info/en/10382]) had sex with his slaves (such as [[Maria al-Qibtiyya]], Rayhana bint Zayd ibn Amr, Al-Jariya, Tukana al-Quraziya and many others [http://wikiislam.net/wiki/List_of_Muhammads_Wives_and_Concubines]). Both Quran (verses such as Quran (33:50), Quran (23:5-6), Quran (4:24), Quran (8:69), Quran (24:32), Quran (2:178), Quran (16:75)) and hadith[http://www.thereligionofpeace.example.com/quran/015-slavery.htm] allow male masters to have sex with female slaves. Islamic [[sharia law]] accepted (and accepts) sex slavery [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_1.shtml#h2 ] In modern times, most Muslims choose to disregard Islamic banking laws, hijab, praying 5 times a day, having 4 wives, and many things. And though it's common sense that if you have children with slaves, they are part of your family. There are many reliable sources such as this: [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GlqeC1ZFAUEC&pg=PA66&dq=%22In+fact,+slaves+are+also+considered+a+part+of+the+family,+so+while+a+man+may+have+sexual+intercourse+with+the+female+slave+that+he%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FPm_VNbuJMbO7gbqpoB4&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22In%20fact%2C%20slaves%20are%20also%20considered%20a%20part%20of%20the%20family%2C%20so%20while%20a%20man%20may%20have%20sexual%20intercourse%20with%20the%20female%20slave%20that%20he%22&f=false], that explicitly state that sex slaves are considered part of family according to Islam. 1 or 2 sentences about it are warranted in the "Family life" subsection of this main article. We ought represent Islam as it is. Slavery is widespread in present time in Muslim world, as evidenced by the acts of ISIL[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30573385], BOKO Haram[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/05/08/girls-held-by-boko-haram-face-auction-life-as-sex-slaves-if-rescue-fails/), ], Taliban[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,201892,00.html], Pakistan[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2858775/Paying-debts-brick-brick-Pakistani-modern-day-slaves-trapped-lifetime-hardship.html] and many others. In Islamic Republic of Mauritania, there's slavery openly even today [http://thinkafricapress.com/mauritania/alive-and-well-mauritania-slavery-and-its-stubborn-vestiges]. Prominent Saudi religious authority recently called for slavery to be re-legalized there as it's explicitly permitted in the Quran[http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2003/11/saudi-religious-leader-calls-for-slaverys]. Egypt, Indonesia, Sudan and Yemen are some other Muslim countries where slavery still exists today[http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Slavery#Modern_Day]'''--[[User:Dustylappss|Dustylappss]] ([[User talk:Dustylappss|talk]]) 22:20, 27 January 2015 (UTC)}}

At present, we use the title "[[Lugansk People's Republic]]" for this entity. The region of Ukraine is referred to as "[[Luhansk Oblast]]", and the city is referred to as "[[Luhansk]]". The city and the oblast are almost always referred to by their Ukrainian names, and Wikipedia naming conventions at [[WP:P-NUK]] and [[WP:UKROM]] dictate that those names should be used. It seems as if the People's Republic is another story, however, as it isn't clear if it falls into the scope of the guidelines on Ukrainian places. The claimed territory of the LPR does contain many Ukrainian speakers. As far as I can tell, they are less gung-ho on the Russian business than the DPR. Ukrainian is an official language of the LPR, along with Russian. Is there any real reason why this article should not be called the "Luhansk People's Republic", to match the articles on [[Luhansk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast]]?

{{rfcquote|text=
{{ambox|text=For background information see [[WP:BASC]], [[WP:UTRS]] and [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/BASC reform 2014]].}}

'''Purpose'''

During the [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/BASC reform 2014|last discussion]] of reforming the Ban Appeals subcommittee (BASC) there appeared to be a rough consensus to change the way the subcommittee is structured, moving it away from a duty for active [[WP:ARBCOM|arbitrators]]. However, no consensus was reached as to what exactly the new committee might look like. This second phase is intended to complete the process of changing the subcommittee to some new form, or possibly to do away with it altogether.

Additionally, there is some concern that the [[WP:UTRS|Unblock Ticket Response System]] is experiencing issues involving backlogs of large numbers of requests with no merit, is simply replicating the on-wiki request for unblock process, and as such is suffering from a lack of interest. 

Note that this discussion applies to the review processes for bans or long-term blocks imposed by administrators. It does not affect bans imposed by the Arbitration Committee or through a community based process such as discussion at [[WP:AN]].

'''Proposals'''

Several proposals are presented below, each with a section for discussion. Users may support or oppose as many of these proposals as they wish, but should note that some proposals are [[mutually exclusive]] of one another. It is therefore suggested that users review all proposals before deciding which to support or oppose. 

Anyone is free to add new proposals, but should '''carefully read existing proposals''' first. If you only wish to see a minor change to one of the existing proposals, the best way to do that is to just say in that proposal's discussion section instead of presenting it as a whole new proposal.

'''Just get rid of BASC'''

Review of email ban appeals have taken up a large amount of volunteer time with little benefit to the project. BASC is therefore permanently disbanded. Talk page appeals and [[WP:UTRS]] will be the only avenues of appeal.

'''Discussion of just get  rid of BASC'''

*'''Conditional support''':  I'd like to see some additional leeway for administrators to establish conditions attached to unblocks, which is currently the only advantage that the BASC system has over straight unblock request/UTRS request. What isn't necessarily obvious is that the vast majority of BASC appeals are decided by a single arbitrator as well, and many are automatically rejected because the user hasn't jumped through the right hoops.

The purpose of this RfC is to gather opinions on what to do with the first sentence of the Grant citation at the end of the “Criticism” section: “[The CMT] has 'again and again been answered and annihilated by first-rank scholars'” (which is itself a citation from the non-academic [[Roderic Dunkerley]]’s 1957 book Beyond the Gospels). 

Even if it were true in 1977 (and how could it have been, since nothing that is “annihilated” survives another 40 years?) this statement by classicist Michael Grant is evidently not true today, for the CMT is very much 'alive' as we see from the section “Citations Demonstrating Scholarly Support for the CMT”[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Christ_myth_theory#Citations_Demonstrating_Scholarly_Support_for_the_CMT] and from the section of the article "21st Century."[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_myth_theory#21st_Century] For these reasons, either this part of the Grant citation must (a) be deleted; or (b) if retained, then information must be added clarifying why it is not true today. 

As we have recently been reminded through our recent lengthy feuding over the “no serious scholar” part of the Grant citation, it is never a good idea to advocate for ''known false content'', or to deliberately retain such content in Wikipedia (even if the content is from a scholarly source)--especially through persistence, reverts, and edit warring. The strongest sanctions can be the penalty for such cases of ‘editing in reverse.’ In the final analysis, Wikipedia does its best to deliver up to date, verifiably correct information.[[User:Renejs|Renejs]] ([[User talk:Renejs|talk]]) 17:18, 30 January 2015 (UTC)}}

 The article indeed refers to the books of Phillipson and Meyer, yet both make clear that they did not write about just any "reform in Judaism" but of the way in which [[Reform Judaism]] developed historically. I refer you especially to Meyer's "Preface:Considerations of Historiography", and also to Phillipson's treatment of other non-(or perhaps not fully)-Orthodox phenomena. For example: "religiously they are practically on the same footing. Religious Reform as conceived in Germany and realized in the United States is unknown" on [[Neolog Judaism]] (p. 396); "not a reform congregation in any sense when judged by changes in doctrine or in the content of the prayers" on [[Isaac Noah Mannheimer]]'s Vienna Rite (p. 108). As Meyer writes (copied it in the opening paragraph) the Conservatives appear mainly to provide contrast. Reconstructionist are virtually unmentioned. Therefore, I suggest that this article would either be renamed History of Reform Judaism (with other elements removed) or even deleted, with the content that does not appear in the relevant articles merged into them.

I have recently suggested the addition of the word "Guinea Pig" as a good example a misnomer on this article's page.  It has been pointed out that too many examples have creeped in before and that they should be kept down to a manageable number.  Therefore, I think Guinea Pig could replace the misnomer Norway Rat listed under the heading "Association with place other than one might assume" because guinea pigs are more well-known than Norway Rats and guinea pig has the added value of being a double misnomer (see below).  Another editor here, Sundayclose, has no problem with this addition/replacement, but we would like a wider opinion about this suggestion, because the policy on this page is that there should no additions without a consensus.  My addition/replacement, as an example of a misnomer, would read something like:<br>
 The [[Guinea Pig]] (Cavia porcellus) originated in the [[Andes]] not Guinea, and additionally is a member of the [[rodent]] family not the [[pig]].<br>

I noticed a content dispute between [[User:Yodabyte|Yodabyte]] and [[User:Alza08|Alza08]] regarding Snoop Dogg's birth name. Alza08 contends that "None of the sources provided say that "Cordozar" is his name - all of the sources provided state that his name is "Calvin Broadus, Jr" while Yodabyte states "Wrong - birth name listed on [[California Birth Index|CABI]] under Cordozar Broadus".<span class="plainlinks">[http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/cordozar_broadus_born_1971_11215767]</span> 
I don't think the question is definitively answered by the reference Yodabyte provided and rather than revert back and forth, this question should be discussed. Myself, I was surprised that so many reliable sources show his birth name as simply, ''Calvin Broadus, Jr.'' including his own web site,<span class="plainlinks">[http://www.snoop-dogg.com/biography.php]</span> and reliable sources like the ''LA Times'',<span class="plainlinks">[http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-12/entertainment/ca-33515_1_death-row-records]</span> and USA Today.<span class="plainlinks">[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2012/07/snoop-dogg-is-born-again-as-snoop-lion/1#.VKTO_nuM6So]</span>

''Should the namespace "azure" be changed from a disambiguation page [back] to an article specifically about the color?''</br>
*I realize there was some discussion about this a few years ago on this very same talk page, but am concerned that the solution arrived at was suboptimal.  I believe rather firmly that anyone typing the word "azure" into a search box is expecting to get taken (directly) to an article about the ''color'', not to a disambig page that lists such things as titles of songs or magazines, cities in Canada, or types of barley.  "Orange", for example, is different: there is the color and the fruit, and both are obvious and different (if related) meanings.  Not so with "azure", which to most readers means the color first and foremost.  In this case, it seems to make the most sense to make the search term "azure" point to an article about the ''color'' rather than a disambig page consisting of widely separated topics.

With [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon&diff=prev&oldid=645086162 this edit] I corrected the UK release date of the album to March 16, citing an article in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine as the source (see [http://books.google.com/books?id=yCcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54&dq=emi+offers+special+deal+dealers+intitle:billboard&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WtMyVNX9IY-pogTd54DoAQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=emi%20offers%20special%20deal%20dealers%20intitle%3Abillboard&f=false "EMI Offers Special Deal to Dealers"]) but it was reverted to the date Saturday, March 24. The ''Billboard'' article, in the March 24, 1973 issue, states: {{quote|EMI is to offer stock on a sale-or-return basis to selected dealers taking part in a $50,000 campaign on four albums released March 16. The four albums are: Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon," T. Rex's "Tanx," the Electric Light Orchestra's "ELO 2" and Roy Wood's "Wizzard Brew." Already 100,000 copies of the four albums have been sold even before the promotion.}} The article very clearly indicates the album was ''released'' (past tense) on March 16 and even states a sales figure for the number of albums ''already sold''.

While I see no reason to question the reliability and accuracy of this source, and it is sufficient in itself to cite the release date as March 16, I will offer further corroborating evidence. ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' entered the ''[[New Musical Express]]'' album chart dated March 24, 1973 (sales week ending Tuesday, March 20, 1973) at #4. This entry coincides with a release date of March 16 and, like the ''Billboard'' article, precludes the possibility of a release date of Saturday, March 24. The ''New Musical Express'' chart in the August 11, 1973 issue ([https://geirmykl.wordpress.com/2014/05/26/article-about-10cc-from-new-musical-express-august-11-1973/ shown here]) shows ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' in the chart for 21 weeks, verifying the debut date in the March 24 chart (simply count back 21 weeks). For comparisons sake, below is a table showing other [[EMI]] albums with documented release dates and the corresponding debut dates that also appear in the August 11 chart.

To date, recently published books about Pink Floyd have been cited for the album release dates in various Pink Floyd-related Wikipedia articles. However, those sources have been shown to be inaccurate. For instance, they show the US release date of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' as Saturday, March 10, 1973. The album debuted on the [[Billboard 200]] chart March 17, 1973 for which the sales tracking week ended March 4, precluding the possibility of a March 10 release date. Similarly, those sources give the release date of ''[[The Wall]]'' as Saturday, December 8, 1979. That album debuted on the Billboard 200 chart December 15, 1979 for which the sales tracking week ended December 2, again precluding the possibility of a December 8 release date (the U.S. copyright registration verifies the release date as November 30). Curiously, the author appears to have indiscriminately, and inaccurately, chosen a date seven days prior to the chart date as the release date which is an impossibility. Per [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources]], "the reliability of a source depends on context. Each source must be carefully weighed to judge whether it is reliable for the statement being made and is an appropriate source for that content." Considering the sources have been shown to be inaccurate for US release dates, and appears to follow a similar pattern with UK release dates, it isn't unreasonable to question the reliability of those sources.

The question is, is ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', a respected music industry trade magazine, considered a reliable source? And should it be completely disregarded in favor of another source with questionable accuracy? [[User:Piriczki|Piriczki]] ([[User talk:Piriczki|talk]]) 16:07, 1 February 2015 (UTC)}}

We should probably get to the real issue before we change the text of the MoS.  People opposing the new text here and at WT:MOS are split between "Don't change the text of the MoS ''because it is '''already''' perfectly clear that the MoS tells users to avoid the generic he''" and "Don't change the text of the MoS ''because '''changing''' the MoS so that it tells users to avoid the generic he would be bad''." (The "chairman" example was only ever here for balance.) The MoS, in its current form, leaves users divided regarding whether the generic he is ''already'' against guidance or not.  Please answer with one of the following or equivalent (so long as you are clear about what you want to do and why):

;AVOID: Change the text to tell users to avoid the generic he. (A) This is merely a clarification of what the MoS already says. (B) This is a change in guidance.
;ALLOW: Change the text to specifically allow the generic he. (C) This is merely a clarification of what the MoS already says. (D) This is a change in guidance.
;NO CHANGE: Do not change the text. (E) The MoS does not tell users to avoid the generic he, and it shouldn't. (F) The MoS already tells users to avoid the generic he, and it should. (G) Other.

User "LLArrow" and I strongly disagree about his preference for describing the Malcolm Merlyn by the codename "The Dark Archer". While it used by fans and apparently in two press releases, it does not appear in the show. I contend that to use this external information to modify the reported content of the show is misleading and violates WP:WAF guidelines. Instead, it treats this supplementary information as filling in secret gaps of the show's fictional world -- which is not how we write about fiction -- and would be a dubious inclusion even on that basis. He however contends that the name is "official," and therefore should be used at every opportunity.

Many hospital articles contain a list of notable deaths, just as township articles contain lists of notable residents, and cemeteries contain lists of notable burials.

See [[Paramus, New Jersey]] for an example of notable residents, and [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] for an example of notable burials. The hospital where you die is in the lede of obituaries, so if the reference finds it important to state, shouldn't we have a list of them at the article for that hospital? Should this article exclude the list because it is on the National Register of Historic Places? Should this article exclude the list because it is about two adjacent buildings and the deaths occurred in just the hospital? Do we need to write an article just on the hospital? Is this the hospital referred to in the obituaries or are they referring to a different incarnation not using this building?

I can't tell if this is a neologism or misspelling. All of the sources talk about watersheds. There are some articles on google about precipitationshed as a singular word, but many seem related to articles published in Sweden (ex http://www.stockholmresilience.org/21/news--events/seminar-and-events/whiteboard-seminars/9-27-2012-what-is-a-precipitationshed.html) and the author. Google even asks if I meant precipitation shed as two words. Another one uses it as a twitter hash tag (https://plus.google.com/+JeanBaptistePichancourt/posts/dSajj7daiii). Results from older literature use precipitation shed as two separate words, and start showing up on page 3 of google results (https://books.google.com/books?id=oh1aAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PR5&lpg=RA1-PR5&dq=precipitationshed&source=bl&ots=JIY4yRhZU_&sig=1WR9_aPHYjG8tcIR7X8F8pDdKCU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FAPWVPmOGoirogTz9oHwCw&ved=0CCYQ6AEwBTgU).

{{rfcquote|text=
A recent RM has brought the title to [[List of cities in Israel]] rather than the, I think, more subjectively defined [[List of Israeli cities]].  This leads to the problem that areas such as [[East Jerusalem]] and [[West bank]] settlement cities lie outside the area, even within Wikipedia's definitions, defined as the area of Israel.  

Two possible ways to resolve this situation would involve either
*Cutting content so as to fit in with some agreed limit on an agreed limit of legitimate Israeli territory.
*Again moving the article to a new title such as [[List of cities administered by Israel]] which could act as a parallel article which, for some reason, is still called [[List of cities administered by the Palestinian National Authority]].

I personally favour the second option as it would allow a broader inclusion of information while still presenting an encyclopaedic content which would not require editors to make decisions which might better be made in the sphere of international politics.  

I also think it would be worth developing an extra column to the tabulated content so as to indicate whether a city is in full or part in various areas associated with Israel: the area marked as being intended for a Jewish State in the original UN partition plan, the Jewish side of the Green line or the West Bank or the Golan Heights.  However, while comments would be appreciated, this might be an issue for another time.

{{rfcquote|text=
I would mainly like to ask about the presentation in the article about the possible presentation of content as in the article [[Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area]].  

I have recently submitted an RM from the title [[List of Israeli cities]] to [[List of cities in Israel]] contains with the suggestion that reference to East Jerusalem be removed from the article and that reference to Cities in the [[West Bank]] that were developed as [[Israeli settlements]] should be accounted for in the article with that name.  

At present, despite a recent history in which [[East Jerusalem]] and [[West Jerusalem]] have been separated by clear national border, the article presents Jerusalem as a single unit while the areas in the [[Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area]] are presented as a large number of conjoined cities.

<div style="float:right; border:1px solid silver; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;">{{Israel cities labeled map}}</div>
At present the article presents a template image as shown on the right named "Israel cities labled map" and, although the settlements are not included on the map, I think it violates NPOV as it presents an indication of East Jerusalem as Israeli territory.  It also gives some indication of the close relationship between the areas surrounding the centre of Tel Aviv which are otherwise well illustrated by [https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Tel+Aviv-Yafo,+Israel/@32.0840546,34.7611262,12z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x151d4ca6193b7c1f:0xc1fb72a2c0963f90 google maps] which seems to also be well illustrated when clicking to [https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Tel+Aviv-Yafo,+Israel/@32.0840546,34.7611262,18566m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x151d4ca6193b7c1f:0xc1fb72a2c0963f90 "earth" view.]  I am curious to know whether an influence in the subdivisions has been to present Jerusalem as being the largest "urban location" in Israel while it seems to me that this situation does not directly reflect either political or geographic realities.  Israel has not chosen to present the [[Jaffa]] area, which was described as part of the proposed "Arab State" in the UN partition plan, as a separate entity but has chosen to declare areas such as [[Holon]], where I used to live, as being cities.  

Given the above, to what extent can / should the article reflect the size of the whole [[Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area]] in its article content?

A discussion (see above) has been taking place about how to incorporate data from [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13613324.2014.946493#.VNTx6mNVK1E this journal article] into the education section of this article. The source presents data on the GSCE performance of pupils who speak Somali at home. The reason it uses this data is because there is no nationwide data on GCSE results by ethnicity at the level of detail that allows individual ethnic groups to be identified (so Somalis are often subsumed into a bigger "African" category).

This is [[User:Tmol42|Tmol42's]] suggested wording from above:

:Although no reliable nationwide statistics are available on the educational attainment of ethnically Somali pupils in the United Kingdom <sup>[1][2]</sup>  some schools and local authorities collect data using extended ethnicity codes. Additionally, since 2007 local authorities have been required by government to collect data on the main language spoken in the home of pupils, where that language is not English as part of the National Pupil Database.  In the summer of 2012, of the 2,748 pupils categorised as Black African whose home language was recorded as Somali, 47 per cent achieved five or more GCSEs including in maths and English at grades A* to C. This compares to 58 per cent of all Black African pupils and an overall average for pupils in England of 59 per cent.<sup>[5]</sup>

[[User:Middayexpress|Middayexpress]] has suggested [[User_talk:AcidSnow#Somalis_in_the_UK|elsewhere]] this alternative wording (we would follow this with the statistics from Demie, I presume):

:According to the Lambeth Research and Statistics Unit, no reliable nationwide statistics are available on the size and educational attainment of Somali pupils in the United Kingdom. Data on the students has often been aggregated under a broad continental 'African' variable, which obscures the students' unique charateristics and requirements. This in turn inhibits targeted policy making and practice developments at the national and local level. To redress this, various London Local Authorities, where most Somali pupils attend school, have started gathering and monitoring data on the Somali student community.

Could we get editors' preferences, if they have any, on which of these to use, or comments for improving either of them? [[User:Cordless Larry|Cordless Larry]] ([[User talk:Cordless Larry|talk]]) 08:05, 8 February 2015 (UTC)}}

This idea stems from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Harassment/Archive_1#Wikihounding a discussion] at the [[WP:HARASS|harassment policy]] regarding the possibly offensive use of "stalk", "stalking", "stalker" when talking about people on Wikipedia. It was decided several years ago to mark the [[WP:STALK]] shortcut historical due to the potential for offending users, and since the change there has been a note there advising editors that it should not be used.

Many of you who have edited user talk pages in the past have seen the {{tl|talk page stalker}} template used as a neutral indicator that a comment is not from the owner of the talk page but from someone else who watches the page. The template links to [[Wikipedia:Talk page stalker]] which explains the template's use, and there are several related templates and userboxes floating around the project for this purpose. Recently, [[User:NeilN]] created a new template {{tl|talk page watcher}} to allow the use of a similar template without needing to use the terminology that some users find offensive (and others have stated they find confusing). That template has been [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2015 February 24#Template:Talk page watcher|nominated for <s>deletion</s>discussion]] and that seems to be resulting in a [[WP:SNOW|snowball keep]], with several commenters saying they prefer the new template over the old. That indicates to me that there is consensus to adopt this change (stalker -> watcher) across the project, and I would like to test that here.

I propose that in the project-side context of an editor who participates in discussions on other users' talk pages ([formerly] a "talk page stalker"), "watcher" should replace or be preferred to "stalker" in any place it occurs on the project.

This proposal includes:
*moving [[Wikipedia:Talk page stalker]] → [[Wikipedia:Talk page watcher]] and rewording many instances of "stalker" on that page; (edit: please see [[User:Ivanvector/Talk page watcher|this example]])
*moving the subpages of [[Wikipedia:TPS]] to subpages of [[Wikipedia:TPW]] (such as [[WP:TPS/userbox]]) and rewording the contents of the subpages per the above;
*keeping the {{tl|talk page watcher}} template(s) (subject to the TfD discussion);
*other related changes that may be required.
This proposal does ''not'' include changes to the existing {{tl|talk page stalker}} template such as changing its wording or redirecting it to the new template - it is transcluded nearly 10,000 times and changes to it will break things. Some users will want to continue using those templates or won't know about this change - they should be ''discouraged'' but not ''forcibly prevented'' from using it.

The Ponzi scheme dispute section currently contains this: 

(Oppose) "In the opinion of Eric Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago "A real Ponzi scheme takes fraud; bitcoin, by contrast, seems more like a collective delusion."

I would like to change it to this:

 The article states that [[United Flight 93]] veered off-course precisely over Columbia Township. However, looking at the [http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2006/04/13/us/20060413_MOUSSAOUI_GRAPHIC.html map provided], it doesn't look like it. It appears as on the border of Columbia and Olmsted Townships, and not just Columbia. The map also appears to be a rough estimate, so there's no real telling that the plane actually veered off-course over Columbia Township, and there's no other sources (that I'm aware of at least) that show/state otherwise.

In my humble opinion, this section suffers from [[WP:UNDUE]] and from the lack of factual accuracy [[WP:FACT]]. 

There are hints that actually Germans were those behind extermination of the Serbs:
:''The Nazis encouraged Ustaše anti-Jewish and anti-Roma actions and showed support for the intended extermination of the Serb people. Soon, the Nazis began to make clear their genocidal goals, as shown by the speech Hitler gave to Slavko Kvaternik, at their meeting on 21 July 1941'':

If you read the quoted speech it is clear that it has no connection to the first sentence above as to the Serbs.

:''The extermination of Serbs at Jasenovac was precipitated by General Paul Bader, who ordered that refugees be taken to Jasenovac.''

The statement above is false and illogical.

:''In the Wannsee Conference, Germany offered the Croatian government transportation of its Jews southwards, but questioned the importance of the offer, saying that: "the enactment of the final solution of the Jewish question is not crucial, since the key aspects of this problem were already solved by radical actions these governments took ...''

The statement above has a very remote connection to the existence of the Jasenovac Concentration Camp

:''Hans Helm was in charge of deportation of Jews to concentration camps. He was tried in Belgrade in December 1946 along with other SS and Gestapo officials, and was sentenced to death by hanging together with August Meissner, Wilhelm Fuchs, Josef Hahn, Ludwig Teichmann, Josef Eckert, Ernst Weimann, Richard Kaserer and Friedrich Polte.''

The above text has a remote connection to the Jasenovac, too.

'''Proposal''': Remove the complete section and integrate only relevant to the Jasenovac Camp existence text into other parts of this article.--[[User:Milos zankov|Milos zankov]] ([[User talk:Milos zankov|talk]]) 18:10, 14 February 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
When a divinity from a religion  (particularly applying to poly theistic religions) shares its name with one of more other notable topics, then the disambiguation may work in either of two ways, either to: "... (deity)" or to "... (god)" or "... (goddess)".  There may be some divinities that are not presented in relation to gender or which may have representations to which gender may be a less than prominent feature of the persona (such as with some divinities in for instance animal form).  In other cases I would like to propose that a general move is made towards "... (god)" or "... (goddess)" disambiguation as a general rule but a concerted move in the opposite direction would provide consistency.  

I have not done a full survey but from what I have seen I think that there may be a tendency to present male divinities as gods but not present female divinities as goddesses.  If this is so then this would not present NPOV and I suggest that an agreement regarding consistent presentation would resolve such an issue.  08:42, 16 February 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I've seen many articles over the years for cities that had a list of notables and at the top of the list was a see also to the corresponding category for "Category:People from Foo". As a see also, the article is *NOT* added to the category. I've since implemented that practice and seen it in use in hundreds of articles. For example, the Notable people section in the article for [[North Bergen, New Jersey]] has a see also link at the top of the section to [[:Category:People from North Bergen, New Jersey]], and this practice is widely implemented without issue; If you click on [[:Category:People from North Bergen, New Jersey]], you don't see the North Bergen article in the category. This practice serves several purposes: 1) In the exact goal of [[WP:CLN]], it allows the [[Wikipedia:Embedded lists|embedded list]] of notables in "Foo" city articles to be updated from the corresponding "Category:People from Foo" and vice versa; 2) It serves as a marker to remind those adding notables to the embedded list to remember to add the entry to the corresponding category; 3) It allows the category to be readily carried over when the embedded list is turned into a standalone article; and 4) it provides a gateway to allow readers to use the category system to navigate across other categories for notables from the same area. 

The far bigger issue here is that the premise raised by {{u|Magnolia677}} is completely and totally wrong. There is a big difference between <nowiki>1) "[[Category:People from North Bergen, New Jersey]]"</nowiki> and <nowiki>2) "[[:Category:People from North Bergen, New Jersey]]"</nowiki>; Option 1 (without the initial colon) adds the category to the article, but it's not being used here. In turn, option 2 (with a colon) does not, and we do this in Wikipedia all the time. The "see also" implements option 2 and does *NOT* add the subcategory, so the presence of the parent is irrelevant. This issue was raised and settled months ago at [[WT:CLN]], where the response was "that Magnolia677 seems to essentially concede your points in favor of including the cat link. The complaint about the wrong articles being placed in categories is 1) not relevant here on the issue of where a category link should be placed, and 2) fixable by editing the improperly categorized articles." Perpetuating his battle, Magnolia677 unfortunately misrepresents how this category is being used and is forum shopping to try to find some way to win the fight he has already lost.

The proposed added text is:
{{blockquote|
* All caps can be used when rendering quotations of texts (not headlines or proclamations) that use all capitals or small caps for effects, where removing it would constitute a significant change to the original author's style or intent.
* In reference lists author names can be given in small caps, if a citation style is chosen that uses this feature.

* In [[Interlinear gloss]]ing of linguistic examples following the Leipzig glossing rules, small capitals can be used.}}
Respondents are requested to comment on three separate questions: 
:1. Whether it is a good idea to have additional exceptions for the deprectation of allcaps?

The discussion has been made in which I had raised issues with the article, [[Talk:Hinduism#Article issues]]. It is confirmed by the multiple editors that there are problems within the article. It looks like that these editors have seen problems with many parts of the article that were introduced during mid 2013-14, there was no consensus for them and still there isn't. To know what others think, this Rfc should run atleast for a week.

The main problems are:
:(i) Neutrality issues, source misrepresentation.
:(ii) Undue weight, [[Hinduism#McDaniel_-_six_generic_.22types.22|These sections]] came to provide large opinions of individual authors, Other([[#Vedic_period_.28c._1750-500_BCE.29|section]]) discusses Indo Aryan Migration theory without mentioning the actual expressions of these authors and they are not really about Hinduism. [[Hinduism#Pre-history]] is also not about the religion.
:(iii) Repetitions. After you have a well written section about history, why we would need sections such as [[Hinduism##Periodisation]], [[Hinduism##Origins]], and some others?
:(iv) Quote farming. 

These are somethings that one of the '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hinduism&oldid=559424460 former version]''' ultimately lacked and the newer [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hinduism&diff=559434778&oldid=559433905 versions] would include above points. The former version was not perfect, yet easier to fix and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hinduism&oldid=425307907 it stood] for a long time. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hinduism&offset=&limit=500&action=history Majority] of these edits were done by a single editor. IMO, it is better to revert to the former version that I have linked. If you agree, vote with 'yes' or 'support'. [[User:Delibzr|Delibzr]] ([[User talk:Delibzr|talk]]) 06:50, 8 March 2015 (UTC)}}

For example, while patrolling new pages I came across the article [[Yacine Louati]], a quick Google search reveals that this person really does play Volleyball and at the least has some coverage (mostly foreign language websites), but other than that I have no idea how to gauge their notability in the volleyball world.

There is an ongoing dispute on the status of Albania as an Ally. The debate has stalemated since the sides seem to not agree even on basics.

:The dynamics of Albania during WW2 can be briefed as follows (extracted from a previous version of this article co-edited by various editors):

::Albania was recognized as an "Associated Power" at the 1946 Paris conference <ref>United States Department of State, Foreign relations of the United States, 1946. Paris Peace Conference : documents (1946), page 802, Article 26.a) 'Memoranda submitted by Albanian Government on the Draft Peace Treaty with Italy' "proposed amendment...For the purposes of this Treaty, Albania shall be considered as an Associated Power.", web http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1946v04/reference/frus.frus1946v04.i0011.pdf</ref> and officially signed the treaty ending WWII between the "Allied and Associated Powers" and Italy in Paris, on February 10, 1947.<ref>Treaties in Force, A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 2013", Page 453, accessible online from http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/218912.pdf </ref> <ref name="Encyclopedia of World War II, Volume 1 ">{{cite book|last1=Axelrod|first1=John|title=Encylopedia of World War II |volume=Volume 1 |quote= The first peace treaty concluded between the Allies and a former Axis nation was with Italy . It was signed in Paris on February 10 , by representatives from  Albania , Australia ....|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LbWFgjW6KX8C&pg=PA824&lpg=PA824&dq=WW2+allied+and+associated+powers+albania&source=bl&ots=ehfHi5vpFh&sig=IZ3bXd3OKFo71jBU3Abay6tt6ao&hl=en&sa=X&ei=h1bSVLe5OoT0UKCdgPAH&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=WW2%20allied%20and%20associated%20powers%20albania&f=false|date=5 February 2015|publisher=H W Fowler|isbn=978-1-84511-308-7|page=824}}</ref>. 

::From the 1939 [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italian invasion]] to 1943 it was occupied and controlled by Italy while from 1943 till 1944 it was under German control which created [[Albanian Kingdom (1943–44)|a puppet government]]. The British sent agents to Albania to coordinate the attacks of the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement]] (LANC) on the Axis forces located in the region.<ref>''The OSS in World War II Albania: Covert Operations and Collaboration with Communist Partisans'' {{page needed|date=February 2015}}</ref><ref>Manelli, Gani. "Partisan Politics in World War II Albania: The Struggle for Power, 1939-1944." East European Quarterly 40.3 (2006): 333.</ref> Over the course of the war, the casualties of the Italian and German armed forces, in the fight against the Albanian resistance, were 26,595 killed, 21,245 wounded and 20,800 prisoners. <ref>Pearson, Owen (2006). Albania in Occupation and War: From Fascism to Communism 1940-1945. I.B.Tauris. p. 418. ISBN 1-84511-104-4</ref>.

: However there are editors which OPPOSE adding Albania to the list according to diverse claims as follows:
:: Claim 1. Albania was an Axis state, therefore not an Ally.
:: Claim 2. Albania was an Associated Power according to the 1946 peace treaty with Italy, therefore not an Ally.
:: Claim 3. Albania had a resistance movement against Axis and not did not fight through the official army, therefore not an Ally.

: The response to those claims is:
:: General response: Albania was invaded by Italy in 1939, even though it militarily opposed the invasion. After the invasion the legitimate government moved to exile and was forcefully replaced by a puppet government of Italy. Albania actively fought against the Axis during the Albanian Liberation War through a resistance movement, such a contribution is well documented (see also above). It is documented that Albania suffered high war casualties in percentage of soldiers and civilians during the war against Axis. In the end of the war Albania was officially recognized as an Ally during the peace treaty with Italy (which officially ended WW2) and received war reparations.
:: Response to Claim 1. Albania was invaded and occupied by Axis, where a puppet government was created. The puppet government was not internationally recognized and did not militarily engage in fighting against Allies. In addition, other countries had pro-Axis puppet governments like France, Greece, Yugoslavia, etc ... Therefore, having a pro-Axis puppet government is not a reason for being excluded from the Allies list.
:: Response to Claim 2. Associated Power is a synonym term for "Allies" or "Allies and Associated Powers". There is no division between the status of Allies and Associated Powers in the treaties ending WW2. This categorization does not exist and is a synthesis conducted in this article.
:: Response to Claim 3. Greece and Yugoslavia also had resistance movement and their fight against Axis was conducted by the resistance, not the official governments. Since those countries are listed as Allies, Albania should be listed as well.

A personal comment: Unfortunately, I fear the discussion has also a political connotation, because the "official" history version of countries neighboring Albania, namely as Greece and Serbia, advocates Albania as Axis state. In the case of Greece, the Albania-Axis relation hypothesis was used as an alibi for ethnically cleansing Albanians in northern Greece [[Expulsion of Cham Albanians]]. While in the case of Serbia the Albania-Axis hypothesis is used to fuel the theory that during WW2 Kosovo was invaded by Albanians to create a [[Greater Albania]]. Even though there are abundant sources testifying the fighting that Albanians conducted against Axis, yet the Greek and Serbian historians (whose numbers over-scale Albanian historians) have managed to shadow the Albanian contribution against Axis. A mirroring of this politically heated historical diversion is reflected in this article as well (where again there are predominantly more Greek/Serbian editors than Albanian ones).

The dispute revolves around material from the [[World Lung Foundation]] which was removed [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Safety_of_electronic_cigarettes&diff=644322057&oldid=644321830 in this diff] and mterial from the [[World Medical Association]] was removed [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Safety_of_electronic_cigarettes&diff=644783217&oldid=644782361 in this diff]. 

The text from the WLF in our article was "The [[World Lung Foundation]] stated that "Researchers find that many e-cigarettes contain toxins, contaminants and carcinogens that conflict with the industry’s portrayal of its products as purer, healthier alternatives. They also find considerable variations in the amount of nicotine delivered by different brands. None of this information is made available to consumers so they really don’t know what they are ingesting, or how much."; cited to [http://www.worldlungfoundation.org/ht/d/ReleaseDetails/i/32757 this statement] released by the WLF.

The text from the WMA in our article was "In October 2012, the [[World Medical Association]] stated, "Manufacturers and marketers of e-cigarettes often claim that use of their products is a safe alternative to smoking, particularly since they do not produce carcinogenic smoke. However, no studies have been conducted to determine that the vapor is not carcinogenic, and there are other potential risks associated with these devices: Appeal to children, especially when flavors like strawberry or chocolate are added to the cartridges."; cited to [http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/e19 this statement] released by the WMA.

As an editor who contributed quite a bit to this article, I actually support the removal of the section on the [[Circassian beauties]], as was attempted by [[User:Tandrea Spain]] on February 18, 2015, but whose edit has since been reverted. 

While it is true that the information about the Circassian beauties is referenced, I would still call into question the relevance of this information in this article.  While the Circassian beauties may have had a hairstyle that was "similar to the afro" and while [[P.T. Barnum]] and others may have tried to market these woman to their audiences as (and I'm paraphrasing here) "exotic white women with an African-American-like identity" this does not mean that these women had afros.  

While they may have had curly hair that arguably resembled afros, in my opinion that doesn't therefore mean that their hairstyle could be called an "afro". In fact, 2 of the 3 images in the existing Wikipedia article on the Circassian beauties that purport to depict Circassian women don't even show them with "afro-like" hairstyles.  Even if it could be argued that the majority of Circassian women of that era had hairstyles resembling afros, I still would argue that this doesn't mean that they themselves should be included in the article about the afro.

Truly, the afro is simply curly or kinky hair that is cut at an equal length all around the head and, if brushed or combed and left to do what it does naturally, happens to form a spherical shape due to its natural curliness, but this natural effect was not deemed to be an actual hairstyle with a label, per se, until the 1960s when people in the black American and African-American communities started to move away from trying to hide the natural curliness/kinkiness of their hair, which they had been doing in an attempt to mimic white hairstyles.

The Circassian beauties, however, long predated the afro as an official hairstyle and I would argue that the way in which they wore their hair did not directly affect or inspire the afro as a hairstyle or stylistic statement amongst the black American or African-American community of the 1960s or beyond.

I hope that all makes sense. As an editor I tend to be of the [[Deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia|inclusionist]] mindset when it comes to information on Wikipedia, but I must admit that I didn't really agree with the Circassian beauty information when it was first added to this article, and since the attempted removal of said information and the subsequent reversion of those edits, I felt it was time to weigh-in on the subject.  

I would appreciate any other editors who might want to weigh-in on the subject.  Cheers! [[User:Marchije|Marchije]]•<sup>[[User talk:Marchije|speak]]</sup>/<sub>[[Special:Contributions/Marchije|peek]]</sub> 01:29, 20 February 2015 (UTC)}}

I remember when I had just joined Wikipedia a little over a year ago. I remember feeling really confused and wondering where I should look for information on policy, guidelines, and rules. I have spent the last year learning about these policies, guidelines, and rules, yet I am still learning new policies every day. Part of this is because there is no central collection of policies guidelines, and rules.

My proposal is to start the equivalent of the US Code and United States Reports for the English Wikipedia and if successful for the Wikimedia community at large. The Wikipedia Code (as I am calling it) shall follow the following guidelines:
# Policies, guidelines, and rules contained in the code shall have reached consensus or for other reasons be enforceable.
# Notable discussions shall be included to give context and usage to policies, guidelines, and rules. However, when consensus has not been reached in a discussion that shall be made clear.
# Notable decisions by committees on cases shall be included to give context.

* That deficiency of vitamin B17 is a cause of cancer.
* That supplementation of vitamin B17 can cure cancer.
* That the [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory|medical establishment]] conspires to suppress this.

The questions at issue are:
# Is it reasonable to describe Griffin's thesis in respect of amygdalin as scientifically unsupported (per [http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/laetrile], [http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/pharmacologicalandbiologicaltreatment/laetrile], and even [http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/QAA400624/Do-You-Need-Vitamin-B17.html], a well-known proponent of numerous quesitonable supplement claims)?
# Is it reasonable to characterise the vitamin B17 / laetrile scam, as quackery, in Wikipedia's voice (per [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.31.2.91/pdf] especially - "All prior forms of cancer quackery, however, pale in comparison with the laetrile crusade, unquestionably the slickest, most sophisticated, and certainly the most remunerative cancer quack promotion in medical history"), or must it be attributed to "the medical community", or, more accurately, the medical and scientific communities? 
# Does recent research suggesting a possible therapeutic benefit for amygdalin as an adjuvant therapy, cast sufficient doubt on the consensus [to include mention in the article]. <small>Missed form original, added after Nomoskedasticity's comments below</small>
Please address each separately.

'''General RFC discussion'''

For the avoidance of doubt my views are:
# There is no such thing as vitamin B17, there is no evidence that cancer is caused by a deficiency of the non-existent vitamin, or of amygdalin, whether or not it is a vitamin, there is no evidence that amygdalin is a cure for cancer as it is promoted by laetrile quacks, and there has never been any evidence whatsoever of a concerted cover up by the immense group of doctors, medical scientists, regulators, drug company employees and charity workers who would have to be party to any conspiracy of silence. It is therefore '''correct''', both technically and in terms of [[WP:NPOV]], to describe Griffin's view as scientifically unsupported.
# Laetrile is a fraud. Numerous prosecutions (e.g. [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ICECI/EnforcementActions/EnforcementStory/EnforcementStoryArchive/UCM091079.pdf]) attest to this. It is '''correct''' to characterise it as quackery and/or fraud and there is '''no need''' to qualify this as it is a view that has no significant dissent among the relevant scientific community. Even those investigating amygdalin as a potential therapy, do not subscribe to the laetrile narrative of cancer as a disease caused by deficiency of amygdalin.
# Recent research is '''irrelevant''' to Griffin's claims as it does not touch at any point on the narrative of laetrile: it does not demonstrate that amygdalin is a vitamin, does not support the idea that cancer as a deficiency disease, does not show that amygdalin cures cancer when administered as Griffin and other laetrile promoters claim, and if anything weakens the claims of the laetrile underground by providing a plausible explanation for the positive results found by Sugiura at MSKCC, one which refutes the narrative spun by the likes of [[Ralph W. Moss]] and other laetrile believers. Thus it is '''not relevant''' in this article and to include it would be a red herring, a [[WP:SYN|novel synthesis]] and a failure of [[WP:NPOV]]. 

Sorry to raise this issue yet again but it's clear that we need to establish an unambiguous answer to these questions so that we can break the endless circular argument. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 18:27, 22 March 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The section on the Godhra train burning in the BJP article is using weasel words to avoid stating by whom the train was burned, even though the article BJP contains paragraph upon paragraph on the related Gujarat incidents. It's like saying that [[Muath al-Kasasbeh]] was burned alive, but avoiding to state that he was burned by ISIS militants.

The [http://www.jaia-bharati.org/nicole-elfi/ni-godhra-ang.htm Godhra train burning] happened when a Muslim mob set fire with highly inflammable liquids on a train carrying Hindu pilgrims and hindered the fire fighting systems. [https://indiaview.wordpress.com/2007/10/26/the-myth-and-truth-of-godhra/ A court convicted] 31 Muslims for the incident and the conspiracy for the crime. 

The section should clearly state that the train was set on fire by a mob and that people have been convicted for it. (as the wikipedia articles already state).

Secondly, the paragraph should also state the official numbers of the victims in the riots that followed (800 Muslims, 250 Hindus), and not only estimates which  [http://www.gujaratriots.com/index.php/2008/05/myth-1-2000-muslims-were-killed-in-the-gujarat-riots/ could be inflated and/or ignore Hindu victims]. 

I propose to change the statement:

:On 27 February 2002, a train carrying Hindu pilgrims was burned outside the town of Godhra, killing 59 people. The incident was seen as an attack upon Hindus, and sparked off massive anti-Muslim violence across the state of Gujarat that lasted several weeks. The death toll estimated was as high as 2000, while 150,000 were displaced.

to:

:On 27 February 2002, a Muslim mob set on fire a train wagon carrying passengers returning from Ayodhya, killing 59 people, including twenty-seven women and ten children, who were burned alive. This incident sparked off a cycle of communal violence across the state of Gujarat that lasted several weeks. The riots resulted in the deaths of 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus, and many more were forced to seek shelter in refugee camps. Some observers have estimated the death toll to be as high as 2000, while 150,000 were displaced.

Also AP has shown that the article gives too much weight on Godhra/Babri/Gujarat riots (which are all related). Indeed, in the period 1980 to 1998 (18 years), about 95% of the article is on this issue. Did nothing else happen in these 18 years for the BJP?.

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
Please comment on sources and content regarding the use of amygdalin as an adjuvant therapy in cancer that may validate Griffin's claims. 
Griffin's claims are, as far as I understand it:
* That amygdalin is a vitamin, specifically vitamin B17.
* That deficiency of vitamin B17 is a cause of cancer.
* That supplementation of vitamin B17 can cure cancer.
* That the [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory|medical establishment]] conspires to suppress this.
The questions at issue are:
# Is it reasonable to describe Griffin's thesis in respect of amygdalin as scientifically unsupported (per [http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/laetrile], [http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/pharmacologicalandbiologicaltreatment/laetrile], and even [http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/QAA400624/Do-You-Need-Vitamin-B17.html], a well-known proponent of numerous quesitonable supplement claims)?
# Is it reasonable to characterise the vitamin B17 / laetrile scam, as quackery, in Wikipedia's voice (per [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.31.2.91/pdf] especially - "All prior forms of cancer quackery, however, pale in comparison with the laetrile crusade, unquestionably the slickest, most sophisticated, and certainly the most remunerative cancer quack promotion in medical history"), or must it be attributed to "the medical community", or, more accurately, the medical and scientific communities? 
# Does recent research suggesting a possible therapeutic benefit for amygdalin as an adjuvant therapy, cast sufficient doubt on the consensus [to include mention in the article]. <small>Missed form original, added after Nomoskedasticity's comments below</small>
Please address each separately.
;Alternative questions: (please specify if your responses pertain to the Alternative question)
:1. Is it reasonable to include Griffin's views as biographical content regarding why he wrote his book,'' World Without Cancer'', as long as his views are not given [[WP:UNDUE]], provided the current views of the medical community are properly presented including not only the research that is 30+ years old, but also the most recent research on amygdalin in 2013 - 2015?
:Note: Griffin's book, ''World Without Cancer'', includes documented evidence regarding clinical trials of various physicians [http://www.drapsley.com/Pages/LaetrileB17Critics.aspx], and the results of various physicians and scientific researchers of that time period (30+ years ago) who used the drug Laetrile, a chemically modified version of amygdalin, a natural substance found in apricots, almonds and various other fruits and nuts. [http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/pharmacologicalandbiologicaltreatment/laetrile].  Scientist Krebbs called amygdalin (B17) a vitamin, but it was never officially recorded as such. Griffin's book marshals evidence provided by physicians and researchers of that time period, much of which still applies today with regards to the natural substance, amygdalin, [http://worldwithoutcancer.org.uk] [http://worldwithoutcancer.org.uk/studies-research-more-documented-evidence/].  There are books written by whistle blowers from Memorial Sloan Kettering that exposes the fraudulent results of the 30 year old research: [http://www.secondopinionfilm.com/ralph-moss-phd-bio/#.VQ96O1yk8f0].  Griffin's book advocates for further research of amygdalin as a potential treatment for cancer but more so for the freedom of choice. [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248783.World_Without_Cancer] 
:2. Is it reasonable to include brief mention of ongoing scientific research as indicated most recently by Memorial Sloan Kettering, who finally admitted to "the recent discovery of anticancer properties of amygdalin through previously unknown mechanisms" [http://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/herb/amygdalin], as well as what is published in peer reviewed journals as long as those views are presented as ongoing research per [[WP:FRINGE]] guidelines?

Which version presents a more accurate, pertinent, current, and comprehensive summary of the United States economy? 

The thought that we should replace items of current controversy with 2009 descriptions of the 2008 recession seems almost laughably absurd to me. I had proposed that we also include the proportion of taxes paid by those with the most wealth, not just the most income. As you can see from [http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/12pwwinbulwealth07.pdf Figure H on page 164 here,] the wealthiest do not generally hold most of their assetts in current income generating investments, so they are generally not subject to taxation at the levels approaching those of the highest income earners (who are generally corporations rather than individual people anyway.)

{{rfcquote|text=
I think that there is an imbalance in the treatment of different forms of discrimination within Wikipedia.  In the current condition of Wikipedia: 
*There are many articles starting with the format [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllPages&from=Racism+in&to=&namespace=0 "Racism in ..."]
*There are no articles for titles with the format [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllPages&from=Prejudice+in&to=&namespace=0 "Prejudice in ..."]
*There are a small handful of articles for titles with the format [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllPages&from=Discrimination+in&to=&namespace=0 "Discrimination in ..."]
*There are, however, a large number of articles for titles with the format [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllPages&from=Human+rights+in&to=&namespace=0 "Human rights in ..."]

All the same I think that there is a potential lack of coverage of other non racially motivated forms of prejudice.

The [[:Template:Discrimination sidebar]] lists "general forms" of discrimination as follows"
* [[Ageism|Age]]
* [[Caste]]
* [[Class discrimination|Class]]
* [[Discrimination based on skin color|Color]]
* [[Ableism|Disability]]
* [[Genetic discrimination|Genotype]]
* [[Height discrimination|Height]]
* [[Discrimination based on hair texture|Hair]]
* [[Linguistic discrimination|Language]]
* [[Lookism|Looks]]
* [[Mentalism (discrimination)|Mental type]]
* [[Racism|Race{{\}}ethnicity{{\}}nationality]]
* [[Rankism|Rank]]
* [[Religious discrimination|Religion]]
* [[Sexism|Sex {{\}}Gender]]
* [[Sexualism|Sexuality]]
* [[Sizeism|Size]]
* [[Speciesism|Species]]
* [[Weightism|Weight]]
If there are any particularly notable issues in regard to any of these forms of prejudice in any particular location then I think that there should be a platform within Wikipedia for the presentation of related content.  

When weighing up possible titles I did the following searches in '''books''' which showed that:
*[https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Racism+and+prejudice%22&espv=2&biw=1151&bih=575&source=lnms&tbm=bks&sa=X&ei=PG_8VJnKOJLV7AbOkoGgDA&ved=0CAwQ_AUoAQ#tbm=bks&q=%22Racism+and+prejudice+in%22 "Racism and prejudice in"] gets "About 9,750 results"
*[https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Racism+and+prejudice%22&espv=2&biw=1151&bih=575&source=lnms&tbm=bks&sa=X&ei=PG_8VJnKOJLV7AbOkoGgDA&ved=0CAwQ_AUoAQ#tbm=bks&q=%22Racism+and+discrimination+in%22 "Racism and discrimination in"] gets "About 1,060 results"
*[https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#tbm=bks&q=%22Prejudice+and+racism+in%22 "Prejudice and racism in"] gets "About 8,700 results"
*[https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#tbm=bks&q=%22Discrimination+and+racism+in%22 "Discrimination and racism in"] gets "About 23,400 results"
Personally I prefer the "Racism and prejudice in ..." format as both titles deal with attitudes.  My thought here was that perhaps the Human rights articles could deal with results. 

It may also be notable that other '''books''' searches revealed that:
*[https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#tbm=bks&q=%22Prejudice+and+discrimination+in%22 "Prejudice and discrimination in"] got "About 144,000 results" and
*[https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#tbm=bks&q=%22Discrimination+and+prejudice+in%22 "Discrimination and prejudice in"] got "About 17,700 results"

None the less I thought that articles might start with a topic change to something like "Racism and prejudice in ..." and then, if content develops, further moves or divisions of article content may occur at a later date.  

Please give comments in terms of '''Support''' or '''Oppose''' and add any further comment for instance in regard to preferred title.  Thanks.

* http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/doj_report_on_shooting_of_michael_brown_1.pdf

Report conclusion:
{{talkquote|As discussed above, Darren Wilson has stated his intent in shooting Michael Brown was in response to a perceived deadly threat. The only possible basis for prosecuting Wilson undersection 242 would therefore be if the government could prove that his account is not true – i.e.,that Brown never assaulted Wilson at the SUV, never attempted to gain control of Wilson’s gun,and thereafter clearly surrendered in a way that no reasonable officer could have failed to perceive. Given that Wilson’s account is corroborated by physical evidence and that his perception of a threat posed by Brown is corroborated by other eyewitnesses, to include aspects of the testimony of Witness 101, there is no credible evidence that Wilson willfully shot Brownas he was attempting to surrender or was otherwise not posing a threat. Even if Wilson was mistaken in his interpretation of Brown’s conduct, the fact that others interpreted that conduct the same way as Wilson precludes a determination that he acted with a bad purpose to disobey the law. The same is true even if Wilson could be said to have acted with poor judgment in the manner in which he first interacted with Brown, or in pursuing Brown after the incident at the SUV. These are matters of policy and procedure that do not rise to the level of a Constitutional violation and thus cannot support a criminal prosecution. Cf. Gardner v. Howard, 109 F.3d 427, 430–31 (8th Cir. 1997) (violation of internal policies and procedures does not in and of itself rise to violation of Constitution). Because Wilson did not act with the requisite criminal intent, it cannot be proven beyond reasonable doubt to a jury that he violated 18 U.S.C.§ 242 when he fired his weapon at Brown.

Conclusion For the reasons set forth above, this matter lacks prosecutive merit and should be closed.}}

* '''additional details or expand''' The report repeatedly and unambiguously says that the evidence and credible witnesses supported wilson, and that contrary witnesses were not credible and contradicted evidence.

Should we rename all current six Star Wars films to Star Wars Episode X: Subtitle form (i.e Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi) or move them all to just the subtitle form (i.e. The Phantom Menace) and make the opening lines for the pages something such as the way I have proposed below? Thank you for your time!

This request for comment is not brief, sorry. It happens.

I say, either of these ways will do.
<br>
# Move all pages to ''Star Wars Episode X: Subtitle''
<br>
OR
<br>
#Move ''[[Star Wars (film)]]'' to ''A New Hope'', ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' to ''The Phantom Menace'', ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' to ''Attack of the Clones'', and ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'' to ''Revenge of the Sith''.  Then, make the opening lines for the pages something like this:<br>

The reason I came up with this idea is because we clearly have done this sort of thing with other pages such as [[The Avengers (2012 film)]] where the actual name, ''Marvel's The Avengers'' is followed by its other common name ''The Avengers''.  In this Star Wars case, people who believe the common name is not with the episode title are satisfied, and the people who believe the full title is the common name are satisfied because the articles introduce the topic by the official name (which again, people would argue is also the common name) and says the shorter "common" names in the same introduction sentence.  This third choice I have suggested would also eliminate the recent discussion about whether using ''Star Wars: Episode X – Subtitle'' or ''Star Wars Episode X: Subtitle'' for the prequels since articles would now just link to the subtitle and they wouldn't have to worry about writing the episode name correctly in the pipe linking or whatever. And face, you know damn well these titles (baring Episode VII, which who the hell knows if Abrams is going to be like "oh yeah, let's call it Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens" officially) are officially titled and sold under the title written as '''''Star Wars: Episode X – Subtitle'''''. (Unless you want to write it as ''Star Wars: Episode X: Subtitle'' or ''Star Wars, Episode X: Subtitle'', but we can all agree these alternate ways looks really odd as $h!+, commas look odd in this case and two colons looks like just no.)

{{rfcquote|text=
I am starting an RfC based on a suggestion above. The results legend currently uses a set of colours to distinguish between individual results in results matrices, such as those that appear in season articles, like [[2014 Formula One season]]. The legend uses blue to represent non-points finishes and purple to represent retirements. However, I feel that this arrangement has the potential to be difficult to read for people who are red/blue colour-blind. I myself am red/green colour-blind, and sometimes find it difficult to distinguish between individual results in a large matrix. The individual cells do have the result (ie 14 for a non-points finish, or Ret for a retirement) written in black, but I do not think that thus goes far enough. Lately the project has emphasised improving the readability for as many users as possible, and with that in mind, I propose changing the colours slightly. As this represents a major change, it would need a consensus from the community, but with very few people having any experience with colour-blindness (I am the only one that I know of), I have opened it up to RfC.

What I propose is changing the colour for non-points finishes to a light blue. As light blue is used elsewhere in the results matrices (albeit very infrequently), I further propose changing it to another colour (perhaps swap with the existing darker blue currently used for non-points finishes).

{{rfcquote|text=
Today I would like to bring to the attention of the community an article that just today failed GAN, [[Bikini]], and why this article's experience at GAN leads me to believe that the following element of the GA [[Wikipedia:Good article nominations/Instructions|review criteria]]:
{{quote|Note that the standard holding time is seven days; however, reviewers can shorten/extend the time limit if they wish.}}
Needs to be modified.

This article failed its [[Talk:Bikini/GA1|first GA nomination]] in January of 2014 under the authorship of [[User:Azx2|Azx2]] for important structural reasons that were never addressed during the review; nonetheless despite [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bikini/GA1&action=history minimal] activity on the page I think it is important to point out that long-time reviewer [[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] started the review on 16 December 2013 and did not finally fail the article until 11 January 2014, a period of just under a month. This is an advisable level of discretion that I have also attempted to practice in my own reviews and have indeed come to expect from my reviewers as well.

For instance, when I [[Talk:Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles/GA1|reviewed]] [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles]] also in January 2014 nominator [[User:EnigmaMcmxc|EnigmaMcmxc]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AArticle_231_of_the_Treaty_of_Versailles%2FGA1&diff=588407986&oldid=588149339 stated] that "I am currently suffering from the flu. Is it possible for the deadline to be extended by about a week, until I am feeling better and able to work on the recommendations and the article?". My immediate reply was to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Article_231_of_the_Treaty_of_Versailles/GA1&diff=next&oldid=588407986 assure him] that "Take what time you need, I've always seen "two weeks" as more a suggestion than a rule." Later on the situation reversed itself; I was unavailable to finish the review and it was Enigma's turn to wait the week that was necessary for me to unbury myself. End result: the article passed GA. Everyone wins.

As you all know, GAN has an enormous and almost consistently-growing backlog of articles to review and as a result a lot of the article that are put up for GA review have been listed for months or more. In the intervening time a lot of things can happen IRL that take an editor's attention away from Wikipedia. Another example: in 2010 [[User:Casliber|Casliber]], another superlatively experienced editor, began reviewing ''my'' nomination at the time, [[Davidson Seamount]]. The original review came down on the 6th of February; my [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ADavidson_Seamount%2FGA1&diff=344729052&oldid=342241980 response] did not come until the 17th&mdash;I had simply not logged into Wikipedia in the intervening time and quite frankly ''forgotten'' I had a nomination listed at all! When I "rediscovered" this fact I very nearly did a flip&mdash;I felt so lucky to have gotten a reviewer who knew the virtues of patience! The rest of the procedure was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Davidson_Seamount/GA1&action=history short and sweet]. End result: article passed GA; everyone wins. 

[[User:Aditya Kabir|Aditya Kabir]] had been working to slowly but consistently bring the [[Bikini]] article up in quality from shortly after it failed its first GA nomination. In June of 2014 he listed his article for peer review; [[Wikipedia:Peer review/Bikini/archive1|I reviewed it]]. All of my points were handled and we've maintained a cordial relationship since then; though I wasn't willing to handle the GA nomination (and didn't think that, having already been involved in a PR, that was advisable) I watched with interest and [[User_talk:Aditya_Kabir#On_.22bikini.22|encouragement]] (something so ''rarely'' seen on here nowadays&mdash;but I digress). He finally felt confident enough to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bikini&oldid=635653987 nominate] the article in November. Between the time that he put it up for review to the time that it was reviewed and placed [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bikini&oldid=649160590 on hold], exactly three months passed (27 November to 27 February). [[User:SNUGGUMS|SNUGGUMS]] was the reviewer, and an [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bikini/GA2&oldid=649335571 initial comment] on the [[Talk:Bikini/GA2|review page]] was "I don't think there's too many problems".

Then the following exchange occurred, which I <big>'''''strongly'''''</big> believe is wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong:

#[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABikini%2FGA2&diff=650024269&oldid=650018746 this has made progress] - S
#[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bikini/GA2&action=history I hope I can address all issues] - Kabir
#[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABikini%2FGA2&diff=650067090&oldid=650064495 So do I. '''You've got 25 hours'''] - S
#[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABikini%2FGA2&diff=650214829&oldid=650067090 Can you please extent the deadline a little bit?] - Kabir (edit summary: please)
#[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bikini/GA2&diff=next&oldid=650214829 '''While this is being failed for now''', but your efforts are commendable and you did well.] [sic] - S (edit summary: failing)
#[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABikini&diff=650226477&oldid=649160590 '''GA Fail''']

My fellow Wikipedians. This is unacceptable. When an editor who is actively working on a nomination asks for an extension to allow them to continue the work they are doing on the article in question, you don't fail the GAN whilst doling out pity in your failing statement; you ought to have no right to do so; you ''ought'' to consider the activity of the editor in question and, gauging the situation, offer whichever length of an extension you deem necessary for the writer to do what they're there to do&mdash;improve the encyclopedia. This ''ought'' to be the way we operate, and it ''ought'' to be what the guidelines say. I don't know how quickly GA reviews were once handled in the past, when this particular element of the nominations procedure was created&mdash;perhaps S even felt generous, he had granted twice the allotted time after all&mdash;but if an editor has to wait ''three '''months''''' for their article to finally be reviewed, the reviewer can wait more than ''one '''week''''' for the necessary work to be finished.

I propose that the guidelines on review length be rewritten to better fit what I believe the situation has always been anyway and always ought to be:
{{quote|Note that there is no standard holding time; reviewers can shorten/extend their time limit as they wish, taking into consideration the level of activity the nomination has generated and whether or not the nominator has asked for an extension given their off-wiki circumstances. The ultimate goal of a good article nomination is a good article&mdash;the reviewer should allow whatever time they believe necessary to allow this to happen.}}

It's furthermore unfair to Kabir that he must wait another expected three months for his article to be reviewed again, and I petition that this review be reopened and the editor given a time extension.

Thank you. <span style="font-family:Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"><b><font color="#333" size="2">[[User:Resident Mario|Res]]</font></b><font color="#444" size="2">[[User_talk:Resident_Mario#top|Mar]]</font></span> 01:29, 8 March 2015 (UTC)}}

So I think we all know this page needs some help. It is way to big and confusing. Here is an idea I had. Anyone with actual knowledge of the fire service knows that the terms "fire engine" and "fire truck" are NOT interchangeable! A truck has some sort of aerial ladder or platform. What do people think about pulling all of the aerial apparatus out to their own page ([[fire truck]]). This page would still have an "Aerial apparatus" section but it would just have 2-3 sentences saying this is what distinguishes a TRUCK from an ENGINE, then directing you to the [[fire truck]] page. For example, look at the section on [[Fire_engine#Aircraft|Aircraft]]. One sentence and a 'Main Article:' link, or [[Fire_engine#Fireboat|Fireboat]].

Per recent discussions at [[WT:RD]] it seems clear that this policy does not have consensus.  See for example [[Wikipedia talk:Reference desk#What is wrong with this?|this recent discussion]] or discussions [[Wikipedia talk:Reference desk/Guidelines/Medical advice|here]].  Wikipedia policy should reflect consensus, and it is clear that there is no consensus to support the prohibition against giving medical advice.  I am asking for an RFC to deprecate this policy, and related pages, including [[Wikipedia:Reference desk/Guidelines/Medical advice]].

I don't really care personally one way or the other, but if the community doesn't support this policy, it should be deprecated.  If the community does support this policy, then we should enforce it.

At most recent edit the ideologies were edited to/down to:
*Salafist jihadism
*Salafism[6][7]
Editor comment would be welcome on this but I '''suggest''' that a content might be:
* [[Sunni Islam]]
* [[Salafism]]/[[Wahhabism]]
* [[Takfirism]]
I also provisionally think that the selectivity of "facism" has a great relevance, so also:
* [[Facism]]

I think that justification for inclusion of "Salafism" may be weak.  I don't think that there is justification for inclusion of "Salafist Jihadism" which is a neologism and which, in any case, seems to me to be synonymous with "Salafism" and "Wahhabism".  Despite the fact that one of the clear drives within the group has been to engage with proponent of Shia Islam, I don't think that a reference to Anti-Shiaism is supported.  However, given the context of its religious cleansing and persecution of people who do not share the groups Sunni based philosophies, I think that a reference to "Sunni Islam" is warranted.

I thought to raise the subject here to hopefully protect the content from [[wp:tendentious]] editing.  If it is possible to establish the relevance of the ideologies here I don't see that there would be relevance of including source references to the content in the article.  The validity of one of the ideological references is not increased because an editor has found that a particular source has made that reference to the group.

'''Propose''' adding myth and mythology to the content on "words to watch" in [[WP:LABEL]] in regard to all uses of the word.  I don't intend by this that the words be excluded from use but just, if alternative presentations can be given, then these should be considered.  This is in line with the general spirit of the article which begins with the text: "There are [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not censored|no forbidden words or expressions on Wikipedia]], but certain expressions should be used with care, because they may introduce bias."  

At present the text of [[WP:LABEL]] begins, "[[Value-laden]] labels ... may express contentious opinion and are best avoided unless widely used by reliable sources to describe the subject, in which case use [[WP:INTEXT|in-text attribution]]."

In the thread immediately above I have suggested that this can read, "[[Value-laden]] labels ... may express contentious opinion and [''may be''] best avoided unless widely used by reliable sources to describe the subject, in which case use [[WP:INTEXT|in-text attribution]]."

This proposal follows a long discussion at: [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Religion#Disambiguations of divinities]] in which continued and unanimous opposition was given to the use of the disambiguation "... (mythology)".

The problem here is perceived [[WP:SYSTEMICBIAS]] in which present day faiths seem to be automatically classified as "religions", "faiths" etc. while previously practised faiths get regularly classified as "myths" and "mythologies".  Words like "folklore" regularly don't even get a look in.  My contention is that practitioners of present day religions have established bias by being instrumental in developing the description of prior forms of belief as myth.  

According to the online Oxford dictionary definition of: [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/myth myth,] there seems to be no major problem with the first definition.  
:1. A traditional story, especially one concerning the early history of a people or explaining a natural or social phenomenon, and typically involving supernatural beings or events:
If this was viewed in isolation there might be no problem as the word might be considered to neutrally present a ''narrative'' on a religious theme.  I am not sure when or how the second definition definition was developed/was first used but I consider this to present the problem.
:2. A widely held but false belief or idea:
The result, I think, is that present day religions are falsely differentiated from previous faiths.  

I think that the problem here goes far beyond a mere [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Expressions_of_doubt|#Expression of doubt]] but that the usage goes as far as to [[WP:ASSERT]] falsity when the same stance is not adopted with present day faiths.  See the articles [[Creation myth]] (which I am not necessarily arguing against) and [[Genesis creation narrative]] for examples of this.  

A positive way forward I think would be actions such as to favour links such articles as [[Ancient Greek religion]] as opposed to [[Greek mythology]].  This, I think, would reduce current discrepancy.

I will notify the religion and mythology wikiprojects of this discussion.  [[User:GregKaye|Greg]][[User talk:GregKaye|Kaye]] 11:47, 16 March 2015 (UTC)}}

*Regarding the discussion above I suggest that an additional shortcut be added to this section as: [[WP:W2WTERRORIST]] which would then change the listing of shortcuts for the section to read: [[WP:LABEL]] [[WP:TERRORIST]] [[WP:W2WTERRORIST]].
*Changing the text from saying "Value-laden labels ... are best avoided" to saying "Value-laden labels ... may be best avoided" 
*Changing the title from "Contentious labels" to "Descriptions that can be used as contentious labels"
My view is that this section (in a content on a page entitled "words to watch" and which begins with the statement "There are [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not censored|no forbidden words or expressions on Wikipedia]]") is unnecessarily and unhelpfully proscriptive.  It is also contradictory saying that there are no forbidden words and then labelling a certain set of adjectives as "labels" and stating that they are best avoided.  For instance I would have no problem in describing, say, Nazi philosophy and motivations as being "racist".  In a slightly more contentious topic there is currently a discussion at [[Talk:ISIL]] on the use of the use of the widely used description "extremist" in the lead.  In other cases I think that various topics might be described as fundamentalist without any form of slur being offered.  In fact in some cases, and depending on the nature of the true fundamentals of the topic, this particular wording might well present them in an unrepresentationally favourable light.  In the specific title [[The Beatles (terrorist cell)]] I think that its least problematic part is the terrorist reference.  The four individuals concerned are not [[The Beatles]] and there is no evidence that I know of that the four of them act as an individual cell and on this basis I have requested an article move to the title [[ISIL militants nicknamed the Beatles]] with discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Beatles_(terrorist_cell)#Requested_move_7_March_2015 here.]  Otherwise I think that the terrorist description is arguably very apt as, to my interpretation, it has been the videoed [[Killing of captives by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|killing of captives]] including aid workers that largely substantiated ISIL's international designations as a terrorist organization.  

I think that it is very fair that the words mentioned be categorised as "words to watch" but I think that it would be wrong to be prescriptive in our approach.  My worry though is that, in a minority of cases, we may lose our ability to give pithy descriptions of topics.  Our main priority is to build an informative [[encyclopaedia]] and, IMO, not necessarily to pander to any [[politically correct]] agenda.

We should mention the method most used first. I personally think the  refToolbar is great but as a contributor to the help desks.....I see that refToolbar is another thing people have to learn. I believe knowing the very basics first is more helpful in the long run over telling new editors to use templates  that need to be filled out. Wikipedia permits editors to use any citation system that allows the reader to understand where the information came from. We should not assume all like the tools and will use them off the bat....we should give  the basic info first.... by telling people what the code looks..and where it can be found...then talk about the tools and other methods available.  Leavening people in the dark about what the code looks like and does is not helpful in the long run. People dont need to learn all the  HTML code just {{tag|ref|content=}} before they learn more . As of now we  talk about  how with refToolbar editors should remove the reftags for a bib before we even explain what the code is for...again putting the the cart before the horse.  -- [[User:Moxy|Moxy]] ([[User talk:Moxy|talk]]) 16:07, 13 March 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
An anonymous user, or possibly a small group of anonymous users, has repeatedly deleted the paragraph discussing the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]] that occurred near Littleton from this page's History section. Going by their edit summaries, it appears they feel that referencing the incident somehow promotes it.

I disagree, and I think the paragraph on the shootings should remain. Although the incident technically occurred in neighboring [[Columbine, Colorado]] (which has a Littleton ZIP code), it did draw national attention to Littleton and is thus relevant to the Littleton page's History section. To be fair, the paragraph in question has no citation.

I didn't author the reference to the shootings, but I am concerned that allowing its deletion on the grounds that it irritates another editor would set a bad precedent.

So, in the interest of defusing an edit war, I'm requesting comment from the editor community:  should the paragraph referencing the Columbine shootings remain in the Littleton article or not? [[User:FUBAR007|FUBAR007]] ([[User talk:FUBAR007|talk]]) 19:40, 13 March 2015 (UTC)}}

I've noticed a growing trend on Wikipedia which diverges from our initial goals with a dangerous precedence being set. Our goal is to document the world based on verfiability and notability. It is here that we have the right to document the unusual apart from the usual with a neutral point of view. Mainstream acceptance has '''never''' been a requirement, while this social phenomenon is unusual to rare there are enough secondary reliable sources to deem it notable. I feel in many ways the previous close was against consensus. We have the term '''no consensus''' for a reason such as this case when there is no consensus. The ensuing dispute only emphasizes the lack of consensus.

Upon reviewing the sources, this topic has been covered both academically and by mainstream media including a documented shooting which the perpetrator directly specified incelism as a motivate. I've added an additional six citations to tokyogirl's version the argument that this lacks notability or is not a social condition simply does not hold. I am requesting that the current version be moved to the mainspace.

Currently, this episode list shows what each episode title is making a reference to by providing a link to corresponding Wikipedia articles. But many will think that those blue links are directing to articles about each PSG episodes, and most will have no idea if the episode title is a reference to the Japanese title of the subject (like ''Help!'' and ''The Mummy'').

# Give an explanation at the "Aux1" field for each episode.
# Do it, instead at the end of episode description.

We appear to be at a deadlock of the definition of city proper within this article and the grounds for inclusion of some of the cities and data in it. This [[UNICEF]] document here: http://www.unicef.org/sowc2012/pdfs/SOWC-2012-DEFINITIONS.pdf simply defines a city proper as " The population living within the administrative boundaries of a city e.g [[Washington, D.C.]] because city boundaries do not regularly adapt to accommodate population increases, the concepts of Urban [[Agglomerations|Agglomeration]] or [[Metropolitan area|Metropolitan Area]] are often used to improve the comparability of measurements of city populations across countries and over time" UNICEF (2012), However different countries apply different definitions previous discussions as shown above included counter arguments  for including Chinese cities in the list based on this Chinese expert's views on the subject " [http://faculty.washington.edu/kwchan/ Professor Kam Wing Chan University of Washington] in the United States, who has made a career out of correcting people's exaggerated claims about Chinese population statistics, explains that what China calls a municipality or city is better understood as a province. Many of the 30 million people who are said to live in the city of Chongqing are actually agricultural workers living in a rural setting, in fact, he says, the area is so huge it's about the size of Austria. 'Doom and gloom' "And if you were to travel from the downtown area to some of the peripheral areas where those 30 million live, it might take a day or two because the road conditions are not that good. So, this cannot be possibly called a city. Because when we call a place a city the general understanding is that we're talking about a commuting zone." Professor Chan calculates that a more reasonable estimate of the urban population of Chongqing is six or seven million. The largest city in China is actually Shanghai. It is commonly thought to have a population of 20 million, but Professor Chan thinks 16 million is a better estimate. He says everyone just loves to think China's cities are bigger than they actually are. He has even had to correct fellow experts at a world conference on global megacities of the future".

Since 2012 this has been tagged with regard to "The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with USA and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject.

There has been a recent shift toward moving professional esports players name to their "gamer tag". I believe this to be both inefficient and improper. A guideline needs to be established so that all esports players should be listed under common birth name for two primary reasons:

*Players can change their gamer tags
*Players may choose inappropriate tags or name which they may regret.

The second issue is same names for esports players should be label (electronic sports player) instead of (professional gamer) as the latter can refer to [[gambling]] as well.

I have noticed some contradictions on and across several pages relating to the taxonomic classification of Chimpanzees. In essence some pages use the system where Homininae split into Gorillini and Hominini and then Hominini divides into Hominina and Panina. Other pages use a system where Homininae trifurcates into Gorillini, Hominini and Panini. Several pages use both in different Parts. (Chimpanzee lists Chimpanzees as Hominini in the lede but Panini in the infobox). I can't find sources detailing a controversy or an overturn of the historic system. Which should be used and can I get some help making the pages consistent?

Affected Pages:
[[Hominini]], [[Sahelanthropus]], [[Homininae]], [[Chimpanzee-human last common ancestor]], [[Ape]],

I believe that the criteria for what constitutes a Bond girl seems to be skirting awfully close to violating both the [[Wikipedia:No original research|WP:OR]] and [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|WP:V]] rules. It is cited nowhere within the article that a Bond girl must be James Bond's love interest. The criteria that a Bond girl is only James Bond's love interest seems to be rather limiting because it would imply that the lead female character of ''[[Quantum of Solace (film)|Quantum of Solace]]'', [[Camille Montes]] played by [[Olga Kurylenko]], is not a Bond girl simply because her relationship with James Bond is platonic. I believe that there should be more citations from outside sources before we dictate that a Bond girl is ONLY a love interest of James Bond.[[User:TheLastAmigo|TheLastAmigo]] ([[User talk:TheLastAmigo|talk]]) 17:46, 21 March 2015 (UTC)}}

With regard to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiBullying&diff=652805957&oldid=652804431 this version] of the WP:Bully page, one argument is that the previous version has a clearer lead and the new version has a poor lead and misinterprets how parts of Wikipedia is supposed to work; the other argument is that the new version is "Some clean up of phrasing and structure but an IMPORTANT addition of Flippant content edits category of wikibully." For more details on this, see the short [[#Recent changes to the essay]] section above.  
 
On a side note: I clearly know that this is a [[WP:Essay]]; but since it states that the essay is "is intended to supplement the [[Wikipedia:Civility]] and [[Wikipedia:Ownership of articles]] policies, to which editors should defer in case of inconsistency between that page and this one," I tagged the WP:RfC with "rfc|policy" in addition to "rfc|proj."

{{ping|I dream of horses|Byronmercury|Amatulic|Hugetim|Warko|Unbuttered Parsnip|Y-S.Ko|Hendrick 99}} How to improve article navigation, what to remove and what to keep?

I have brought this to RfC because I think we need a methodical way to improve the navigation of the article. Ways of improving navigation include-

* Removal of sections
* Making sections more concise
* Grouping sections into general themes (currently there are about 42 main headings in the article)

If we are removing and grouping its good to use references to guide us. I've found two candidates, are there any others?

Editors making revisions based on fandom and not facts.  Black Cat, a woman wearing a low cut, black body suit who used cables to climb buildings and steal (cat burglaries) first appeared on July, 1979 and immediately started a mutual romantic relationship (dating) with Spider-man.  Up to that 1979 date, Catwoman had appeared in comics wearing purple dress, committed bank robberies, had a CatCar and pet lions.  Editor continues to suggest Black Cat was based on Catwoman (calling creator,Wolfman, a liar?) when Catwoman did not adopt a similar attire until 1987 (Frank Miller Year One).  Simply compare how Black Cat and Catwoman were seen in comics in 1979 and how they are represented now.  Please comment

*Comment While the comparison is natural, possibly charged with energy overflowing from the DC vs Marvel fight, I think its completely inappropriate to comment in this article on any connection between the two characters without ''substantial'' evidence. And as was mentioned in the original RFC, the characters show little to no resemblance outside of sharing the profession of being cat burglars. Black Cat first appearance here <ref>http://s112.photobucket.com/user/wilblas/media/009-12.jpg.html</ref> vs Catwoman first appearance here: <ref>https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/9f/2d/04/9f2d04fdf3be323af33a9e6ac53053e4.jpg</ref> It seems to me that the argument is baseless as it would also assume that all cat burglar themed characters post Catwoman would then be considered rip-off characters. Side note: I do find it kind of interesting that the cover of Detective Comics 122 calls Catwoman's crime spree "The Black Cat Crimes!"

Often, new page patrollers hastily tag articles for speedy deletion without giving creators time to improve the article. I must admit that I have done this myself, but in light of [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)#Discouraging biting the newbies|this thread at the Village Pump]], I no longer intend to do that. I propose that we create a "wait" notice, which we can put on articles when a patroller tags an article too quickly. Obviously, this tag would not apply to articles that must be deleted immediately, such as hoaxes, attacks, etc. The tag would tell patrollers to wait for a set period of time before tagging the article, so as to allow time for improvement. The details on what the period of time would be can be discussed later, but all I want now is to see if there would be general consensus for such a notice. We could then tell the creator about the concerns with the page. I've created a possible template for that [[User:Biblioworm/DeletionWelcome|here]]; it's intended to be a friendly-sounding template with room for personalization.

As discussed above, the patent document lists L. Ron Hubbard as the sole inventor of the second version of the e-meter. (The first version was by Mathison; nobody disputes this.) The book by Bent Corydon, ''[[L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?]]'', names two others, Don Breeding and Joe Wallis, who developed the second version of the e-meter and presented it to Hubbard prior to Hubbard patenting it. Which of the following paths is best?
*'''1:''' State in Wikipedia's voice that Breeding and Wallis developed the e-meter, with Hubbard subsequently patenting their work.
*'''2:''' State that Hubbard patented the e-meter, then attribute to Corydon the assertion that Breeding and Wallis developed it. 
*'''3:''' Remove any mention of Breeding and Wallis.

'''Discussion'''

*'''1'''. The Corydon book is a [[WP:SECONDARY]] source, the kind of source that Wikipedia greatly prefers. The patent documents are a primary source and cannot be used to contradict the secondary source. There is no source, primary, secondary or otherwise, that says Breeding and Wallis ''did not'' develop the e-meter. Nor are there any sources that describe Hubbard carefully testing components and circuitry to develop the second version of the e-meter.

From my point of view it notable Marxian concept worthy of its own article. The section on Capitalism has its own problems (article is probably too long as a sub section, and it needs more sources).

To my fellow editors. This is a forty five year old high school, in affluent community, ([[Newport Beach, California]]) that, over the last 5 years has had some coverage and legal issue that have been uncovered. First let me disclose that I once went to this school, in 1976-1979 & took all three photos, so my COI has been disclosed but another editor seems to have drafted a version that contains more on the negative aspects of the location, then on its true 45 year history or the facility itself. I can attest to the fact that in many ways things have not changed as the school is truly a reflection of the community but that aside, should the lead contain the issues as noted above by editor {{ping|DaltonHird}} and have the perception of a dysfunctional school, in the lead.

At the [[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/2013 elections|2013 FLC elections]] two editors—{{user|Crisco 1492}} and {{user|SchroCat}}—were appointed to become FL delegates. They joined the FL director {{user|Giants2008}}, and two editors {{user|Hahc21}} and {{user|NapHit}}, albeit with the long-term unavailability of NapHit. Since then, Hahc21 has also ceased to act as a delegate, and those overseeing FLs—their [[WP:FLC|promotion]], [[WP:FLRC|delisting]], and [[WP:TFL|appearance on the front page]]—have been reduced to three. It is now time to consider adding another delegate to bring the number back to four.

In the 2013 election the third placed candidate, with ten supporting votes and no opposes was {{user|PresN}}, and '''it is proposed that PresN is promoted to the role of FL delegate'''.

'''Timescale''': All comments are invited on this proposal, which will run until ''23:59, 26 April 2015'', UTC. – [[User:SchroCat|SchroCat]] ([[User talk:SchroCat|talk]]) 08:33, 16 April 2015 (UTC)}}

As you can see at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Abhay Vidhya Mandir Senior Secondary School, Hindaun City]] there are 2(3 if the speedy counts) votes for delete, one vote for keep, and two for keep because of precedent.

I'm proposing we drop the idea of precedent for precedent's sake.

A school existing should not be a reason to have an article on it. It should have to be notable, just like everything else on here. This seems like a really strange exception to me. While I understand precedent, I feel that it should only ever be used to end something quickly, or if there is no consensus reached. Right now when the AfD closes it would be deleted if not for the votes for precedent. If on the other hand there was no consensus then the closing admin could use precedent to close as keep. In the legal system a judge uses precedent as a guide, not a rule. We should do the same here. [[User:Jerodlycett|Jerodlycett]] ([[User talk:Jerodlycett|talk]]) 04:19, 30 March 2015 (UTC)}}

A [[User:Blueboar|user]] has proposed the creation of a "style noticeboard" ([[Wikipedia:Style noticeboard]]) at [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style|the MoS talk page]], similar to the likes of the [[WP:RS/N|reliable sources noticeboard]]. He described the noticeboard in this manner: "a place where editors can raise and discuss specific situations, and get opinions on how to interpret the policy or guideline in the context of those specific situations". Such a noticeboard does not currently exist, and style issues are dealt with across a wide variety of labyrinthine MoS pages. The goal of the noticeboard is to allow for the centralised discussion of specific style issues at specific articles, so that users can come to consensus on how to interpret a specific piece of style guidance in our policies and guidelines, such as [[WP:AT]] and [[WP:MOS]]. Should such a noticeboard be created?

{{rfcquote|text=
There are maybe four valid reasons I can think of for not wanting to move an image to Commons: (1) There is a licensing reason (usually that it is PD in the US, but copyrighted in its home country and so Commons will not accept it, this would also apply to cases where there are questions about the uploader's respect for copyright and the image is tagged with {{tl|File at CCI}}).  (2) The image is only for a user's user page or for a local discussion with no conceivable encyclopedic use on any other project.  (3) The image is high-risk and we need it to have the benefit of our cascading protection.  (4) There is substantial history and it is beneficial to preserve that history.

[[:Category:Wikipedia files on Wikimedia Commons for which a local copy has been requested to be kept]] now has an ungodly number of images in it.  Some of them are for legitimate licensing reasons, but a lot are more for "I don't like Commons and I want to [[WP:OWN]] my contributions" reasons.

So my proposal is this: I propose to amend "The image is not marked as <nowiki>{{Do not move to Commons}} or as {{Keep local}}</nowiki>" to add the requirement that one of the above four reasons be the case. 

For something like this - [[:File:Baseball (crop).jpg]] - a high-risk image that is used all over creation - keeping a local copy makes sense.  But then there are others, like [[:File:Her Majesty Sultanah Terengganu Tuanku Nur Zahirah.jpg]], which is not even a user-authored image.  It's a Flickr image and 100% '''SHOULD''' be moved to Commons where they have a Flickr review process in place.  Or something like [[:File:Hickory smoked barbecue bacon.jpg]] or [[:File:Hi flowerchip!.jpg]], which could be useful to other projects and there's no reason whatsoever to retain the local image once it's moved.  --[[User:B|B]] ([[User talk:B|talk]]) 05:49, 30 March 2015 (UTC)}}

There is a debate over whether the [[WP:TITLE|title]] of the article should be moved to [[Biharis in Bangladesh]]. Previously, the title was moved to Biharis in Bangladesh as per [[WP:BOLD]] but this was reverted and two users currently believe the former title [[Stranded Pakistanis]] should be retained. There is a contention over the latter title as it contended that: 
# These migrants are predominately [[Bihari people]] who migrated to [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]) during the [[Partition of India|partition]] in 1947. They have been living in present-day Bangladesh since 1947, including after the 1971 war which rendered them stateless.
# Stranded Pakistanis is an outdated, vague, unclear and [[value-laden]] label used by some in Bangladesh to refer to ethnic Biharis who remained loyal to Pakistan during the [[1971 Bangladesh war]]. Following the war, these people remained [[stateless]]. In 2008, the court of Bangladesh ruled on granting Bangladeshi citizenship to hundreds of thousands of Biharis belonging to the new generation post-1971. Hence, the title [[Biharis in Bangladesh]] is [[WP:NPOV|neutral]], accurate, and does not carry political connotations which the label "Stranded Pakistani" does. It is inclusive of all Biharis, whether those with Bangladeshi citizenship or those who are stateless (Stranded Pakistanis is not inclusive of either group, let alone the community). 
# Apart from a few hundred thousand Biharis that were repatriated to Pakistan, a large number remain behind in Bangladesh. The Pakistani government has not provided those who remain in Bangladesh [[Pakistani citizenship]] which would legally render them as nationals of Pakistan. Instead, the Pakistani government has rendered the stateless Biharis a responsibility of Bangladesh [http://tribune.com.pk/story/861364/stranded-pakistanis-in-bangladesh-not-pakistans-responsibility-fo-tells-sc/]
# The [[Talk:Stranded Pakistanis#Sources using the term Bihari|vast majority of sources on the subject]] describe the community as Biharis while Stranded Pakistanis has a very limited usage in sources (usually as an alternative term or when discussing the legal status of the community). [[WP:COMMONNAME]] requires that the terminology most widely used in sources should be the title of the article.

There is [[List of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel]] and there is [[List of Israeli attacks on the Gaza strip]]. There are other similar lists and separate articles on different violent (or otherwise related to conflict) events.
This structure doesn't let one track the connection between the separate events. Often an action by one side is declared to be a reaction to an action by the other side, and when we list them separately it's hard to provide the  context.

One solution is to add context for each of the attacks on their own articles/lists - but it would cause repetition and allow for [[WP:POVFORK]]s, since the same event can be described differently in different articles.
Another solution that I'm considering is to merge these lists and split them by time rather than by side - so there is a timeline article for each year, listing all the major events in that year in the order they happened, noting when one event was declared to be caused by another (by either side or by outside analysts) , wikilinking to complete articles when they exist.

'''''Let's stop the war and try to settle for a list of people in the collage'''''.

'''Proposal'''

Recently couple of editors have turned to each other with a long fight over whom to put in the collage and whom not. Arguably this list can contain some (5*6=) 30 people. They have to be very representative of Bengali people, including Bengali people from Bangladesh, West Bengal and abroad; people from history and from today; including politicians, artists and scientists. So lets '''discuss''' before making anymore inconsistent edits.

Let us try to fill in the gaps with some categorized distribution. I propose following estimate:
* Bangladesh: 12~13, West Bengal: 12~13, Abroad: 4~6
* Ancient (Before ~1800): 3~4, Renaissance/British Raj (1800~1950): 10~13, Post colonial and Modern (1950~Today): 13~17
* Nobel laureates:3. Leaders (Social   and political): 5~6,World Famous Entertainers: 4~5, Athletes with world records or victory in world championships not just local matches: 4~5, scientists/academicians: 4~5, Authors whose works are adapted into movies/translated into non-bengali languages/have got Booker Prize/Nobel Prize: 4~5,  Artists with international fame: 3~4, Others: 5~8.

My attempts to transform this into something remotely encyclopedic have been  [[WP:OWN|repeatedly reverted]] by someone who seems to only edit similar articles on tech executives.  (paid editor? PR?)

In addition to the overall tone of this article, the off-topic info on companies this guy worked for should be stripped out.  For example listing Wiredset's clients here is absurd.  Similarly absurd is name-dropping "artists he worked with" at Sony.

So, [[WP:OPENPARA]] currently states that "Ethnicity or sexuality should not generally be emphasized in the opening unless it is relevant to the subject's notability. Similarly, previous nationalities or the country of birth should not be mentioned in the opening sentence unless they are relevant to the subject's notability." This feels highly reductionist and very limited. It's possible for somebody to be notable, generally, and their ethnicity or sexuality to be a prominent contextual element for understanding their work.

A good example of this is artists; there are a lot of artists who have an ethnicity and a nationality; say, Chinese-American or African-American. Their ethnicity is not part of their ''notability'': they are notable as artists. But it is important in understanding the context in which they work. When you have an artist who is a first generation Chinese-American and their work is centred on that identity...sure, they're notable without it. But it's pretty much impossible to understand the work they do, or why they do it, or what it refers to, without also understanding their background.

I'd like to propose amending the guidelines around the opening paragraph, specifically, changing:

{{quote|Ethnicity or sexuality should not generally be emphasized in the opening unless it is relevant to the subject's notability. Similarly, previous nationalities or the country of birth should not be mentioned in the opening sentence unless they are relevant to the subject's notability.}}

to:

{{quote|Ethnicity or sexuality should not generally be emphasized in the opening unless it is relevant to the subject's notability, ''''or provides important context to understanding the subject or their work'''. Similarly, previous nationalities or the country of birth should not be mentioned in the opening sentence '''unless they meet the same standard'''.}}

<big>'''Context:'''</big>
Some countries recognize some languages of traditional minority ethnic communities as co-official languages. This status generally includes right to equal use of some language at local/regional/state level plus public authorities and governments use minority language in equal scope in its work (documents, road signs, other materials...). You might take a look at these article: [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]...
<big>'''Question:'''</big>
I recently had an editorial conflict regarding the addition of minority languages names into articles about municipalities that officially introduced minority co-official language. My idea is that when there are sources that certain (local) government had introduced additional minority coofficial language, we should add name of that village or town in minority language in article lead section, infobox and name/language section if there is one. Is there a common Wikipedia practice in such cases and if there is not what is your opinion as members of Wikipedia community?--[[User:MirkoS18|MirkoS18]] ([[User talk:MirkoS18|talk]]) 20:44, 4 April 2015 (UTC)}}

The [[WP:RM]] discussion being cited was attended by almost no one, and is not authoritative anyway. [[WP:AT]] policy does not rely upon RM "precedents", especially very weak ones like that. Consensus is decided here based on what makes the most sense for our readers and editors, and there appear to be no extant objections to this form of disambiguation being used in cases where consensus determines it to be the best choice, so a defensive "citation" of this sort doesn't serve any purpose anyway. Most examples used on this page probably have a RM record on their talk pages, and anyone who cares about such an example can go look; we don't need to explicitly point them there, especially in such a redundant way. <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 17:42, 29 April 2015 (UTC)}}

Howdy.
 
So I have had nothing but trouble trying to get this article going. I asked to have a discussion on the tp before further action was taken, but that was ignored so I'll do it. Looking at [[WP:TOOSOON]], the article does meet the necessary requirements. It has been widely covered by the media, there is an event being planned and Huckabee is certainly a notable guy. I think this is more a matter of [[WP:ITJ]]- the article is a stub (and it's difficult to lengthen it when it's constantly being sent back to a revert) and it certainly needs improvement prior to the announcement. But I don't think we would have to have the discussion if the article were longer. The next relevant policy, [[WP:UPANDCOMING]], also does not count for this article. I'm not saying "this will be a big thing"- it is a big thing. And, yeah, if we delete it now, we WILL absolutely, without a doubt need to bring it back in about 2 weeks, but there is more to it. We will be missing out on a good deal of important coverage. We also need to consider what we've done in the past. With both [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign,_2016&oldid=656160574Hillary Clinton] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marco_Rubio_presidential_campaign,_2016&oldid=656382679Marco Rubio], we created articles almost as soon as word of announcement came and there were already pretty large articles before the announcement. There were well-viewed and it was important to have that foundation.
 
Finally, I would like to apologize. Without realizing it, I broke the [[WP:3RR]]. I didn't think about it until I looked at the article's history just now. Now, all of everything considered, what should we do? Should we keep the article or redirect? [[User:PrairieKid|PrairieKid]] ([[User talk:PrairieKid|talk]]) 16:48, 19 April 2015 (UTC)}}

[[User:Sabahudin9]], you said that the claim that the poem was Bosnian was sourced with [http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Bosnia-Erzegovina/Il-volto-di-Santic-140066 this] source. Even though my knowledge of Italian language is basic, I can still say that this source doesn't support that claim at all.

{{quotation|''Sia le autorità che i cittadini di buona volontà sono d’accordo che quell'immagine bronzea, testimone del bene e del male umano, trovi il suo posto nella stanza di Šantić, il luogo dove il poeta trascorse gli ultimi anni della sua vita, all'interno della “Ćorovića kuća”.''

''Vicino al parco e alla “Ćorovića kuća”, dal 2010 si trova anche il monumento “Emina”, opera dello scultore Zlatko Dizdarević Buco, cittadino di Velika Kladuša, nel nord-ovest della Bosnia. Il monumento trae ispirazione dalla celebre poesia che Aleksa Šantić dedicò ad una ragazza musulmana, una sua vicina. La poesia divenne negli anni il testo di una ancora più celebre sevdalinka, canzone popolare bosniaca, e più in generale della convivenza pacifica e della avversione al nazionalismo. Secondo Zlatko Dizdarević Buco, l’artista che ha donato l'opera a Mostar con l'aiuto dell'amministrazione della città, la statua esprime l’idea della bellezza universale.''}}

Where does it say that it is a Bosnian poem?

I was looking at some of the Bollywood's list of awards and nominations and found so many unnecessary awards list such as of Tabu, Urmila Matondkar, Asin, Anil Kapoor and lots more. These list have few awards listed. I don't think these pages are neccesary. I think they should be merged with their parent article or in the filmography like Kangana Ranaut (awards and role). Lot of western articles are like that, they put all the awards in the biography page itself. {{reply to|Bollyjeff|Ssven2|Vensatry|Kailash29792|Cowlibob}} What you all have to say about this?—[[User talk:Prashant!|<span style="font-variant:small-caps;color:Red">'''Prashant'''</span>]] 11:03, 15 April 2015 (UTC)}}

Presently there is major difference with the layout of wikitables on the desktop site and on the mobile site. Most importantly, the mobile wikitable has no background color for its header cells and its border are brightly colored to the point that they are almost indistinguishable. This creates readability issues for the mobile wikitable. To illustrate this I have made a screenshot of table both in the desktop and the mobile version.
{{Multiple image
 | align      = center
 | direction  = horizontal
 | image1     = Wikitable desktop.png
 | width1     = 450
 | caption1   = A wikitable on the desktop site
 | image2     = Wikitable mobile.png
 | width2     = 450
 | caption2   = The same table on the mobile site
}}
Therefore, I would like to propose the mobile wikitable's layout to be made the same as the desktop wikitable's, so as to have a uniform table style. [[User:Tvx1|T]][[User Talk:Tvx1|v]][[Special:Contributions/Tvx1|x]]1 19:21, 25 April 2015 (UTC)}}

Should this page be redirected or disambiguated?

Disambiguation was removed on the grounds that '''Production, costs, and pricing''' is a primary topic and should be written about. The problem is that the title just a list of three related subjects that can't adequately just be redirected to 'Outline of industrial organization'.

I don't know the history of the page but a lot of pages link here. For example, the
[[Output (economics)]] article has 'produced' -> 'Production, costs, and pricing' -> 'Outline of industrial organization'

'Produced' <> 'Outline of industrial organization'.  Maybe that is just one page that has misused the 'Production, costs, and pricing'.  Or perhaps it is the majority. Hence the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Production,_costs,_and_pricing&oldid=655830870 disambiguation].

Recently the citation templates CS1 and CS2 have removed support for small caps in citations as used by several citation formats such as LSA. The argument was that the MOS does not allow smallcaps in citations. A discussion about including an exception was closed as having consensus to not allow Smallcaps in citations.{{Where}} This means that certain citation styles would not be allowed, which of course goes against both the letter and spirit of WP:CITEVAR. So this requires a discussion of the future of WP:CITEVAR. Therefore I propose an RfC to decide which of the following options to implement:
:A - CITEVAR "you may choose whichever style you think best for the article" should be removed from WP:CITING SOURCES, we do not allow all citation styles only those that are supported by the MOS.
:B - CITEVAR "you may choose whichever style you think best for the article" should be retained and enforced, the MOS should be amended to specifically allow for all citation styles, also those that use smallcaps.
:C - CITEVAR "you may choose whichever style you think best for the article" should be reformulated to specifically exclude those citation styles that use small caps or any other features not supported by the MOS.

'''Survey'''

#'''B'''. CITEVAR has had strong consensus in the past, and there is no pressing need to disallow certain citation styles. It is natural for editors to use the citation styles that are prevalent in their fields and it makes sense that linguistics articles should use LSA style and that citation templates, MOS and policy should provide support for this pluralism.[[User:Maunus|·maunus]] · [[User talk:Maunus|snunɐɯ·]] 18:18, 10 May 2015 (UTC)}}

Should articles that hold to a stricter-than-normal criteria for sources be required to notify editors of this condition for editing?

When editorials from very reputable newspapers are fine in some articles but called "poor sources" in others it strikes me that we need some clarification on the WP:RS policy. How is an editor to know that such sources are acceptable for some articles but are not acceptable for others? WP may be a volunteer project but even volunteers deserve to know when they might be wasting their time using the wrong sources.

I started a discussion at '''[[WP:VPP#How to inform editors of a variance in WP:RS standards?]]''' and would like to get WP editors who are fluent with sourcing issues to comment on this topic. The WP:RS policy page talks about sources in context and also fact-vs-opinion sources. I am sure this discussion touches on those concepts and I am not opposed to such variances in requirements but I think there are some logistical questions that need to be answered for the benefit of both editors and the encyclopedia as a whole. Please join the discussion at the VPP link above if you have anything that would help on this topic. Thank you.

===Background (Persondata)'''

From [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]: {{tq|"Persondata is a special set of metadata that can and should be added to biographical articles only. It consists of standardized data fields with basic information about the person (name, short description, birth and death days, and places of birth and death) that, unlike conventional Wikipedia content, can be extracted automatically and processed by cataloging tools and then used for a variety of purposes, such as providing advanced search capabilities, statistical analysis, automated categorization, and birthday lists."}}

The question of whether to delete {{tl|Persondata}} has been visited in the past, the motivation being that [[Wikidata]] (and infoboxes) now provides better functionality, making Persondata obsolete. The main concern from [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 113#RfC: Should Persondata template be removed from articles?|the last RfC]] was that it was too soon, and that the info from Persondata should be copied to Wikidata before any deleting should be considered. Since then, a [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2014 October 17#Template:Persondata|TfD ruled the template deprecated]], but as there were only 4 users participating (compared with the ~50 users in the RfC) no action was put in motion to stop adding new templates.

In the meantime, [[wikidata:User:PLbot|PLbot]] has now copied all of {{para|SHORT DESCRIPTION}} to Wikidata ([[wikidata:User talk:Pasleim#Import SHORT DESCRIPTION from Persondata|link]]). In various conversations, all other fields of Persondata have been argued to be too unreliable for any meaningful use. The bot request for copying the data to Wikidata is closed ([[wikidata:Wikidata:Bot_requests/Archive/2014/10#Final_conclusion|archived]]), and Wikidata isn't interested in the remaining Persondata fields.

;Faults of Persondata:
*Problems with name sorting, formatting guidelines not always followed, and there are also names like "Otto von Bismarck" or "Martin Luther King Jr" which are often mislabeled. ([[wikidata:Wikidata:Property proposal/Generic#Sort key|link]], [[wikidata:Wikidata:Bot_requests/Archive/2014/10#Import_Persondata_from_English_Wikipedia|link]])
*Problems with date formatting, also dates before a certain time are unreliable as Gregorian and Julian formats are indistinguishable ([[wikidata:Wikidata:Bot_requests/Archive/2014/10#Import_Persondata_from_English_Wikipedia|link]]). Also, dates rarely have references ([[Wikipedia talk:Persondata#Birth and death dates references.|link]])
*Problems with location disambiguation; formatting and when there is no link markup, or too much link markup ([[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Persondata/Archive 2#Place of birth through the ages|link]], [[wikidata:Wikidata:Bot_requests/Archive/2014/10#Import_Persondata_from_English_Wikipedia|link]], [[Wikipedia talk:Persondata/Archive 7#Overlinking in Persondata|link]]) 
*It is not used by anyone that I know of (Periglio is now using Wikidata)
*[[User:Periglio/Wikidata]]: Analysis of accuracy of Persondata vs Wikidata. 
*[[User:Pigsonthewing/Persondata]]: explains some additional problems with persondata

;Reasons to keep Persondata:
* If anyone is currently using it.
* If the parameters other than short description can be shown to be useful and worth keeping.
* If any future use cannot be replaced by Wikidata.

;Rough plan
I have compiled a rough plan of how Persondata will be migrated to Wikidata and eventually deleted (A more detailed version can be found [[User:Msmarmalade/Persondata#Rough Plan|here]]). This is my own plan, and doesn't necessarily have to be the way we do it. I am only mentioning it here so I don't give the impression that this RfC is to delete Persondata immediately. Please discuss below if you have any suggestions.

# Transfer {{para|SHORT DESCRIPTION}} across to Wikidata. {{Done}}
# Stop bots from automatically creating new Persondata templates.
# Notify users in relevant projects of deprecation.
# Transfer any new data to Wikidata, then remove methodically.
# Close the template and relevant pages when ready.

'''Questions:'''
#Is anyone still using Persondata?
#*Are any Wikidata bots still extracting Persondata for new/revised articles?
#Can Persondata be considered deprecated and no longer added to articles?
#Is short description the only useful parameter?
#'''Main Question:''' Should the {{Tl|Persondata}} template be methodically removed from articles and no longer be used?

In the open RFC [[#RfC: some proper talkin' about station title conventions]] above, it appears that a clear majority of respondents would prefer to not treat the appearance of "Station" on a pylon or station sign as a reliable indication that "Station" is a part of the official station name.  That is, [[Greenbelt station]] would be the advice of  [[WP:USSTATION]], since in official station lists (and platform signs) the station name is "Greenbelt", not "Greenbelt Station".   

Proposition:  Treat the USSTATION guideline on capitalization literally, only capitalizing station when a reliable source shows that it is part of the official station name; default to using offical station name lists for this purpose, except where better sources can be found.

Should the article opening use the Oxford English Dictionary definition of "hapa"?  One argument states the word has moved into mainstream English, as evidenced by the OED definition ("a person who is of partial Asian or Pacific Islander descent"), then follows article lead with the word's usage in Hawaii.  Another edit argues the OED is not a reliable source on non-English words and leads with a Hawaiian-centric definition ("a person of mixed ethnic heritage"), then follows with California-centric usage.

Hi, I'd like to get some consensus for which picture is more appropriate for this article. I placed a new picture from 2014 in the article last year, in October. It stayed until just recently, when it was reverted to a picture from 2011, with the comment "Revert. We do not change photos simply because they are more recent. This new photo is smaller, he's not facing the camera, and his facial experession is inferior. Also, Columbia University is not called "The" Columbia University."(sic). I'm a bit confused - because in fact, my new photo is smaller vertically by 500 pixels, but much wider, and uses more pixels for his face. I also prefer the composition of it (I'll refrain from criticizing the other picture since I don't believe it's appropriate), but that's a personal choice obviously - that's why I'd like to get some input as to what sort of aesthetic is preferred - since, judging by Nightscream's revert, it comes down to aesthetics. Thank you, [[User:Tduk|Tduk]] ([[User talk:Tduk|talk]]) 23:01, 15 April 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Arguments have been made that practitioners of alternative medicine (for instance, acupuncturists) have a conflict of interest with regard to content describing their field of practice.

Broadly, the argument for that claim, is that alt-med practitioners have a need to legitimize their field (adding positive content, and removing negative content) in order to get more people to use their services. 

Broadly, the argument against that claim is that within Wikipedia generally, professionals are not considered to have a conflict of interest for content about their field; indeed we welcome experts' contributions, as long as they don't edit to promote their individual practices, publications, or pet theories (see for example the part of the COI guideline on [[Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest#Writing_about_yourself_and_your_work|Writing about yourself and your work]] and the essays [[WP:EXPERT]] and [[Wikipedia:Conflicts of interest (medicine)]])

Arguments over this are causing conflicts at the [[acupuncture]] article, for example, with some editors tagging the article for COI due to editors who have disclosed that they are acupuncturists directly editing the article, and other editors removing the tag. 

So the RfC question:  '''do practitioners of alternative medicine (for examples, acupuncturists or naturopathists) have a conflict of interest with regard to content describing their field of practice?  The question is narrow, on the yes/no.  If the community says "yes", a subsequent RfC will address what limits such practitioners should abide by.'''  I am publicizing this widely.

 (automatically updated)'''

'''Background'''

The religion entry in [[WP:BLP|BLP]] infoboxes has been a contentious issue for many years, with multiple participants disputing what, if anything, should come after the "Religion = " entry in cases where the subject of the page has no religion.

This RfC is an attempt to create a bright line answer concerning exactly what the consensus is. 

'''What this RfC is and is not'''

This RfC only applies to infoboxes, not to the body of the article.

This RfC only applies to the religion field of the infobox.

This RfC only applies to biographies of living persons, not organizations or historic figures.

This RfC only applies to atheism, agnosticism, irreligion, and other ways of indicating "no religion". It specifically does not apply to [[Humanism]] or atheistic religions (examples: [[Atheism in Hinduism]], [[Unitarian Universalism#Beliefs]], [[Christian atheism]], [[Nontheist Quakers]], [[Pandeism]]). 

This RfC only applies to what is on the right side of the "religion =" field. There is already a strong consensus against changing "religion =" to something else or deleting "religion =" from the template. If you disagree, please post a new RfC instead of hijacking this one.

This RfC does not address the existing strong consensus that a person's religion is only to be mentioned in the infobox if it is self-identified, relevant (per the template guideline), supported by reliable sources, and covered in the body of the article. If you disagree, please post a new RfC instead of hijacking this one.

This RfC does not address the existing strong consensus that "Religion: Atheist" and "Religion: Agnostic" should not be used. If you disagree, you may indicate this in the "Support [other]" section.

'''Ground Rules'''

Previous discussions have generated large numbers of rather heated comments, so no replies will be allowed in the support sections. This is the best way to make it clear who supports what. Please keep all threaded discussion in the threaded discussion section.

As always with RfCs, the quality of your argument counts more than the support counts. A compelling policy-based argument is worth more than multiple "I like it" / "I hate it" comments. 

Because this has been such a contentious issue in the past, I plan on letting this run the full 30 days and then asking an uninvolved administrator (more than one If I can get them) with experience closing controversial RfCs to close this RfC. An issue that this many people feel this strongly about should not be [[WP:SNOW|snow closed]].

When you reply in the threaded discussion section, you may wish to add "@[[User:Example|Example]]" to indicate who you replied to. If you reply in the support sections your reply will be moved to the threaded discussion section with a "@[[User:Example|Example]]:" added at the start of the comment.

''' Support "Religion: None" '''

'''In infoboxes on biographies of living persons, atheism, agnosticism, and other terms for having no religion should be indicated with "religion = None", which displays as "Religion: None".'''

Former conversations on this topic can be found at: [[Talk:Paul_Singer_(businessman)#Donors_Trust]] and [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Column_on_Donors_Trust_on_.28but_not_by.29_NBC]].

The main arguments which <u>support inclusion</u> have been;
#The information is verifiable
#The information is relevant to Singer's political activities

The main arguments which <u>oppose inclusion</u> have been;
#Having "an account" is ambiguous, and it's impossible to know if it's relevant to political activities
#The information simply isn't notable and shouldn't be included

{{rfcquote|text=
So long story short, I found {{File:Kogaru1.jpg}} and thought it would be good to use as an example in the article [[Fan service]] what I had forgot about was a discussion 4 years ago about the said image: [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive685#Insertion_of_an_image_from_a_banned_user_advertising_their_work_depicting_child_sexual_abuse|community consensus]]. So I am wondering, has anything changed? A few points I want to make:

*1. The image is being used globally on 11 different Wikipedia languages.
*2. If the Wikimedia Foundation took issue with the image it would have been axed a long time ago, my example being the lolicon image of wikipe-tan that was deleted by Jimbo Wales.
*3. The image is free use, it is very hard to find free use images on the internet that depict what a subject is about.
*4. Wikipedia is not censored, this being a fictional drawing there is no way of telling how old the depicted female is (Nothing is shown to indicate).
*5. The original up-loader of the image had been banned but the image was re-uploaded and as I said has been in use globally. 

So with all of these points said, is there a way we can form a new consensus on it's use? - [[User:Knowledgekid87|Knowledgekid87]] ([[User talk:Knowledgekid87|talk]]) 23:21, 21 May 2015 (UTC)}}

''' Add new info on Beepi '''

Disclosure: [[WP: COI]] I have a COI. Please see my user profile, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BC1278,  for a fuller disclosure and my affirmation that I abide by all Wikipedia policies and put the Wikipedia mission above other considerations. 

Three major stories appeared about Beepi appeared April, 2015, one in The New York Times, Bloomberg Business Week, one in USA Today. <ref>{{Cite news|url =http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-08/beepi-sees-valuation-soaring-with-revenue-in-national-expansion|title =Beepi Expands Reach of Service That’s Like Zappos for Used Cars|last = Cao|first = Jing|date = April 8, 2015|work = Bloomberg Business Week|access-date = April 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url =http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/04/07/beepi-aims-for-uber-like-ease-buying-and-selling-used-cars/25421887/|title =Beepi brings Uber-like ease to used-car shopping|last = della Cava|first = Marco|date = April 8, 2015|work = USA Today|access-date = April 13, 2015}}</ref>

From Business Week we learned the Beepi's revenue has grown 10x since December 2014, since it raised $79 million. <ref>{{Cite news|url =http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-08/beepi-sees-valuation-soaring-with-revenue-in-national-expansion|title =Beepi Expands Reach of Service That’s Like Zappos for Used Cars|last = Cao|first = Jing|date = April 8, 2015|work = Bloomberg Business Week|access-date = April 13, 2015}}</ref>

The New York Times reported the Beepi revenue is expected to be $100 million over the next year. <ref>{{Cite news|url =http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/technology/personaltech/an-online-tune-up-for-the-used-car-marketplace.html?hpw&rref=business&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well|title =An Online Tune-Up for the Used-Car Marketplace|last =Manjoo|first = Farhad|date = April 22, 2015|work = The New York Times|access-date = April 22, 2015}}</ref>

I think these facts should be added to the article as it's highly relevant to any reader researching the economic performance of the company and the peer-to-peer online marketplace business model. 

Then on April, 15 2015, Forbes named Beepi to their list of companies expected to reach a billion dollar valuation. It says the company currently has a $200 million valuation. <ref>{{Cite news|url =
http://www.forbes.com/pictures/feki45efiei/beepi/ |title =Next Billion Dollar Start Ups: Beepi|last =|first =|date = April 15, 2015|work = Forbes|access-date = April 18, 2015}}</ref>

I'd also like to add a sentence to the this article based on this, as I think it's highly relevant to the subject matter and will be of great interest to anyone trying to learn about this company. The source, Fobres Magazine, is highly reputable as an independent media company. 

The complete suggested edit is:

Beepi's revenue has grown 10x since December 2014, since it raised $79 million <ref>{{Cite news|url =http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-08/beepi-sees-valuation-soaring-with-revenue-in-national-expansion|title =Beepi Expands Reach of Service That’s Like Zappos for Used Cars|last = Cao|first = Jing|date = April 8, 2015|work = Bloomberg Business Week|access-date = April 13, 2015}}</ref> and is on track to reach $100 million annually, the company reported. <ref>{{Cite news|url =http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/technology/personaltech/an-online-tune-up-for-the-used-car-marketplace.html?hpw&rref=business&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well|title =An Online Tune-Up for the Used-Car Marketplace|last =Manjoo|first = Farhad|date = April 22, 2015|work = The New York Times|access-date = April 22, 2015}}</ref> In April 2015, [[Forbes]] named Beepi to their list of companies expected to reach a billion dollar valuation.

Foreword: as the section's title indicates, this matter is completely irrelevant to the title of this Wikipedia article.

The concern right now involves the correct title of this video game. One position is C: The Contra Adventure, the other is simply The Contra Adventure. The latter is supported only by the assumption that the large "C" in the game's packaging case and manual is nothing more than a "logogram" and not part of the actual name.

There is weighted evidence that supports the notion that the official name of this video game is C: The Contra Adventure. Here is a sample of reputable sources, out of a pool of several:

:http://ca.ign.com/articles/1998/09/17/c-the-contra-adventure
:http://www.amazon.com/C-Contra-Adventure-Playstation/dp/B00002STIG
:http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/196860-c-the-contra-adventure
:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0782031/
:http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/c-the-contra-adventure-review/1900-2546981/

:http://strategywiki.org/wiki/C:_The_Contra_Adventure
:http://www.giantbomb.com/c-the-contra-adventure/3030-7454/
:http://klustr.net/contra/games/
:https://contrapedia.wordpress.com/c-the-contra-adventure/
:http://contra.kontek.net/games/games.htm

Further, the other games in the Contra series have a similar design to the name on their packaging:

:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_III:_The_Alien_Wars
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Hard_Corps
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Legacy_of_War
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Shattered_Soldier
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Corps:_Uprising

They are universally and unanimously accepted as having the colon and the text that precedes it in the official title.

The strongest evidence that supports the title of C: The Contra Adventure is present directly in the video game's instruction manual, on several pages:

Because the proposal to establish a dedicated [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/Archive_122#Proposal:_creation_of_.22style_noticeboard.22|style noticeboard]] has fallen through, it is now proposed that Wikipedia talk:MoS be established as Wikipedia's official page for style Q&A.  This would involve the following actions:

:1) Adding text to the effect of "and for questions about the use of capitalization, punctuation, organization and other matters of style on Wikipedia" to "This is the talk page for discussing improvements to the Manual of Style page."
:2) Inserting text to the effect of "ask style questions at Wikipedia talk:MoS" any place that would otherwise have pointed to a style noticeboard.
:3) Inserting text to the effect of "ask style questions at Wikipedia talk:MoS (and not here)" in the talk pages of other style guide pages so that style Q&A is more centralized.

Here are the kinds of questions that people ask: [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style#question_about_tense_for_historic_aircraft|1]], [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Archive_104#I_need_advice_on_how_to_start_a_sentence|2]], [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Archive_165#Possible_WP:ENGVAR_issue.3F|3]].

The goal of this proposal is make help with Wikipedia style issues easier to find and more centralized without increasing opportunities for forum shopping.  WT: MoS has already served as an unofficial Q&A board for many years.

To save giving up on this I thought I'd have a go with an RfC.

This comes after the compilation and presentation of a number of extensive multiple RMs which, while gaining limited support, have otherwise been shot down in flames.  I do not, however, consider this to be forum shopping as various of the less positive contributors have commented that the presentation of an RfC would be an appropriate route to take.  Base pages for the current multiple RfC are as follows:
*[[List of largest airlines in Africa]] → [[List of the largest airlines in Africa]]
*[[List of most common surnames in Asia]] → [[List of the most common surnames in Asia]]
*[[List of tallest bridges in the world]] → [[List of the tallest bridges in the world]]
*[[List of world's largest passenger ships]] → [[List of the world's largest passenger ships]]
At personal preference I think that it would be beneficial if a decision can be made one way or another on this topic before the closure of the RMs so as to, potentially, save the effort that went into their compilation.

On the basis that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia I conducted a search on books in the form: [https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#tbm=bks&q=(most+OR+least+OR+lightest+OR+heaviest+OR+tallest+OR+longest+OR+shortest)+AND+%22in+the%22 (most OR least OR lightest OR heaviest OR tallest OR longest OR shortest) AND "in the".]  Results that contained a "fooest" content followed by something like an "in bar" content were, in sequence, as follows:
{{Ordered list

|The Most Important Fish in the Sea

}}
I went through 18+ examples (not including, presumably, reprints or the "in Most of the World" example) that consistently used "the fooest" before finding one example, which happened to be at the beginning of the phrasing, which omitted the article.  


My next step in research involved a web based search on [https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=grammar%20guide%20superlative grammar guide superlative]

Results (with quotation of sections of relevant content) in sequence are presented as follows:

<big>SUPERLATIVE ADJECTIVES</big>

Superlative adjectives are used to describe an object which is at the upper or lower limit of a quality (''the tallest, the smallest, the fastest, the highest''). They are used in sentences where a subject is compared to a group of objects.

Noun (subject) + verb + the + superlative adjective + noun (object).

'''The group that is being compared with can be omitted if it is clear from the context (final example below).'''

EXAMPLES

*My house is the '''largest''' one in our neighborhood.
*This is the '''smallest''' box I've ever seen.
*Your dog ran the '''fastest''' of any dog in the race.
*We all threw our rocks at the same time. My rock flew the '''highest'''. ("of all the rocks" is understood)

This text is as presented on the website and represents basic grammar.

The fourth website - http://www.learnenglish.de/grammar/adjectivesuper.html - shows that even the Germans get this right.  Why can't we???


My concern is that, at present, Wikipedia presents examples of use of syntax that, if students were to emulate, would lose them marks.  

I have also seen nothing similar to the current Wikipedia title presentations in contents like Britannica.  


Many list type articles that contain superlatives are linked to [[:Category:Lists of superlatives]]

[[File:Uss nevada.jpg|thumb|300px|right|TLDR: as a general reader, what seems easier to you: {{USS|Nevada|BB-36}} or [[USS Nevada (BB-36)|USS ''Nevada'' (1914)]]?]]
This RfC proposes to replace [[Hull number|hull]] or [[pennant number|pennant]] numbers in article titles with [[Ceremonial ship launching|launch dates]]. As my views have previously been made [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Military_history/Archive_129#On_hull.2Fpennant_numbers|abundantly clear]], I'll present them here. 

:Currently, Wikipedia's [[WP:SHIPNAME|ship name]] policy specifies that [[hull number|hull]] and [[pennant number|pennant]] numbers (e.g. USS ''Carl Vinson'' (CVN-70)) be used to disambiguate ships when appropriate. This is a change from an the older policy, which used them wherever possible, but there is at least a significant minority that still favors the approach.

:Why should a general reader with no knowledge about warships know that they would need to type in something like [[USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70)|(CVN-70)]]? At best, this is useless [[WP:JARGON|jargon]] for non-specialists. Worse, an argument for consistency falls flat when only a minority of countries use them; we only have these numbers for American and British/some Commonwealth ships. Now:
:*With American [[hull classification symbol]]s, it's a lot of unneeded fluff in the title, and [[WP:PRECISE]] should force us to drop it (unless another ship shared the same name, obviously). These numbers have been changed in a non-trivial number of cases, like the {{sclass-|Knox|frigate|1}}.
:*With British [[pennant number]]s, they're reused. If you can honestly tell me what ship {{HMS|Ark Royal|91}} is without looking or guessing, I'll give you a cookie. Not a single person can argue that pennant numbers are helpful to a general reader when they type a ship name in the search bar. As my colleague {{u|Parsecboy}} said, "Which is more helpful to non-experts trying to find the WWII Ark Royal in the auto-fill drop down - a list of articles with (91), (R07), and (R09) as dabs, or a list of articles with (1937), (1950), and (1981) as dabs?"

So given that it's pretty apparent that we've been perpetuating a system that is completely useless to helping our readers, '''I'm proposing that [[WP:SHIPNAME]] be changed to mandate the use of launch dates rather than hull numbers when disambiguation is necessary.''' [[Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(ships)#Disambiguating_ships_with_the_same_name|We already do this]] for ships that predate hull numbers, and such a system would be ''far'' easier to navigate for our readers, who (a) are why we are here and (b) again, typically have little to no specialist knowledge about ships.

{{rfcquote|text=
I've looked over this article and tried to fix a few inconsistencies and other problems. I don't accept some claims above that the article is so irredeemable that it should be deleted; it just needs to be made more consistent. But a couple of serious questions need to be answered before it can be improved, and these are my suggested answers:

1) What kinds of political entity count? 
* Sovereign states: obviously. 
* Overseas territories (including anomalies like China's SARs and the UK's Crown Dependencies): maybe, but needs to be done consistently. List all or none.
* Disputed (partially recognised) states like Transnistria: serious [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:NPOV]] dangers here. If these entities are to be listed at all, their anomalous constitutional status must be emphasised. Implying (even by omission) that they are equivalent to undisputed sovereign states is an egregious NPOV violation. Moreover, facts about such small and obscure territories (beyond "the somewhat dubious constitution scribbled down in the middle of a civil war says that the official language is X") can be hard to verify independently.
* Sub-national entities (e.g. South Tyrol, states and provinces of federal countries): probably not. To apply this fairly, if you want to say that Quebec speaks French and South Tyrol speaks German you'd need to list every single Russian federal subject and say they all speak Russian, every US and Australian state and Canadian province except Quebec and say they speak English, etc.
* Micronations (e.g. Sealand): No. NPOV, OR and all the rest of it.

2) What exactly is the criterion for "being spoken" in a country?
* Official/national language of the country: yes, this doesn't seem to be in dispute.
* Clear majority language even if not official (e.g. for countries like the USA, UK and Australia which do not have ''de jure'' official languages): yes, ''de facto'' much the same as above.
* Minority languages: No; serious potential problems with [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:NPOV]] here. I removed an assertion that Russian is a language of Israel; even if there is a large minority of Russian speakers due to immigration from the USSR, the language is not officially recognised and I see no evidence that it is the majority language of Israel.
* Languages with official recognition as "regional languages" or similar: No, generally not notable enough (same argument as above relating to languages spoken in individual states and provinces of countries, regardless of whether there is official recognition of the language).
* Historical association with a country or territory: No; I removed Goa from the list of Portuguese-speaking countries and territories. Even aside from the fact that Goa isn't a country and we don't list the official languages of each Indian state separately (my point above), I see no evidence that Portuguese continues to be widely used in Goa. Even the [[Goa|article on Goa]] flatly contradicts this and says that Portuguese use is mostly associated with the older generations and is decreasing.

At [[Wikipedia talk:Article titles#Combined proposal]] I proposed an update to the [[Wikipedia:Article titles]] policy part that explains and illustrates Precision, Conciseness and Disambiguation as applied to article titles (currently at [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Precision and disambiguation]]). After some preliminary comments at [[Wikipedia talk:Article titles#Comments on #Combined proposal]], this seems ready for RfC. --[[User:Francis Schonken|Francis Schonken]] ([[User talk:Francis Schonken|talk]]) 07:36, 12 May 2015 (UTC)}}

There is a debate on the neutrality of the following sentence:
<blockquote>A devout believer in Nichiren Buddhism in the latter half of his life, he joined the Kokuchūkai, a Nichiren Buddhist organization with nationalistic leanings, though it is unclear for how long, and what influence (if any) this had on his life and work.</blockquote>
Should it remain the same, have "with nationalistic leanings" removed, have "Kenji rejected the Kokuchūkai's nationalistic views" added, or something else?

When article titles about works by the composer [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] are disambiguated using the composer's name, should that name take the form ''John Ireland'' in all cases, or should it normally take the form ''Ireland'' and only use the form ''John Ireland'' when ''Ireland'' alone would be ambiguous or misleading?

Notes:
#This RFC is not asking whether the composer's name should be used as disambiguator, but only what form it should take when the name is chosen as a disambiguator.
#The question applies whether the name is the sole disambiguator in a given title or whether other information (e.g. a date) in used as well.

Hello. There has been a bit of dispute regarding some edits I made today to this article. This is the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scott_Walker_(politician)&oldid=659318546 article just before I started editing it.] Basically, I created a new page, [[Political positions of Scott Walker]] and moved some of the Gubernatorial stuff over there. After reaching consensus that that article was more about his time as Governor than his political positions, I created the [[Governorship of Scott Walker]] article. I have moved quite a bit of content from the main SW article to those two and have added quite a bit of new content to those articles as well. I left summaries behind at the main article and am trying to keep everything straight. (I've done a lot of going back and forth between pages.) Most of the political articles I've worked on have gone through this process (Everything from Rand Paul to Jeb Bush to Hillary Clinton) and I think it's better. Another editor was concerned with the massive change.  '''Basically, is 3 articles better than 1?''' Should we return everything back to the main page (keeping some of the c/e I did) or keep it at three separate pages. <small>(I apologize for the length of the explanation... It's been a long day of editing!)</small> [[User:PrairieKid|PrairieKid]] ([[User talk:PrairieKid|talk]]) 06:05, 27 April 2015 (UTC)}}

There has been a good amount of discussion on the issue that which architectural style is used in the building. I am searching for a better answer so as to include it in the lead section and go with it to make the article more stable.

The current head says:''The Taj Mahal combines elements from [[Indian architecture|Indian]], [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Persian architecture|Persian]], [[Ottoman architecture|Turkish]] architectural styles.''

I would prefer to go with the current one as I could deduce evidently that it actually is a blend of Indian and Islamic with a slight touch of Persian and Turkish..-[[User:The Herald|The Herald]] [[User talk:The Herald|<sup style="margin-left:0.5px">''the joy of the LORD''</sup>]][[Special:Contributions/The Herald|<sub style="margin-left:-47.5px">''my strength''</sub>]] 10:11, 27 April 2015 (UTC)}}

I'm getting sick of this. <s>Hundreds</s>'''Thousands''' ({{cl|CS1_errors:_chapter_ignored}}) of articles are affected and now display errors where they once worked fine because of the recent conversion. There was no discussion, no attempt to implement this in a thoughtful way. Chapter, section, etc, are perfectly reasonable parameters to expect in newspapers, periodicals, websites, books, and many other form of citations. The workarounds are simply not reasonable: title? No, not part of the title. departments? No, that sticks it in-front of the title, not correct in any citation style. at? wtf is that?

Please fix this by making the previously usable parameters work. I'm tired of having to update dozens to hundreds of articles, many of which are good or featured, to remedy an undiscussed fuck-up. If someone "needs" this to be in RfC question format: Should these errors be fixed in the citation template or the numerous affected articles where it previously worked. - '''[[User:Floydian|<font color="#5A5AC5">Floydian</font>]]'''&nbsp;<sup>[[User_talk:Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">τ</font>]]</sup> <sub>[[Special:Contributions/Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">¢</font>]]</sub> 21:05, 28 April 2015 (UTC)}}

I am not disputing that discussion of each of these innovations belongs in the article. However, I feel that we need to reorganize how the information is presented. I currently read the section as a long list that is written in such a way that it is distant from the overall intent of a biography. User:Dream Focus disagrees and believes the section should stay as it is. In the thread above, I suggested that we either rewrite the section in a manner similar to the FA article [[James Joyce]], or move it to a separate article like [[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci]] (calling it: "Innovations and designs of Steve Jobs"). Either way, discussion of all of the innovations needs to be expanded throughout the article, in a manner similar to the GA article [[Leonardo da Vinci]] so I am not suggesting the removing of overall content. The point is that the article needs to sound more like a cohesive biography with an explicit structure. -[[User:Classicfilms|Classicfilms]] ([[User talk:Classicfilms|talk]]) 17:51, 28 May 2015 (UTC)}}

== A way to prevent revertwars from erupting '''

I propose a way to eliminate the current separation between the discussion and revision history pages, as it is a major cause of edit wars. For example, if one's contribution is undone (itself a much-abused tool), what is often the first instinct? To revert it! And leave a message in edit summary explaining why the undoer is wrong. They will in turn likely do the same... leaving an edit summary message saying why ''you'' are wrong. This only leads to reversion wars, because the only way to reply, to leave a message on that page, is to make an edit...
The talk page? Indeed, leave the edit conflict, go there and navigate the wall of text, ''edit'' the page (which is more cumbersome than a message box system), then try to attract the other's attention... and ''who'' is going to start the discussion? The one whose version is current doesn't care anymore, the other one only cares about making ''their'' version current!
If only messages could be posted inline on the revision history page, the whole process would become so much less reversome and smoother. The messages would be posted through a message box, and be posted on the page as expandible stubs, shown in chronological order between the revision versions. There would be clickable tags inside the messages that would scroll to the message being replied to, and tags to scroll to any replies.
If there are more than eg five or ten messages between two revisions, the list could be collapsed.
Messages posted privately from one of the users to another would show up as stubs that are only expandible by the sender and receiver. And a captcha in the messagebox would prevent spam and overuse.

The current system makes it pathologically ready to invalidate another user's contribution by deleting it entirely (which is distinctly inflammatory), and far too cumbersome to discuss changes instead. And this creates disproportionate damage when the edit in question is large, as it's more likely to be reverted. So even though most edits aren't reverted, reversion is a big problem.

Regarding undo: 'undo' is far too often a way of saying 'I sort of disagree, and can't be bothered to show subtlety'. Instead of 'undo', the button should be 'see changes' (with an edit box below a comparison of this version and the one preceeding it, and the ability to select and copy text from the two sides separately). This would encourage people to treat others' contributions with greater respect. <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/85.211.109.208|85.211.109.208]] ([[User talk:85.211.109.208|talk]]) 03:55, 7 May 2015 (UTC)}}

===Background (Persondata)'''

From [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]: {{tq|"Persondata is a special set of metadata that can and should be added to biographical articles only. It consists of standardized data fields with basic information about the person (name, short description, birth and death days, and places of birth and death) that, unlike conventional Wikipedia content, can be extracted automatically and processed by cataloging tools and then used for a variety of purposes, such as providing advanced search capabilities, statistical analysis, automated categorization, and birthday lists."}}

The question of whether to delete {{tl|Persondata}} has been visited in the past, the motivation being that [[Wikidata]] (and infoboxes) now provides better functionality, making Persondata obsolete. The main concern from [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 113#RfC: Should Persondata template be removed from articles?|the last RfC]] was that it was too soon, and that the info from Persondata should be copied to Wikidata before any deleting should be considered. Since then, a [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2014 October 17#Template:Persondata|TfD ruled the template deprecated]], but as there were only 4 users participating (compared with the ~50 users in the RfC) no action was put in motion to stop adding new templates.

In the meantime, [[wikidata:User:PLbot|PLbot]] has now copied all of {{para|SHORT DESCRIPTION}} to Wikidata ([[wikidata:User talk:Pasleim#Import SHORT DESCRIPTION from Persondata|link]]). In various conversations, all other fields of Persondata have been argued to be too unreliable for any meaningful use. The bot request for copying the data to Wikidata is closed ([[wikidata:Wikidata:Bot_requests/Archive/2014/10#Final_conclusion|archived]]), and Wikidata isn't interested in the remaining Persondata fields.

;Faults of Persondata:
*Problems with name sorting, formatting guidelines not always followed, and there are also names like "Otto von Bismarck" or "Martin Luther King Jr" which are often mislabeled. ([[wikidata:Wikidata:Property proposal/Generic#Sort key|link]], [[wikidata:Wikidata:Bot_requests/Archive/2014/10#Import_Persondata_from_English_Wikipedia|link]])
*Problems with date formatting, also dates before a certain time are unreliable as Gregorian and Julian formats are indistinguishable ([[wikidata:Wikidata:Bot_requests/Archive/2014/10#Import_Persondata_from_English_Wikipedia|link]]). Also, dates rarely have references ([[Wikipedia talk:Persondata#Birth and death dates references.|link]])
*Problems with location disambiguation; formatting and when there is no link markup, or too much link markup ([[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Persondata/Archive 2#Place of birth through the ages|link]], [[wikidata:Wikidata:Bot_requests/Archive/2014/10#Import_Persondata_from_English_Wikipedia|link]], [[Wikipedia talk:Persondata/Archive 7#Overlinking in Persondata|link]]) 
*It is not used by anyone that I know of (Periglio is now using Wikidata)
*[[User:Periglio/Wikidata]]: Analysis of accuracy of Persondata vs Wikidata. 
*[[User:Pigsonthewing/Persondata]]: explains some additional problems with persondata

;Reasons to keep Persondata:
* If anyone is currently using it.
* If the parameters other than short description can be shown to be useful and worth keeping.
* If any future use cannot be replaced by Wikidata.

;Rough plan
I have compiled a rough plan of how Persondata will be migrated to Wikidata and eventually deleted (A more detailed version can be found [[User:Msmarmalade/Persondata#Rough Plan|here]]). This is my own plan, and doesn't necessarily have to be the way we do it. I am only mentioning it here so I don't give the impression that this RfC is to delete Persondata immediately. Please discuss below if you have any suggestions.

# Transfer {{para|SHORT DESCRIPTION}} across to Wikidata. {{Done}}
# Stop bots from automatically creating new Persondata templates.
# Notify users in relevant projects of deprecation.
# Transfer any new data to Wikidata, then remove methodically.
# Close the template and relevant pages when ready.

'''Questions:'''
#Is anyone still using Persondata?
#*Are any Wikidata bots still extracting Persondata for new/revised articles?
#Can Persondata be considered deprecated and no longer added to articles?
#Is short description the only useful parameter?
#'''Main Question:''' Should the {{Tl|Persondata}} template be methodically removed from articles and no longer be used?

The User [[User:Onel5969]] keeps insisting that I revert my last change (see his talk page) but I don't understand why. The version he wants would be: "ILFC is the launch customer for the Embraer E190-E2, and Embraer E195-E2, with the airline signing a Letter of Intent (LOI) for 100 total." But this sentence would only be correct if ILFC was an airline, which they are clarly not. See: [[ILFC]]

So I reverted his change and since he was using [[STiki]], I gave him a warning that he shouldn't do that because STiki policies only allow to use it against vandalism and edits that are clearly unconstructive. I really don't understand how changing airline to lessor in a sentence referring to ILFC can be clearly unconstructive.

Per the above discussion, clarify and normalize the following:
* "Unless restricted by another policy, primary sources that have been reliably published may be used in Wikipedia"
to read:
* "Unless restricted by another policy, primary sources from reputable publishers may be used in Wikipedia"
so that the wording agrees with [[WP:Reliable sources]].

Reputability of a publisher (how well-regarded it is) is directly addressed at [[WP:Reliable sources]], but the terms "reliable"/"reliability" are never used there to refer to a publisher, and as detailed above, cannot logically apply. In short form: Sources may be ''reliable'' (a determination Wikipedia makes internally, with a whole guideline full of criteria); a publisher may be ''reputable'', a quality that WP:RS indicates we observe about the off-WP world's regard for the publisher. <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 01:57, 3 June 2015 (UTC)}}

According to [[WP:JTITLE]], Japanese born prior to 1868 should be given family name first while those born later should be given family name last. In general, academic usage is to put family name first, while journalists tend to put family name last. As near as I can tell, the idea of using a specific year as a cutoff is unique to Wikipedia. I have created the following options to allow editors to express preference. For example, "BACD" indicates that "B" is the editor's first preference, "A" second, and so forth.

There has been some discussion over how to describe the current status of EMDR in the lead paragraph.  Currently, the lead contains a paragraph describing endorsements by several organizations, and then mentioning that the issue has been controversial in the past.  This paragraph misrepresents the situation by (a) presenting an appearance of overwhelming support and endorsement for the therapy, when in fact the support is more measured and moderate, and (b) minimizing the past controversy over the treatment's efficacy and the ongoing debate over its mechanisms.  This RfC is for the purpose of crafting a more accurate paragraph, free from advocacy and bias.

{{rfcquote|text=
It seems the most commonly utilized timeline templates within band articles require a specific end date set for the timeline. This is perfect for bands that have completed their career, say the band split up in 2002. However, for active bands, this needs to be updated on various occasions to maintain the appearance of the timeline. 

What I'm proposing here is that instead of inserting a random future date into the timeline, we utilize wikipedia functionality to place the current date for active bands. I'd like to have a consensus of whether we should have a rolling end date for active artists/band timeline templates, or keep the current method of iteratively extending timelines for active bands by setting the end date to a date in the future not too far off. Instead of putting future dates, we can put the current date, since technically, the band is active until the current date, (we don't know if they will be active in the future for sure). 

'''Discussion'''

How is this done? We can utilize the following code to place a rolling-end date in timelines, as such:

{{code|<nowiki>{{#time: d/m/Y }}</nowiki>}}

which results in

{{code|{{#time: d/m/Y }}}}

alternatively, the following

{{code|<nowiki>{{#time: m/d/Y }}</nowiki>}}

can be used as well depending on the date format in the timeline.

In the case of a timeline, for example, the timeline of the band [[Lost Horizon (band)|Lost Horizon]] we have:

as you can see the current date is the end date of the timeline. Notice however that {{code|<nowiki>{{#tag:timeline|Insert timeline body here}}</nowiki>}} rather than {{code|<nowiki><timeline>Insert timeline body here</timeline></nowiki>}} must be used to declare the timeline, however, for this to work properly. 

This is a minor modification, however it removes a consistent maintenance step for articles that isn't really needed, and isn't necessarily simple to rectify through the template itself without making a template specifically for active bands. (It is a timeline template after all, not a band timeline template.) I think it should be employed on articles with active bands. However, I'd like to hear what people think about it. One qualm I have is that people may not like the idea that a future release cannot be marked on the timeline beforehand. I think this isn't too much of an issue, since the timeline shouldn't necessarily run into the future, and the article itself can cover information on a future release. 

I'm not proposing we have a huge task force go through every article, this is rather an approach to having a reason to prevent people from changing timelines not to have a rolling end date if we decide this is something that should happen on active band/artist articles. Rolling end dates can be added gradually, and there wouldn't be a particularly good reason for removing these end dates as it would add extra article maintenance.

* '''Comment:''' I support the original title, the one I have made - 2015 Kumanovo clashes. The reason is simple. Kumanovo shooting would mean there was a minor incident, where a lone wolf got into some building and started shooting, for example like in the [[2015 Zvornik police station shooting]]. Therefore, the name would be misleading. The second name, Battle of Kumanovo, is also misleading, but in an opposite direction. It would mean there was a major confrontation, which it wasn't. There were clashes, and only this term is appropriate for this event. --[[User:AnulBanul|AnulBanul]] ([[User talk:AnulBanul|talk]]) 23:40, 9 May 2015 (UTC)}}

The article makes the following claim:
''In the 33-page charge sheet, the Delhi Police described the juvenile as the most brutal of the six accused.'' 
The following articles are used as citation: 
* [http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/01/04/juvenile-suspect-in-india-gang-rape-reportedly-ripped-her-intestines-out-in/, 4 January 2013, Fox News]: "The paper reported that a charge sheet on the case suggests the juvenile suspect assaulted the female student twice and pulled out her intestines with his bare hands. The juvenile—who Delhi police have not identified ''while they determine his exact age''—also wanted to strip the victim naked and throw her off the moving bus."
* [http://www.hindustantimes.com/chunk-ht-ui-indiasectionpage-delhigangrape/most-brutal-of-delhi-rape-accused-waits-to-know-his-fate/article1-984606.aspx, 4 January 2013, Hindustan Times]: "Two days after he was nabbed on December 28, the police had applied to the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) for a ''bone ossification test'' of the juvenile -- who, according to police, had subjected the victim to the most inhuman physical and sexual torture. The Delhi Police, at the moment, is ''treating him as a juvenile purely on the basis of a school leaving certificate'' obtained from a school in Badaun, UP." 
* [http://www.hindustantimes.com/newdelhi/delhi-gangrape-sixth-accused-sent-to-police-custody-for-a-day/article1-981568.aspx 27 December 2012, Hindustan Times]: This article makes no mention of any brutality by the juvenile. 
* [http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chargesheet-filed-in-delhi-gangrape-case/article4269315.ece 3 January 2013, The Hindu]:  This article makes no mention of any brutality by the juvenile. 

Now, I found a later article that has not been used: 
* [http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/not-juvenile-brutal-delhi-gangrape-assailant-now-faces-death-not-freedom/1062581/ 21 January 2013, The Indian Express]: "...it was revealed today that a ''bone ossification test'' of Vinay Sharma, one of the six accused, has proved that he was not a juvenile, and therefore, could be tried under the existing laws governing rape cases in the country. Law enforcement and forensic authorities said that as per the tests, Sharma is 19 and not below 18 as he had earlier claimed."

So, it seems that the accusations of brutality were directed at Vinay Sharma who was tried as an adult and not the unnamed juvenile. The incident has also been described in [http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/rape_verdict.pdf the judgement] but the juvenile has not been accused of any extra brutality. I think the original editors have had a mistake confusing Vinay Sharma with the unnamed juvenile. I think we should remove the sentence about brutality, until we can examine the actual police chargesheet or the verdict of juvenile court, because media reports are confusing.

The length and content of the lead to [[Edward Snowden]] have been historically contentious. On 4 June 2015, [[User:DrFleischman|Dr. Fleischman]] inserted a Lead Too Long template, stating in his edit summary: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_Snowden&type=revision&diff=665542244&oldid=665541830 "lead too long - too much detail."] That triggered a round of revisions and reversions, [[Talk:Edward_Snowden#Size_of_lead|as discussed here,]] [[Talk:Edward_Snowden#Request_for_clarification_as_to_lead_length_and_NPOV|that in turn]] forged consensus (a) that the lead ought to be shortened and (b) agreeing upon a process of submitting each proposed edit to [[Talk:Edward_Snowden#Proposed_text_to_trim_the_lead|the talk page]] for acceptance or rejection.<p>
[[User:Petrarchan47|Petrarchan47]], who has contributed more to this bio than anyone else [https://tools.wmflabs.org/usersearch/usersearch.py?name=Petrarchan47&page=Edward+Snowden&server=enwiki&max=500 (1,330 edits—17.31% of the total)] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AEdward_Snowden&type=revision&diff=665990586&oldid=665990216 then commented:] "DrFleischman, seeing that we have agreed on a process to trim the Lede (via proposal submissions), I wonder if you would be willing to remove the tag; its purpose to alert fellow editors has been served, and Kent makes good points."<p>
My points to which she referred [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AEdward_Snowden&type=revision&diff=665990216&oldid=665986012 include:] "…it is embarrassing. The first thing visitors see is a page-width banner proclaiming our inability to get the first four paragraphs right. What are readers to infer about the rest of the article? Edward Snowden is a mature BLP, created two years ago, that ranks [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/Edward_Snowden within the top 600 articles] in traffic on en.wikipedia.org. It has undergone [https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools-articleinfo/index.php?article=Edward_Snowden&lang=en&wiki=Wikipedia 7,685 revisions by a combined 1,295 editors.] … In particular, the lead has remained essentially unchanged for months. For us now to be suddenly debating its length—and its content hard won by consensus—is an admission of negligence if not incompetence. It deserves to be expeditiously addressed."<p>
However, Dr. Fleischman [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AEdward_Snowden&type=revision&diff=665997266&oldid=665997068 responded:] "I'd actually prefer to keep the tag until the issue is resolved. If editors come along having been alerted by the tag, that would be a good thing."<p>
I respectfully invite others to weigh in on this disagreement, which is not a dispute but would benefit from input by the wider editorial community than just the handful of us involved in maintaining Snowden's BLP.

{{rfcquote|text=
The previous [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 119#RfC: Guidance on commas before Jr. and Sr.|RfC: Guidance on commas before Jr. and Sr.]] has been closed with the decision to allow the comma before ''Jr.'' or ''Sr.'' to be optional provided that each article is interally consistent.  Accordingly, {{multi-section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biographies|Names|First mention|Child named for parent or predecessor}} has been amended to read: <blockquote>Editors may use or omit a comma before ''Jr.'' or ''Sr.'' so long as each article is internally consistent. Do not place a comma before a Roman numeral designation. Examples: {{xt|Sammy Davis Jr.}}; {{xt|Martin Luther King, Sr.}}; {{xt|Otis D. Wright II}}, not {{!xt|Otis D. Wright, II}}.</blockquote>

Hopefully this will avoid ongoing arguments on which is the "right" form for individual subjects (based on their preferences or sources' preferences) and won't lead to editwarring (see [[MOS:DATERET]] for the guideline avoiding similar editwarring over date formats).

As flagged in the previous discussion, this raises the issue of commas appearing '''after''' ''Jr.'' and ''Sr.''.  All style guides state that, if a comma is used before, a matching comma must appear afterwards if the sentence continues—acting as an [[Apposition|appositive]], much like commas after dates in MDY format ([[MOS:DATEFORMAT]]) and after city–state combinations ([[MOS:COMMA]]).

Unfortunately, many editors are not aware of this rule in English and sometimes argue against it.  Therefore, I recommend this section be further amended as follows:

<blockquote><p>Editors may use or omit a comma before ''Jr.'' or ''Sr.'' so long as each article is internally consistent ({{xt|Sammy Davis Jr.}} or {{xt|Martin Luther King, Sr.}}). If using a comma before, also include a comma after ''Jr.'' or ''Sr.'' if the sentence continues ({{xt|John D.

The current MoS-JA specifies we should use the FAMILY–GIVEN name order for those born before 1868, and GIVEN–FAMILY for those born 1868 or later, unless trumped by [[WP:COMMONNAME]].  This leads to situations on the edge where, within a single article, certain figures will be FAMILY–GIVEN and others GIVEN–FAMILY—as in [[Kanae Yamamoto (artist)]], where Hakuei Ishii is described as the son of Ishii Teiko.  Such an example consciously follows the guidelines, but ''appears'' to be a sloppy mistake.

Should MoS-JA be amended to allow uniform name orders in cases like this?  And how far should this be taken—should an article on Japanese history have both "Tokugawa Ieyasu" and "Shinzō Abe"?

== Moving explanation of "commonname" to UCRN hatnote '''

Currently the UCRN content is, as far as I see, split by an explanation of "commonname" which also acts to prioritise commonality over recognisability.  As far as I can see this just focusses on the means and not the desired ends.

I would prefer to use an, I think, discrete presentation as:

:''<small>See also: [[Wikipedia:Official names]] and a within policy definition of "commonname"{{blue|<sup>[''link'']</sup>}}</small>''

We currently use:

*"...the most recognizable and the most natural.  This is often referred to using the Wikipedia short cut term: "COMMONNAME".{{blue|<sup>[''link'']</sup>}}
:Wikipedia does not necessarily use the subject's "official" name ..."

The link is anchored to the following footnote:

*"Where the terms "COMMONNAME" and "common name" appear in this policy they mean a ''commonly or frequently used name'', and not necessarily a [[common name]] as used in some disciplines in opposition to [[scientific name]]."

I would sooner have a straight forward explanation of content and would like to move superfluous references to definitions etc. to the periphery.

Since allowing [[WP:GADGET|gadgets]] and [[WP:USERSCRIPT|userscripts]] to use [[WP:tags|tags]] is a new thing, what should be the protocol for creating new tags? Do we need to hold an [[WP:RfC|RfC]] for every tag? Is there anything controversial about creating a tag for a script to use (such as [[WP:Twinkle|Twinkle]] or [[User:Technical 13/1CA|OneClickArchiver]] or [[WP:WIKILOVE|wikiLove]]) to be able to find edits made with those tools more quickly and to save space in the [[WP:ES|edit summary]] for things important for the edit summary?

I propose that the protocol for creating new tags be a simple process. These tags improve the quality of the encyclopedia by making it easier to identify semi-automated edits and taking script identifiers "tags" out of the edit summary and making them actual tags. I proposed that established scripts that get used and make edits (such as the ones listed above and many others) shouldn't need any special RfC to build consensus to create the tag if a script maintainer has requested the tag (such as in this case below for {{1CA}}). — <code class="nowrap">&#123;&#123;U&#124;[[User:Technical 13|Technical 13]]&#125;&#125; <sup>([[Special:EmailUser/Technical 13|e]] • [[User talk:Technical 13|t]] • [[Special:Contribs/Technical 13|c]])</sup></code> 12:06, 12 May 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
This article currently combines three or more named categories of treatments under the umbrella term "conversion therapy".  The first is "Conversion therapy", which is the subject of an ongoing political debate in the US.  The second is "Aversion therapy", which is the distasteful practice of using electrical shocks, awful smells, or other forms of pain to condition a person's mind away from undesired attractions.  The third is "Reparative therapy" which was described by certain authors as a counseling-based treatment for people who wish to change their sexual orientation.

The way the article currently defines "Conversion therapy", surgical treatments such as lobotomy and antipsychotic prescriptions are also included.

In discussions with Wikipedia contributors (see above), it has become clear that both aversive treatments and reparative treatments are desired to remain under the definition of conversion therapy.  But from my reading of the sources, only two out of three categories belong.  This is expressed most clearly in the article below:

A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE RESEARCH BASE ON SEXUAL REORIENTATION THERAPIES; Journal of Marital and Family Therapy April 2008, Vol. 34, No. 2, 227–238; Julianne M. Serovich, Shonda M. Craft, Paula Toviessi, Rashmi Gangamma, Tiffany McDowell, and Erika L. Grafsky; The Ohio State University, University of Minnesota. URL: http://www.aamft.org/imis15/Documents/Board/j.1752-0606.2008.00065.x.pdf

"Reparative therapy, as a program of psychotherapy, attempts to ‘‘cure’’
homosexuals by transforming them into heterosexuals (Hicks, 1999). These therapies can
include a myriad of techniques including prayer, religious conversion, and individual or group
counseling. In contrast, aversion therapies are techniques which share the same goal but are
behavioral in nature, such as shock therapy. Traditional methods of aversion techniques have
been termed ‘‘cruel’’ (Haldeman, 2002) and would not pass current Institutional Review Board
Standards for acceptable research practices."

Would Wikipedia contributors and editors please comment on what I perceive to be an inconsistency at best regarding the three named categories?  [[User:SocraticOath|SocraticOath]] ([[User talk:SocraticOath|talk]]) 13:39, 12 May 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The goal of wikipedia is to be able allow anyone to edit.  It also follows the policy that blocks are to be preventative but not punitive.  We also have topic bans.  I propose we add a component to Wikipedia that allows administrators to block users from editing specific pages with the ability control expiry.  

'''Purpose:'''
*To allow administrators to control which pages a user cannot edit through specific page matching or through [[regex]] matching as well as control a restriction rule's expiry.

'''Description of proposed addon:'''
*The functioning is similar to the combination of the block function combined with parts of the title blacklist function, spam blacklist function, and the abuse filter.  The blocking administrator is able to create a rule, where within the rule, s/he can place a regex expression into a deny list as well as pages in a page matching list.  Any false positives through the regex deny list can be overridden through a page matching allow list.
*The blocking administrator is able set an expiry for this rule.
*There is no limit to the amount of rules that can be added, each with their own expiry.
*Expiry can be indefinite.
*Rules can be modified by other admins.

'''Usefulness:'''
*Users with topic bans can be stopped from editing those topic pages through a <s>reggae</s>regex expression or several page matching expressions.
*Users caught in an edit war can be stopped from editing the page they are warring on while still allowing them to productively edit other pages.

'''Why:'''
*While blocks are to prevent a user from being disruptive somewhere, it also may prevent them from being constructive elsewhere on the project.
*Reduces arbitration enforcement blocks for those with IBANs or topic bans, thereby allowing the editor to continue to contribute constructively.
*Blocks are not meant to punish, so let's not punish with them.  Blocks can still be used for vandalism, or persistent disruption, but that can be worked out in a policy RfA should this pass.

'''Policy:'''
*Should this feature come to pass, this feature is not to be used until the necessary follow up <s>RfAs</s>RfCs focusing on the policy on the usage of this feature have to come to pass.

'''Userrights introduced:'''
3 user rights are introduced and grouped into the sysop user group. (or into different usergroups sometime in the future)
*'''restrict-editing''': Allows a user to create an edit restriction rule.
*'''unrestrict-editing''': Allows a user to remove an edit restriction rule.
*'''modify-restriction''': Allows a user to modify an existing rule.

'''Access to this function:'''
*Links to this function neighbor the block links, if visible.

These abilities have been split into 3 rights should there be a reason to add certain abilities into different user groups.

The fact is: Croatia was conquered by Hungarians in 1102 and remained as a Hungarian province until 1918 (Turkish rule over Hungary included).

'''Proposal of the new article title:''' Croatia under Hungarian and Turkish rule, or Croatia 1096-1526

'''Proposal of complete rework: ''' As we see from the works of John V. A. Fine and of Alex J. Bellamy, the whole medieval history of of the region of today's Croatia is poorly sourced, based on (seventeenth- and eighteenth-century) narrative histories. Hungarian and Serbian historians are firm in their stance: Croatia was subdued by Hungarians by the arms. The much advertised 'Pacta Conventa' turned to be a fourteen-century fake. The article as written follows the nationalistic bias and the narrative histories. All together, heavily biased current text of this article shall be shortened and replaced by the new one that show, at least, the two opposing views evenhandedly.

From the article:

:''Croatia had its own local governor, or Ban; a privileged landowning nobility; and an assembly of nobles, the Sabor.[32]'' 

From serious academic sources:

:'''The Millennium of Hungary and Its People edited by József Jekelfalussy Pesti könyvnyomda-részvénytársaság, 1897'''

:Page 230: ''However it is only the affairs of Religious service and Public instruction which in their fullest extent belong to the province of territorial autonomy whereas in the province of home affairs with regard to questions of association, of passports, of police supervision over foreigners, of the rights of citizenship, and of naturalization, the executive only belongs to the autonomy; while the legislation on these subjects is a common one. For this reason there is also no separate Croatian citizenship.''

:Pages 234-235: ''The organization of the Croatia-Slavonian-Dalmatian National Assembly is on the basis of the one chamber system and the principle of indirect votes for the great part:''

...

:''Deputies are chosen according to districts, i.e. every district chooses a deputy. The conditions for the possession of a vote are (a) Hungarian citizenship; (b) the fact of belonging to a Croatian-Slavonian community ...''

:'''Catholic World, Volume 109, Paulist Fathers, 1919'''

:Pages 349-350: ''Hungarian writers assert that Croatia was reduced by force of arms. She lost entirely autonomous life and was incorporated as a conquered province in the Hungarian kingdom. "An independent Croatia is an historical absurdity," writes C. M. Knatchbull-Hugessen. "Croatian citizeship is a myth. The king of Hungary is at the same time the king of Croatia". "From a political point of view,' writes Jellinck, "Croatia and Slavonia are nothing than fully equipped provinces of Hungary"''

:'''The Political Evolution of the Hungarian Nation, Volume 2 by Cecil Marcus Knatchbull-Hugessen Brabourne (4th Baron) National Review Office, 1908'''

:Pages 312-313: ''The Habsburg who is crowned King of Hungary, ipso facto becomes King of Croatia - an indivisible part of the realms of the Sacred Crown, so expressed by the laws of 1723 and 1868. The Ban does not come in direct contact with the King, as he would necessarily do if he were the chief official of an independent State, but communicates with the Crown through the Croatian member of the Hungarian Ministry, who is responsible to the Hungarian Parliament, whose countersignature is necessary to give validity to the countersignature of the Ban of official nominations and other royal acts. Further the Ban himself is nominated by the Magyar Prime Minister, who countersigns the royal appointment made in pursuance of such nomination. There are no Croatian or Hungaro-Croatian Ministers or Parliament within the realms of St. Stephen. Parliament is Hungarian, and the Ministers are Hungarians servants of an indivisible State of which Croatia-Slavonia forms an integral part. There is no Croatian citizenship or nationality. As a member of the Sacred Crown Croatia was affected by the results of the Compromise of 1867, and as such member would have no power of independent action should the law of that year be abrogated or modified, save in so far as it is entitled and enabled to make its voice heard through its delegates to the Hungarian Parliament should a revision of Compromise affect its local or common interest, or necessitate an alteration of financial relations with Hungary on whom Croatia's insolvent autonomy lays a considerable burden.''

:'''The Early Medieval Balkans: a critical survey from the sixth to the late twelfth century by John Van Antwerp Fine - Published 1991 by University of Michigan Press'''

:Page 248 ''Sources on Medieval Croatia Early medieval Croatian history fits the concluding line to the old jingle: the more you study the less you know. When I was and undergraduate studying Balkan history I thought I knew quite a bit about Croatia; but as I study more about Croatia, one by one "facts" that I knew before turn out to be dubious, based on questionable sources or no sources at all. Most of the existing literature in western languages on medieval Croatia is extremely poor; and frequently it is marred by nationalistic bias. Much of the information about medieval Croatian history comes from later (seventeenth- and eighteenth-century) narrative histories. These were written by enthusiastic people but contain a mixture of fact and legend; and since many of the documents they based their works on are now lost, it is extremely difficult to judge whether their information came from reliable source or not.''

:'''The Realm of St Stephen: A History of Medieval Hungary, 895-1526 by Pál Engel - 2005 I.B.Tauris edition, Translated by Tamas Palosfalvi'''

:Pages 33-34 ''One of Ladislaus's most significant achievements was the occupation of Hungary's southern neighbour, Croatia. ... The small kngdom, born in the tenth century, stretched from the Kapela mountains to the Adriatic sea, its center being Biograd, located on the coast. ... King Demetrius Zvonimir, who, not being a member of the ruling dynasty, obtained his throne through election, asked Pope Gregory VII fo a crown in 1075, and, in return, declared his kingdom as a papal fief. After his death, Ladislaus laid claim on his realm by the right of his sister, Zvonimir's widow, and had no difficulty in taking possession of Croatia in 1091. He bestowed the new kingdom, together with royal title, on his nephew, Almos, son of Geza I ''

:Page 37: ''The official language of the state was recognized as Serbo-Croat. Hungary, moreover, promised to help Croatia to obtain both Dalmatia and Military Frontier Province, still under Austrian control. The latter territory, after many delays, was incorporated in Croatia in 1881, but Dalmatia remained Austrian until 1918.''

:''Despite this 'Home Rule', the Croats never felt they had achieved adequate self-government. Their Ban was appointed by the Crown (but on the nomination of Hungarian prime minister) and he was responsible to a Hungarian Minister of Sate in the Hungarian cabinet. The Croat Sabor was represented in the Hungarian Parliament by forty members in the Lower House (out of a total of about 453), and by only three members in the Upper House (out of a total of about 400)''

:The Croatian Historical Statehood Narative

:Page 37. ''It is argued that in 1102 the Croatian nobles signed an agreement - the Pacta Conventa - with Coloman, King of Hungary. The agreement confirmed the legitimacy of Koloman's succession to the Croatian throne in return for which Koloman agreed to respect the laws and customs of Croatia. The exact nature of the agreement, and even its existence, is impossible to determine as historians believe that a transcript of the Pacta Conventa preserved in the city of Trogir is actually a fourteen-century fake. There are two competing accounts of the nature of the union, one emerging predominantly from Croat historians and the other from Magyar and Serbian historians. The Croats argue that the union was a personal one in the form of a shared king, while the Magyars and Serbs insist that Croatia was conquered.''

:''The next 'signpost' of the Croatian historical statehood narrative is 1526 and the defeat of Hungary by the Ottoman Turks, which prompted Croatia's entry into the Habsburg empire. Again, the Croatian historical narrative insists that the decision to join the Habsburg empire was the result of a free choice made by Sabor.''

'''POV'''

:'''Point 1'''. The existing thext does not discriminate opinions and history narratives and documented history in the sense done by Van Antwerp Fine and Bellamy.
:'''Point 2''': 'Some of the terms of Coloman's coronation and the later status of the Croatian nobles are detailed in the Pacta Conventa, a document preserved only in transcript from the 14th century.' - this sentence cannot be in the introductory for knowing that 'Pacta Conventa' was a fourteen-century fake
:'''Point 3''': Section Name is supported exclusively by Croatian history narratives (Margetic , Sisic, Dzoic) seen only as narratives by Bellamy and Fine
:'''Point 4'''  'Croatian historians hold that the union was a personal one in the form of a shared king, a view also accepted by a number of Hungarian historians,[11][15][21][22][23][24] while Serbian and Hungarian nationalist historians preferred to see it as a form of annexation.[19][25][26]' Who marked or disqualified those  'Serbian and Hungarian nationalist historians'? This is a Wikipedia user point of view. See Bellamy who is exclusive in claiming two sides: Croatian and Hungarian and Serbian where the first ones (Croatian) are marked as nationalistic and non-scholar by Fine.Kristo Gyula was falsely linked to supporters of non-existent union. His article actually refutes that idea (reference [21]) Marta Font is a Croatian author (reference[22]).
:'''Point 5''': Croatia as actually a duchy not as a kingdom: Fine, The Late Medieval Balkans, page 22: ''From the late 1190s Croatia and Slavonia were under the Duke of Croatia. The office was usually filled by a son or brother oh the Hungarian king The dukes coined their own money and, as the king deputies, ran their duchy (which was also still known as the Kingdom of Croatia) like kings, presiding over a court and entourage modelled on the Hungarian royal court. Under the duke stood a ban or governor.''
:'''Point 6''' ''Today, Hungarian legal historians hold that the relationship of Hungary with the area of Croatia and Dalmatia in the period till 1526 and the death of Louis II was most similar to a personal union,[24][28] resembling the relationship of Scotland to England.[29][30]'' makes no sense for being refuted by many other Hungarian historians. The 'resembling the relationship of Scotland to England' is completely false for today's Scotland is not a feudal duchy to England, does not have viceroy subordinated to an English royal family member. We see that disobedient Croatian nobles were military crushed by Hungarians and their lands taken over by Hungarian nobles.
:'''Point 6''': Language Slavic vs. forged 'Croatian': from When Ethnicity Did Not Matter in the Balkans: A Study of Identity in Pre-Nationalist Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia in the Medieval and Early-Modern Periods by John V. A. Fine Jr. University of Michigan Press, Mar 2, 200 page 150
:''Thus clearly by the early sixteenth century no feeling of commonality had developed among the Slavonian nobles for Croatia''

:''What language did people speak in Dalmatia and 'Velebitia' 1102-1500?''

:''We have already seen that there the language was called "Slavic" without exception throughout the Middle Ages. Pope Alexander III visited Zadar in 1177 an the crowd that awaited him sang/chanted for hi in their Slavic language''

:''For some reas0o Klaic's translation renders it "Croatian language' but she supplies the phrase (which I quote) in the Latin original which says "Slavic language"''

:''A Venetian document from 1346 also refers to the people of Zadar speaking Slavic (lingua sclavonica)''

Should the lead include this statement?
<blockquote>
The incidents occurred during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|Israeli-Gaza armed conflict]] and, in some but not all cases, in close proximity to where intense fighting was taking place.
</blockquote>

For Example:
<blockquote>
The 2014 Israeli shelling of UNRWA Gaza shelters were seven [[Shell (projectile)|shellings]] at [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UNRWA]] facilities in the [[Gaza Strip]] which took place between 21 July and 3 August 2014. '''The incidents occurred during [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|the Israeli-Gaza armed conflict]] and, in some but not all cases, in close proximity to where intense fighting was taking place.''' The incidents were the result of [[artillery]], [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] or aerial missile fire which struck on or near the UNRWA facilities being used to shelter civilians, and as a result at least 44 civilians, including 10 UN staff died.
</blockquote>

Notes:
* All seven incidents occurred during a time of an armed conflict. The directly hit facilities are located within the the three-kilometer "buffer zone" --in which IDF and Palestinian militants clashed on the ground-- which suffered the brunt of the damage.
* Numerous sources, including the UN report state that fighting occurred "near" most of the facilities during the time frame covered in the article. For example: In the case of Beit Hanoun shelter, where the area surrounding the school was "''particularly dangerous and, as hostilities intensified, the entire area was exposed to fierce combat''"; In the case of Jabalia shelter "''In the days prior to the incident, armed clashes between militants and the IDF were talking place in the east''". In Zaitoun "''In the evening, the shelling gained in intensity in the immediate vicinity of the school, where militant activity was also noted.''" ..
*  How near/far the fighting took place is contested. The UN report note that "''none of the witnesses who had testified to UNRWA had been aware of any activity by militant groups in the school or in its "vicinity"''". For example: locals "''stated that there was no militant activity in the school or in its close vicinity, though one stated that she had heard rockets not far from the school''"
* In the UN report the incidents described as occurring, "''in a situation of armed conflict and, in some but not all cases, in close proximity to where intense fighting was taking place.''" [http://blog.unwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/Board-of-Inquiry.pdf]

The result is unambiguously in favour of '''omitting the parameter altogether''' for "none", "atheist", "secular" and variants thereof - i.e. those who either do not identify as religious, or who explicitly identify as non-religious. In response to the additional point raised below, there's no obvious reason why this would not apply to historical or fictional characters, institutions etc. If people really think they should be considered separately then feel free to start an additional RfC but this one provides ample grounds for deprecating the religion parameter in regard to secular / atheist philosophy in in any article, because the arguments would be identical in each case.

To distill the policy basis of the debate, the fundamental problem is one of [[WP:NPOV]]: "religion=none" essentially assumes that everyone must have ''some'' religion, and that religion is an essential characteristic of every person, but we live in increasingly secular times, and for many people religion simply isn't an attribute they would apply to themselves. It's a form of [[begging the question]]. Religion=none would almost certainly be wrong, in any article on Wikipedia.

That covers the case for those who do not self-identify with any specific religion. 

Another issue is noted: those who prominently self-identify as having a philosophical position on religion, but one which implicitly or explicitly rejects faith. In these cases in my view it ''may'' be legitimate to mention secularism or atheism as a ''philosophy'', and that would have qualified support according to the debate, but it is clear that they are not religions and it is both confusing and technically incorrect to label them as such. It would be unwise to use such a categorisation without prior discussion on Talk pages on a case by case basis and it would apply ''only'' to those who are ''prominently'' so identified: to pick up on a point Andy Mabbett makes, moving the whole argument to some other parameter is very clearly not supported by this consensus and would undoubtedly be seen as disruptive and [[WP:POINT]]y. Well known public advocates of a philosophical position on religion, such as Richard Dawkins, would be covered; people who once mentioned being unreligious in an interview, not so much. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 17:49, 9 June 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
There are too many cases where the draft namespace is misused for hosting blatantly unencyclopedic content and [[WP:NOTWEBHOST]] violations. This is especially a problen since even IP address users can create draft pages. [[WP:G13|CSD G13]] can only be used for deleting pages that are more than six months old. Even then, G13 deletions are technically eligible for undeletion upon request. And unencyclopedic content doesn't need to be restored. We need to clean up the draft namespace and optimise it for constructive purposes.

'''Current practises''': Whenever a reasonable user comes across a draft page with purely unencyclopedic or [[WP:NOTWEBHOST]] content, they would nominate it for G13 deletion (assuming it is 6 months old, which is often the case as draftspace stuff without the AFC templates are too slow to be discovered) rather than take it to MFD. Even when a page isn't 6 months old, a reasonable user would shop for another criterion such as G2 (test page) or G3 (vandalism). If nothing works, then the page is CSD'd with a custom rationale. 

All these practises are rough and the need of the hour is to introduce a new criterion to deal with such drafts, a sample of which are listed below in the collapsed box. To be called CSD D1 or G14 or whatever, I belive it meets all the requirements of CSD criteria as it's clearly objective, is unambiguous, is frequent, and mostly nonredundant.  

{{Collapse top|List of pages that meet the proposed criterion}}
*[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/vitaL]]

{{Collapse bottom}}

Of course, this criterion would be used for clear and unambiguous cases only (as with G11 and G12 - for unambiguous advertising and copyvios). Everything else will have to be taken to MFD. This criterion covers pages in the draft namespace as well as subpages od Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation.

In the remaining 30% of the land, intended construction is conditional on complementarity with a plan endorsed by the Israeli Civil Administration, of which less than 1% satisfies this requirement.

Demolition crews, accompanied by security officials, may arrive at any time, giving families little notice or opportunity to remove their possessions. Under Israeli military law applied to Palestinians in most of the west bank, evicted families are not rehoused or compensated. So, those evicted would face homelessness and destitution were it not for relatives, friends and charities. Palestinians in East Jerusalem fare little better under the Israeli civil authorities. .Violations of the right to adequate housing experienced by Palestinians in the oPt are both a symptom of the wider human rights violations to which Palestinians are subject and a barrier to their achievement of other human rights.. .As the occupying power, the actions of Israel in the oPt are also bound by the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in time of War to which Israel is a signatory.

{{rfcquote|text=
How should Fury's nationality be described?
This is still not resolved and there is an edit war going on regarding his nationality. I propose he be listed as Irish / British, with Irish being the predominant nationality. The reasons? He fights with Irish colours (green shorts and shamrock) and this article clearly states that he considers himself Irish: http://www.irishcentral.com/sports/tyson-fury-en-route-to-msg-says-i-fight-for-ireland-i-am-no-plastic-paddy-202301431-237579631.html

He vacated all British titles to compete for the Irish titles and abandoned all his connections with representing Britain to represent Ireland (and you must hold an Irish passport to do so), as that is his chosen nationality.

Ok... Fury was born and raised in Manchester to Mancunian parents. That makes him British primarily. Surely he can't be listed as Irish because his great, great, great grandfather was from Ireland? Hell, if he was Irish, wouldn't he be fighting in Ireland all the time? He's only fought once in Ireland. If anything he should be listed as British from Irish descent. Boxrec and The Ring both have him listed as British also. [[Special:Contributions/85.210.140.255|85.210.140.255]] ([[User talk:85.210.140.255|talk]]) 19:34, 22 June 2015 (UTC)}}

*I think to call Serbian Cyrillic simply Cyrillic is breaking [[WP:NPOV]] — note that omitters instead call the use of "Serbian Cyrillic" to be Serbian POV. An example is [[Vraneševići]] ({{lang-sr-cyr|Вранешевићи}}), which has the letter [[Tshe]] (Ћħ/Ćć), which is {{underline|only used in Serbian}}; in Bulgarian Cyrillic and Russian Cyrillic, [[Tshe]] is non-existant, and would instead be [[Che (Cyrillic)|Che]] (Чч) — Serbian Cyrillic and other Cyrillic alphabets are not identical, so why is there a need for omitting Serbian?--[[User_talk:Zoupan|Z<small>oupan</small>]] 02:12, 25 May 2015 (UTC)}}

{{mslink|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Chronological items|Dates, months and years|Strong national ties to a topic}} ([[MOS:DATETIES]]) says:  {{User:sroc/box||2=
* Articles on topics with strong ties to a particular English-speaking country should generally use the date format most commonly used in that nation. For the United States, this is month before day; for most others it is day before month. Articles related to Canada may use either format, with (as always) consistency within any one article.
* In some topic areas the customary format differs from the usual national one: for example, {{highlight|articles on the modern US military use day before month, in accordance with military usage}}.}}

This wording is ambiguous whether articles on US military personnel should use month–day–year (MDY) format, as is standard for general articles about the US, or day–month–year (DMY) format, as applies to other US military topics.  As noted above, there is mixed usage in articles on current/recent military personnel: the trend seems to be towards MDY format, but it is unclear whether this is due to editors assuming this applies to all US-based topics without being aware of the exception for the military.  There are some articles that use a mix of both formats interchangably, which is undesirable, but it is hard to know which format should be preferred in this context.  Some clarification of the above wording to explicitly state whether it applies to articles on specific military personnel would be welcome.  <small>—'''[[User:sroc|sroc]]'''&nbsp;[[User talk:sroc|&#x1F4AC;]]</small> 08:53, 25 May 2015 (UTC)}}

I hereby submit a proposal to be reviewed by the community.

The reasons for this proposal are simple. The essay in question has attained a level of currency across Wikipedia that punches above the weight of an "essay". It is commonly cited by administrators during the course of their duties to halt edit warring. It is the most apt tool that we have to encourage discussion. It is clearly an example of a Wikipedia "best practice", which is how guidelines are defined by the policy on such matters. As such, it has proven that it is worthy of guideline status.

These conclusions represent the consensus of the scientific evidence surveyed by the ICSU (2003) and they are consistent with the views of the World Health Organization (WHO, 2002). These foods have been assessed for increased risks to human health by several national regulatory authorities (inter alia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and the United States) using their national food safety procedures (ICSU). To date no verifiable untoward toxic or nutritionally deleterious effects resulting from the consumption of foods derived from genetically modified crops have been discovered anywhere in the world (GM Science Review Panel). Many millions of people have consumed foods derived from GM plants – mainly maize, soybean and oilseed rape – without any observed adverse effects (ICSU).<p>"The lack of evidence of negative effects, however, does not mean that new transgenic foods are without risk (ICSU, GM Science Review Panel). Scientists acknowledge that not enough is known about the long-term effects of transgenic (and most traditional) foods. It will be difficult to detect long-term effects because of many confounding factors such as the underlying genetic variability in foods and problems in assessing the impacts of whole foods. Furthermore, newer, more complex genetically transformed foods may be more difficult to assess and may increase the possibility of unintended effects. New profiling or 'fingerprinting' tools may be useful in testing whole foods for unintended changes in composition (ICSU)."</ref><ref name=Other>Other sources:

In discussion above, there seems to be consensus that the guidelines should be clarified to clearly recommend a single shiplist page for each ship name, and that there should be a common title style.  But no consensus yet on a preferred common title style.  Most prefer a title that begins with the ship name then a dab, such as [[Ulysses (ship name)]], [[Ulysses (ship index)]] or [[Ulysses (list of ships)]] (and I would be happy with any of these three), in order to assist searches from the drop-down menu, though a more descriptive title, such as [[List of ships named Ulysses]], has also been proposed. Which is generally preferred? [[User:Davidships|Davidships]] ([[User talk:Davidships|talk]]) 09:59, 30 May 2015 (UTC)}}

Tesla's citizenship from 1867 to 1891 is an unresolved question. Should it be stated as Croatian-Hungarian national citizenship with local citizenship of Croatia-Slavonia. Also, should Croatian-Slavonian local citizenship from 1861 to 1867 be stated.

The purposed change is:

Citizenship:
*Austrian national citizenship (1856 – 1867), Croatian-Slavnonian local citizenship (1861 - 1867)

*Croatian-Hungarian national citizenship , Croatian - Slavonian local citizenship (1867 - 1891)

*United States (30 July 1891 – 7 January 1943)

The fact is: Croatia was conquered by Hungarians in 1102 and remained as a Hungarian province until 1918 (Turkish rule over Hungary included).

'''Proposal of the new article title:''' Croatia under Hungarian and Turkish rule, or Croatia 1096-1526

'''Proposal of complete rework: ''' As we see from the works of John V. A. Fine and of Alex J. Bellamy, the whole medieval history of of the region of today's Croatia is poorly sourced, based on (seventeenth- and eighteenth-century) narrative histories. Hungarian and Serbian historians are firm in their stance: Croatia was subdued by Hungarians by the arms. The much advertised 'Pacta Conventa' turned to be a fourteen-century fake. The article as written follows the nationalistic bias and the narrative histories. All together, heavily biased current text of this article shall be shortened and replaced by the new one that show, at least, the two opposing views evenhandedly.

From the article:

:''Croatia had its own local governor, or Ban; a privileged landowning nobility; and an assembly of nobles, the Sabor.[32]'' 

From serious academic sources:

:'''The Millennium of Hungary and Its People edited by József Jekelfalussy Pesti könyvnyomda-részvénytársaság, 1897'''

:Page 230: ''However it is only the affairs of Religious service and Public instruction which in their fullest extent belong to the province of territorial autonomy whereas in the province of home affairs with regard to questions of association, of passports, of police supervision over foreigners, of the rights of citizenship, and of naturalization, the executive only belongs to the autonomy; while the legislation on these subjects is a common one. For this reason there is also no separate Croatian citizenship.''

:Pages 234-235: ''The organization of the Croatia-Slavonian-Dalmatian National Assembly is on the basis of the one chamber system and the principle of indirect votes for the great part:''

...

:''Deputies are chosen according to districts, i.e. every district chooses a deputy. The conditions for the possession of a vote are (a) Hungarian citizenship; (b) the fact of belonging to a Croatian-Slavonian community ...''

:'''Catholic World, Volume 109, Paulist Fathers, 1919'''

:Pages 349-350: ''Hungarian writers assert that Croatia was reduced by force of arms. She lost entirely autonomous life and was incorporated as a conquered province in the Hungarian kingdom. "An independent Croatia is an historical absurdity," writes C. M. Knatchbull-Hugessen. "Croatian citizeship is a myth. The king of Hungary is at the same time the king of Croatia". "From a political point of view,' writes Jellinck, "Croatia and Slavonia are nothing than fully equipped provinces of Hungary"''

:'''The Political Evolution of the Hungarian Nation, Volume 2 by Cecil Marcus Knatchbull-Hugessen Brabourne (4th Baron) National Review Office, 1908'''

:Pages 312-313: ''The Habsburg who is crowned King of Hungary, ipso facto becomes King of Croatia - an indivisible part of the realms of the Sacred Crown, so expressed by the laws of 1723 and 1868. The Ban does not come in direct contact with the King, as he would necessarily do if he were the chief official of an independent State, but communicates with the Crown through the Croatian member of the Hungarian Ministry, who is responsible to the Hungarian Parliament, whose countersignature is necessary to give validity to the countersignature of the Ban of official nominations and other royal acts. Further the Ban himself is nominated by the Magyar Prime Minister, who countersigns the royal appointment made in pursuance of such nomination. There are no Croatian or Hungaro-Croatian Ministers or Parliament within the realms of St. Stephen. Parliament is Hungarian, and the Ministers are Hungarians servants of an indivisible State of which Croatia-Slavonia forms an integral part. There is no Croatian citizenship or nationality. As a member of the Sacred Crown Croatia was affected by the results of the Compromise of 1867, and as such member would have no power of independent action should the law of that year be abrogated or modified, save in so far as it is entitled and enabled to make its voice heard through its delegates to the Hungarian Parliament should a revision of Compromise affect its local or common interest, or necessitate an alteration of financial relations with Hungary on whom Croatia's insolvent autonomy lays a considerable burden.''

:'''The Early Medieval Balkans: a critical survey from the sixth to the late twelfth century by John Van Antwerp Fine - Published 1991 by University of Michigan Press'''

:Page 248 ''Sources on Medieval Croatia Early medieval Croatian history fits the concluding line to the old jingle: the more you study the less you know. When I was and undergraduate studying Balkan history I thought I knew quite a bit about Croatia; but as I study more about Croatia, one by one "facts" that I knew before turn out to be dubious, based on questionable sources or no sources at all. Most of the existing literature in western languages on medieval Croatia is extremely poor; and frequently it is marred by nationalistic bias. Much of the information about medieval Croatian history comes from later (seventeenth- and eighteenth-century) narrative histories. These were written by enthusiastic people but contain a mixture of fact and legend; and since many of the documents they based their works on are now lost, it is extremely difficult to judge whether their information came from reliable source or not.''

:'''The Realm of St Stephen: A History of Medieval Hungary, 895-1526 by Pál Engel - 2005 I.B.Tauris edition, Translated by Tamas Palosfalvi'''

:Pages 33-34 ''One of Ladislaus's most significant achievements was the occupation of Hungary's southern neighbour, Croatia. ... The small kngdom, born in the tenth century, stretched from the Kapela mountains to the Adriatic sea, its center being Biograd, located on the coast. ... King Demetrius Zvonimir, who, not being a member of the ruling dynasty, obtained his throne through election, asked Pope Gregory VII fo a crown in 1075, and, in return, declared his kingdom as a papal fief. After his death, Ladislaus laid claim on his realm by the right of his sister, Zvonimir's widow, and had no difficulty in taking possession of Croatia in 1091. He bestowed the new kingdom, together with royal title, on his nephew, Almos, son of Geza I ''

:'''A Short History of Yugoslavia from Early Times to 1966 by Stephen Clissold, Henry Clifford Darby CUP Archive, 1968'''
:Page 37: ''The official language of the state was recognized as Serbo-Croat. Hungary, moreover, promised to help Croatia to obtain both Dalmatia and Military Frontier Province, still under Austrian control. The latter territory, after many delays, was incorporated in Croatia in 1881, but Dalmatia remained Austrian until 1918.''

:''Despite this 'Home Rule', the Croats never felt they had achieved adequate self-government. Their Ban was appointed by the Crown (but on the nomination of Hungarian prime minister) and he was responsible to a Hungarian Minister of Sate in the Hungarian cabinet. The Croat Sabor was represented in the Hungarian Parliament by forty members in the Lower House (out of a total of about 453), and by only three members in the Upper House (out of a total of about 400)''

:'''The Formation of Croatian National Identity: A Centuries-old Dream by  Alex J. Bellamy Manchester University Press, 2003'''

:The Croatian Historical Statehood Narative

:Page 37. ''It is argued that in 1102 the Croatian nobles signed an agreement - the Pacta Conventa - with Coloman, King of Hungary. The agreement confirmed the legitimacy of Koloman's succession to the Croatian throne in return for which Koloman agreed to respect the laws and customs of Croatia. The exact nature of the agreement, and even its existence, is impossible to determine as historians believe that a transcript of the Pacta Conventa preserved in the city of Trogir is actually a fourteen-century fake. There are two competing accounts of the nature of the union, one emerging predominantly from Croat historians and the other from Magyar and Serbian historians. The Croats argue that the union was a personal one in the form of a shared king, while the Magyars and Serbs insist that Croatia was conquered.''

:''The next 'signpost' of the Croatian historical statehood narrative is 1526 and the defeat of Hungary by the Ottoman Turks, which prompted Croatia's entry into the Habsburg empire. Again, the Croatian historical narrative insists that the decision to join the Habsburg empire was the result of a free choice made by Sabor.''

'''POV'''

:'''Point 1'''. The existing text does not discriminate opinions and history narratives and documented history in the sense done by Van Antwerp Fine and Bellamy.
:'''Point 2''': 'Some of the terms of Coloman's coronation and the later status of the Croatian nobles are detailed in the Pacta Conventa, a document preserved only in transcript from the 14th century.' - this sentence cannot be in the introductory for knowing that 'Pacta Conventa' was a fourteen-century fake
:'''Point 3''': Section Name is supported exclusively by Croatian history narratives (Margetic , Sisic, Dzoic) seen only as narratives by Bellamy and Fine
:'''Point 4'''  'Croatian historians hold that the union was a personal one in the form of a shared king, a view also accepted by a number of Hungarian historians,[11][15][21][22][23][24] while Serbian and Hungarian nationalist historians preferred to see it as a form of annexation.[19][25][26]' Who marked or disqualified those  'Serbian and Hungarian nationalist historians'? This is a Wikipedia user point of view. See Bellamy who is exclusive in claiming two sides: Croatian and Hungarian and Serbian where the first ones (Croatian) are marked as nationalistic and non-scholar by Fine.Kristo Gyula was falsely linked to supporters of non-existent union. His article actually refutes that idea (reference [21]) Marta Font is a Croatian author (reference[22]).
:'''Point 5''': Croatia as actually a duchy not as a kingdom: Fine, The Late Medieval Balkans, page 22: ''From the late 1190s Croatia and Slavonia were under the Duke of Croatia. The office was usually filled by a son or brother oh the Hungarian king The dukes coined their own money and, as the king deputies, ran their duchy (which was also still known as the Kingdom of Croatia) like kings, presiding over a court and entourage modelled on the Hungarian royal court. Under the duke stood a ban or governor.''
:'''Point 6''' ''Today, Hungarian legal historians hold that the relationship of Hungary with the area of Croatia and Dalmatia in the period till 1526 and the death of Louis II was most similar to a personal union,[24][28] resembling the relationship of Scotland to England.[29][30]'' makes no sense for being refuted by many other Hungarian historians. The 'resembling the relationship of Scotland to England' is completely false for today's Scotland is not a feudal duchy to England, does not have viceroy subordinated to an English royal family member. We see that disobedient Croatian nobles were military crushed by Hungarians and their lands taken over by Hungarian nobles.
:'''Point 6''': Language Slavic vs. forged 'Croatian': from When Ethnicity Did Not Matter in the Balkans: A Study of Identity in Pre-Nationalist Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia in the Medieval and Early-Modern Periods by John V. A. Fine Jr. University of Michigan Press, Mar 2, 200 page 150
:''Thus clearly by the early sixteenth century no feeling of commonality had developed among the Slavonian nobles for Croatia''

:''What language did people speak in Dalmatia and 'Velebitia' 1102-1500?''

:''We have already seen that there the language was called "Slavic" without exception throughout the Middle Ages. Pope Alexander III visited Zadar in 1177 an the crowd that awaited him sang/chanted for hi in their Slavic language''

:''For some reas0o Klaic's translation renders it "Croatian language' but she supplies the phrase (which I quote) in the Latin original which says "Slavic language"''

:''A Venetian document from 1346 also refers to the people of Zadar speaking Slavic (lingua sclavonica)''

'''Question:''' should [[WP:PRIMARY]] be updated to define news sources as primary, aligning more closely with the definition used by historians?

''' Background '''

Our policy limits how [[primary sources]] can be used, particularly regarding [[WP:BLPPRIMARY|living people]]. Exactly what constitutes a primary vs secondary source is subject to some debate; for example, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:No_original_research&oldid=665293170 current version] of our policy defines secondary sources as those that ''contain an author's interpretation, analysis, or evaluation of the facts, evidence, concepts, and ideas taken from primary sources.'' Primary sources are defined as personal accounts such as witness statements. Historians, in contrast, define contemporary news sources as primary - discussed, for example, [http://research.library.gsu.edu/primaryhistory here].

At [[Talk:Dennis Hastert]] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dennis_Hastert&oldid=667441752#Closing permalink]), the latter definition is being applied. Because of the substantial impact to our sourcing practices if news sources are now considered primary at Wikipedia, our new practice should be updated in [[WP:NOR]]. Proposed revised wording of [[WP:PRIMARY]] follows:

{{collapse top|Before/after wording}}
Current wording:
* '''[[Primary source]]s''' are original materials that are close to an event, and are often accounts written by people who are directly involved. They offer an insider's view of an event, a period of history, a work of art, a political decision, and so on. Primary sources may or may not be [[Wikipedia:Independent sources|independent or third-party sources]].  An account of a traffic accident written by a witness is a primary source of information about the accident; similarly, a scientific paper documenting a new experiment conducted by the author is a primary source on the outcome of that experiment. Historical documents such as diaries are primary sources.

Proposed wording:
* '''[[Primary source]]s''' are original materials that are close to or published in the same historical context as an event, and are often accounts written by people who are directly involved. They offer an insider's view of an event, a period of history, a work of art, a political decision, and so on. Primary sources may or may not be [[Wikipedia:Independent sources|independent or third-party sources]].  An account of a traffic accident written by a witness is a primary source of information about the accident; similarly, a scientific paper documenting a new experiment conducted by the author is a primary source on the outcome of that experiment. Historical documents such as diaries and contemporary sources such as newspaper articles and news reports are primary sources.

I do not know If I'm asking this in the wrong place but I'll ask anyway. I would like neutral opinions on this matter, from the people who did not participate in the discussion where this question is mentioned. 

If the following claim SYNTHESIS?

*A= "10 red apples are in a bowl, named a,b,c..etc" 
*B= "we know all apples are red"
*A+B="apple named c is red"

Another example:

We know the following is correct.
*A="all members states of EU voted on the subject S" 
*B="the subject S was sustained unanimously". 
*C="Germany is EU member state" 

Does the following statement constitutes SYNTHESIS?

*A+B+C = "Germany had voted in favor of subject S"

Can an article state the claim A+B+C based on separate claims A,B,C if we know those claims (sources) are correct. Note that there is not a single source that says anything specifically about Germany and its vote. 

Furthermore, if we know A and B and we have a source that specifies the claim for apple c in the following was "apple c is red". Do the sources complement the source stating that apple c is red or are they completely irrelevant. 

Furthermore, although we ( I presume, depends on the previous question) can't use the source B (together with A) to make an edit "apple c is red", because of SYNTHESIS. Can we use it to verify the other source that states: "apple c is green"? Can we, based on source B that says "all apples are red" ,which is undeniably correct, say that the source "apple c is green" (which has no footnote or any other clarification or argumentation in the new source) is not correct enough to enter the article, because it directly contradicts the stronger claim that "all apples are red". That would mean we have 2 sources and neither one can be used in the article, because they cancel each other. In the other case it would mean that source that states "apple c is green" can enter the article although the source expressing that claim has no footnotes or any other argument to sustain the claim, and it furthermore contradicts the undeniable claim "we know all apples are red".

There are several [[:Category:Templates using data from Wikidata|templates using data from Wikidata]], and likely to be more in the future, but finding out where the data comes from or how to edit such data can be confusing for editors ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk%3AOfficial_website&type=revision&diff=664823639&oldid=660790274 example]). One solution is to have "edit in Wikidata" links – similar to how some templates such as navboxes have {{tl|Navbar}} links (view, talk, and edit that template). A template can be created so "edit in Wikidata" links are easy to add to other templates, and have appropriate CSS classes, such as a draft version I started at [[User:Evad37/sandbox/Template:Edit wikidata]] (which may not be the final version/formatting, but gives an indication of what is possible).

This RFC is to determine consensus on whether such links should be '''allowed''' or '''prohibited''' in templates using data from Wikidata.

Further details dependent on "edit in wikidata" links being allowed (eg formatting, and whether such links should be required or merely allowed) can be decided on in a future RFC. - <u>'''[[User:Evad37|Evad]]''37'''''</u>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:95%;">&#91;[[d:w:User talk:Evad37|talk]]]</span> 01:27, 3 June 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
WikiProjects are often sorted into categories of the variety "[Something] WikiProjects". WikiProjects also frequently have their own categories; for example, [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography]] has a corresponding [[:Category:WikiProject Biography]]. I tend to refer to the former categories as "meta-categories" and the latter as "self-named categories". I have found that categorization of WikiProjects into appropriate meta-categories is inconsistent. Some projects have meta-categories on both the project page and the self-named categories; others have them just on the self-named categories, and some projects have different categories between the project pages and the self-named categories. It varies from project to project, and I apologize for contributing to this inconsistency.

I propose that for the WikiProjects that have their own categories, that meta-categories are only sorted into the category and not the project page itself. For example, [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography]], currently sorted under [[:Category:WikiProject Biography]] and [[:Category:Society WikiProjects]], would only be sorted under [[:Category:WikiProject Biography]], and that category would be sorted under [[:Category:Society WikiProjects]]. It makes the (much-needed) categorization effort easier, since categories will only need to be assigned in one place. '''I am volunteering to write a bot to enforce this.'''

I open this up for discussion. [[User:Harej|Harej]] ([[User talk:Harej|talk]]) 03:19, 5 June 2015 (UTC)}}

This is to take a small bit of middle-ground writing in the lede but without diminishing the implications or weight of sources: 
* Currently {{green|The campaign was coordinated in the online forums of Reddit, 4chan, and 8chan '''in''' an anonymous and amorphous movement that ultimately came to be represented by the Twitter hashtag #gamergate.}}
* Suggested {{green|The campaign was coordinated in the online forums of Reddit, 4chan, and 8chan '''by members of''' an anonymous and amorphous movement that ultimately came to be represented by the Twitter hashtag #gamergate.}}
This change still keeps the harassment charged to the GG movement, but leaves the question of how many of the movement was involved without getting into the details/nuances of the makeup. It also leaves the question opened of the origins of the movement without denying the possibility of it being created purposely as a harassment campaign (as opposed to the ethics as our sources also offer).

Also while on the lede, I know why we have the list of RSes in the lede about those sources that are debunking the ethics claims (editors were demanding sources), but I really think that looks sloppy, and would be all in favor of its removal, or perhaps moving that list to the start of the section about ethics. That way the list is still "right there" for someone to review. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 19:22, 19 June 2015 (UTC)}}

Part of correcting the RfA process is to keep it as a matter relegated to the Wikipedia community and not open to the general public. IPs fall into the latter category...if they want to become members of our community then they need an account. [[Wikipedia:IP addresses are not people]] as an essay states that IPs may not participate in RfA at all but under the heading ''Expressing opinions'' on the main RfA page, it states  "All Wikipedians—including those without an account or not logged in ("anons")—are welcome to comment and ask questions in an RfA..." <== That needs to be removed. IPs are not Wikipedians because they have chosen to edit but ''not join'' our community. I have no problem with IPs editing and commenting in article space and other places on the Wiki but participation in RfA needs to be confined as a benefit to those who have actually joined our community. That would go a long way towards preventing the disruption in this process. IPs commenting here are generally [[WP:IPSOCK|IP socks]], indeffed/banned editors or possibly legitimate editors [[WP:SCRUTINY|avoiding scrutiny]].

I would like to see the main RfA page amended to exclude IPs and "new" editors.

I propose that the guideline be changed to something along the lines of: "Providing that there are at least two or three active blue links in navigation boxes, it is acceptable to have a number of red links. Red links can indicate that important articles are missing and be a productive way of inviting readers to build content and fill them. However, an excessive number of red links which far exceed the number of blue links is ill-advised, and editors should refrain from adding excessive red links to templates unless they are actively working through them and intend to fill them all.  12:44, 17 June 2015 (UTC)}}

This RfC seeks to establish consensus on the question: should experienced non-administrators be allowed to close TfD discussions with uncontroversial '''delete''' outcomes? 

# Currently, the backlog at [[WP:TFD]] is so large that the [[Wikipedia:Template limits|transclusion limit]] on the page has been exceeded. Very few admins are currently active in TfD closures. Many TfD discussions are uncontroversial deletions.
# The purpose of [[WP:NAC|non-admin closures]] of discussions is to reduce, not merely displace, admin backlogs. Per [[WP:NACD]]: "Non-administrators should not close discussions in which they lack the technical ability to act upon the outcome, such as deletion." This is particularly important at AfD, where deletion decisions are immediately actionable.
# At TfD, deletion decisions are ''not'' necessarily immediately actionable. When a discussion is closed as '''delete''', the template in question must first be orphaned. This is within the technical ability of, and is often completed by, non-admins.
# After being orphaned, the template is listed at [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Holding cell#Ready for deletion]] to await admin action.
# As a result of this structure, non-admin closures of discussions with uncontroversial '''delete''' outcomes would reduce the backlog at [[WP:TFD]] and permit admins active in TfD closures to concentrate on more complex cases, while still allowing a final admin review of the decision before the template is deleted.

Consensus in ''favor'' of this proposal would interpret the [[WP:NACD]] guideline as permitting '''delete''' closures of uncontroversial discussions by experienced editors where enacting the short-term outcome is within the technical ability of non-administrators.

This RfC asks the community for input on how spouse names should be displayed in the infoboxes on biography articles. A discussion about this occurred previously and can be seen above. 

Should the spouse parameter of biography infoboxes contain (1) the person's pre-marriage name if different than current name (linked to article using [[WP:PIPE|piping]] if necessary), (2) the person's current name/current article title, or (3) something else?

Currently there appears to be a mix of how this is handled. For example, [[Barack Obama]] and [[Stephan Colbert]] have their spouses' current names whereas [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.]] and [[Howard Taft]] have their spouses' pre-marriage ("maiden") names.

The first line of the lead of the [[Israel]] article notes the English, Arabic, and Hebrew transliterations of the name along with their IPAs.  Consequently, the first line is heavily cluttered.  About three quarters of the line is text that most of our readership will not be able to understand.  Most of our readers do not speak Arabic or Hebrew or understand IPA.  I submitted a motion to clear the first line of this text, perhaps moving the material to some other section of the article.  I noticed that the infobox in the top-right of the article already has the Hebrew and Arabic translations of "State of Israel", so I see no need for them to be in the first sentence of the lead.

It was pointed out to me that this is a problem that appears across many articles concerning countries with multiple official languages, such as [[Switzerland]].  Since the issue is widespread, I would like some external comments.  These articles all seem to be in violation of [[WP:LEADCLUTTER]].[[User:Kurzon|Kurzon]] ([[User talk:Kurzon|talk]]) 03:23, 19 June 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
A controversy between myself and [[User:Esszet]] about the use of non-free multiple covers in music albums articles started while editing ''[[Shades of Deep Purple]]'' and was discussed in [[Talk:Shades of Deep Purple#Cover dispute]]. With the contribution of other editors, what came out of the discussion was the lack of a clear rule for the use of covers in [[Template:Infobox album|infobox]] and [[Template:Extra album cover|extra album cover]] templates. [[Template:Infobox album]] recites "An image of the official front cover of the original version of the album (or a reissue, if no original cover can be found) should be included at Cover". Assuming that with some research on the Internet more than 99% of original covers can be retrieved, I think that the words "official" and "original" need some clarification, because there are too many examples of random use of covers in the articles. Here are some criteria used in album articles which emerged from the discussion:
#Temporal criterion: On top of the infobox there is the cover of the very first edition, regardless of country, support (vinyl, CD) or popularity. Other notable covers should go in the extra album cover template. 
#Artist's intent criterion: The main cover should be the one that the artist wanted to be considered official, regardless of time of release or record label decisions, and other editions relegated to the extra template. The editors should try to discern the artist's intention or... 
#Country of origin criterion: ...select the main cover depending on the artist's country of origin, assuming that he had more control in his home country of the final output. 
#Popularity criterion: The cover on top of the infobox is simply the best known and most popular, implying that more recent CD reissues or editions with larger print runs should be chosen. 
In my edits I always used the first criterion, often reversing the placement of covers selected with different standards, but this is not a universally accepted behavior. For example, ''[[Led Zeppelin (album)| Led Zeppelin]]'' and many [[Loudness (band)|Loudness]] discography articles  should follow the first or third criterion, but sport the most popular covers instead. ''[[Out of Our Heads]]'' apparently follows the third criterion, ''[[Open Up and Say... Ahh!]]'' the first and second and so on. Wouldn't it be better to have only one standard for cover selection? I would really appreciate some input on the matter by other editors and maybe reach a consensus to better define the use of covers.

{{rfcquote|text=
As the issue of when to use, or swap, the terms "gay" and "homosexual" to describe a living or deceased person is a perennial subject (as per the archive links above), it seems worth setting down a standard in project level guidelines.

I propose the following basic text be added as a new section to [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_LGBT_studies#Guidelines]], with its own easy to remember shortcut (perhaps [[WP:gay?]]) to refer to in future discussions for preferred style:

{{divbox|green||
;When to use ''gay'' or ''homosexual''{{shortcut|WP:Gay?}}
When describing a living person, their documented preference for a description of sexual orientation should be used as a default. Where a self description is unavailable, ''gay'' or ''lesbian'' is preferred to ''homosexual'' in articles about living people. For historical articles, ''homosexual'' can be used as an accurate adjective describing the subject if roughly dating events before 1970, though discussing influence on modern gay culture may be appropriate. Generally ''homosexual'' should be confined to descriptions of sexual activity or clinical orientation.

Examples from independent style guides:
# The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage, 5th Edition, 2015, ISBN 9780812963892: "gay (adj.) is preferred over 'homosexual' in most contexts. Generally confine 'homosexual' to specific references to sexual activity or clinical orientation."
# CDC/Emerging Infectious Diseases journal, Editorial Style Guide, 2015: "homosexual, bisexual, gay ... Using these terms as adjectives is acceptable, as in “gay men,” and dependent on the author's discretion. However, avoid using these terms as nouns as they may too vague or perceived as perjorative. Sometimes the phrase “men who have sex with men” or MSM is used because some of these men do not label themselves as gay, homosexual, or bisexual."[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/pdfs/StyleGuide.pdf]
# Associated Press Style Book, 2013, ISBN 9780465082995: "Gay ... Preferred over 'homosexual' except in clinical contexts or references to sexual activity"
# The Canadian Press Stylebook, 2013: "Sexuality ... Gay is usually preferred as an alternative for homosexual men and is also commonly used for women, although lesbian is preferred by many women."[http://www.ucalgary.ca/news/styleguide]
# BBC News style guide, 2002: "Gay ... some people believe the word "homosexual" has negative overtones, even that it is demeaning. Most homosexual men and women prefer the words "gay" and "lesbian". Either word is acceptable as an alternative to homosexual, but "gay" should be used only as an adjective."[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/radio_newsroom/1099593.stm]

Significant mass changes of articles from ''gay'' to ''homosexual'' or the reverse, require a supporting specific consensus or are likely to be viewed as [[WP:POINT|disruptive]].

Are album reviews reliable, in general practice, for establishing the style of an artist? Does a source have to mention both that artist's Christianity and the style they play in order to be considered a Christian artist performing a particular style? Is a mention of an artist in a review of a different artist's work reliable for the first artist's genre? Should styles even be included on this list? Does a mention of a style on one album justify inclusion of the artist on this list?

{{U|Synthwave.94}} and myself have gotten into a dispute, in which {{u|Metalworker14}} and {{U|The Cross Bearer}} unfortunately have gotten thrown into out of no intent of their own, over how this article should be sourced. The current version is the version Synthwave.94 established when he put in a refimprove tag. I reverted this, because the consensus was that not every entry needs a citation as long as all entries are verifiable. However, the consequent editing and attempt to restructure and re-citation the list has gotten myself and Synthwave.94 into an impasse. They insist on a particular way of sourcing the list, and while I agree with much of their work, I think that their narrow approach is not the consensus of the community. This editor has gotten blocked before due to genre warring on [[Den Harrow]] and [[Baltimora]], though they have greatly improved in their editing style since then. I myself was involved in those disputes, and have also gotten into similar genre disputes (not involving Synthwave), in which I edit warred, on [[Amon Amarth]] and [[Viking metal]].

Basically, the questions are these:
* Are album reviews reliable, in general practice, for establishing the style of an artist? I grant that in some cases a style may appear only on an album and/or not be representative of the artist's overall work. If that is the case, how do we determine that?
* Does a source have to mention both that artist's Christianity and the style they play in order to be listed? If one source describes an artist as Christian, or using Christian themes, and another describes them as "rock" or metal," and there's no real dispute that either source is wrong (the first is right that the artist is Christian, the second that they are rock or metal, is it not a reasonable inference that the artist in question could be listed on the rock or metal list? The consensus has been on this and other Christian musician lists that this is not [[WP:SYNTH|original synthesis]] but a reasonable inference.
* Is a mention of an artist in a review of a different artist's work reliable for the first artist's genre? Example: is a review saying "this album is a similar alternative metal style as performed by ''x'' artist" reliable for labeling ''x'' artist as alternative metal.
* Should styles even be included on this list? This discussion goes back five years to when I first started editing on Wikipedia. There have been versions of this page that have included specific styles (as the [[list of Christian rock bands]] does), and versions that have excluded this.
* Does a mention of a style on one album justify inclusion on that style's artist list? Right now, the lead states "including bands that played Christian metal at some point in their careers." Should this be changed so as to narrow down which artists are included?--[[User:3family6|<font color="navy">'''3family6'''</font>]] ([[User talk:3family6|<font color="black"><u>Talk to me</u></font>]] &#124; <small>[[Special:Contributions/3family6|<font color="purple">See what I have done</font>]]</small>) 03:23, 14 June 2015 (UTC)}}

'''I propose that MOS should formally deprecate the "In popular culture" heading.'''  As detailed at the long-standing [[Wikipedia:"In popular culture" content]] essay, this heading is often inaccurate and misleading, and it directly inspires the addition of [[WP:Handling trivia|pointless, trivial cruft]] that often violates the [[WP:Core content policies]], and various guidelines.

The most popular alternatives to "In popular culture" are heading "Cultural references", "Cultural impact", "Cultural influence", "In culture", and sometimes medium- or genre-specific approaches are used, e.g. "In fiction", etc.  I'd like us to discuss what the best approaches are, and agree on a default recommendation (or a few recommendations depending on article type/scope).  [[MOS:TRIVIA]] now recommends writing such sections as prose paragraphs, not lists, and integrating this material into the main flow the article instead of having such a section to begin with, but I think we all know they will never entirely go away. In some articles, they are actually the most practical approach to such material.

I '''propose that we combine the best parts of the [[WP:Handling trivia]] ([[WP:HTRIV]]) and [[WP:"In popular culture" content]] ([[WP:POPCULTURE]]) essays, and work them into a formal [[WP:Proposal]] for a content guideline on ''relevance''.'''. These two essays taken together are the closest thing we have to a guideline on encyclopedic relevance (other than brief style guidance at [[MOS:TRIVIA]]).  This might or might not entail a [[WP:Merge]], depending on how much material will turn out to be guideline-worthy vs. too essay-ish in nature even after attempts to reword it.

There is no question that the Wikipedia community has a general consensus on the handling (mostly rejection) of trivia, and on the fact that not all popular culture material is trivial, and that material on cultural influence/impact is a necessary part of encyclopedic coverage of a topic.  The material would need some revision (for sarcasm and other essay-tone issues) or could be written up anew from an outline; a balancing of prescriptiveness (which will be the most controversial/difficult part); and programmatically illustrative examples, like other guidelines provide.  The effort should also probably pull key points from [[WP:Out of scope]], [[WP:Relevance emerges]], [[WP:Relevance of content]], [[WP:What claims of relevance are false]], [[WP:Coatrack]], and [[WP:Indirect relevance is sometimes OK]]. Many of these are long-standing essays with some well-accepted advice, rationales, and best practices.  The eventual proposal, if accepted, would be tagged with {{tlx|Subcat guideline|content guideline}}, and could usurp the [[Wikipedia:Relevance]] ([[WP:RELEVANCE]]) disambiguation page.

On example material: I already added some rubrics, with examples, to WP:POPCULTURE yesterday to give a more general approach to avoiding pitfalls associated with pop-culture sections, since the extant material was mostly highly specific examples. The two extended "good" ''xkcd'' examples that essay gives are highly unusual, and don't really represent what is typically found in such sections when they appear, well written, in good articles.  It's often more like "was the subject of a three-part BBC documentary called ...", "was used in the soundtrack of the film ...", "lead to a national-level scandal in ...", etc.  Notable stuff, but not as {{em|clever geeky insider}} as the extant examples the essay gives (though I wouldn't drop them, just add more typical ones). Some of the example material in the WP:HTRIV is better, though (due to the wider scope) necessarily more general in form.

I advocate a descriptive as much as prescriptive/restrictive approach: Codify existing best practices, rather than introduce new rules against this or that kind of alleged trivia.

I'm soliciting:
# Community opinion on whether to proceed with this plan; and
# Ideas on how to go about it.

[[User:PakSol]] uses the following piece of newspaper text:
<blockquote>''Modi said the establishment of Bangladesh was a desire of every Indian citizen and that was why Indian forces fought along with the Mukti Bahini, thus creating a new country. Modi recalled his participation in the Jana Sangh campaign backing Mukti Bahini in former East Pakistan as he accepted a ‘liberation war’ honour on behalf of former Indian premier Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Mr Modi also said he was one of the young volunteers who came to Delhi in 1971 to participate in the Satyagraha Movement launched by Jana Sangh as a volunteer to garner support for the Mukti Bahini members. Modi also admitted that there had been a conspiracy to divide Pakistan.''<ref>{{cite news |title=Pakistan Urges UN to Take Note of Modi's Remark on 1971 War |newspaper=[[The New Indian Express]] |date=10 June 2015 |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/Pakistan-Urges-UN-to-Take-Note-of-Modis-Remark-on-1971-War/2015/06/10/article2859365.ece}}</ref></blockquote>
as the citation for the following claims:
*"Establishment of Bangladesh was a desire of every Indian and that was why Indian forces were fighting along with the Mukti Bahini"
*"The Mukti Bahini became increasingly active, primarily because India’s forces fought along with the Mukti Bahini (between March and June)."

[[User:Volunteer Marek]] thinks, the reference does not support the claim. [[User:Kautilya3]] thinks, (even if it does) the source, i.e. Narendra Modi quoted by the cite (''without'' quote marks), is not acceptable.

Over this issue PakSol has done quite a bit of edit warring and name calling. He also keeps repeating [[WP:NOTTRUTH]], which looks slightly counter productive to me, as it warns - ''Most sources do not state their opinions as opinions, but as facts: "The hypno-toad is supreme" is more likely to be found than "our opinion is that the hypno-toad is supreme, but there are others who disagree with us."'' ([[WP:NOTTRUTH#"If it's written in a book, it must be true!"|"If it's written in a book, it must be true!"]]).

The article is now protected, but the editor PakSol has still not received a consensus or sanction or any other community intevention. That may be required if we consider his warring attitude, ignorance of arguments, and, if I may say so, extreme hard-headedness in pushing his POV, which looks a bit like coming from Pakistani Army POV to me. But, that is just my conjecture, yet to be established.

How real are the claims? Need some advise before I do anything about them. I do have a little CoI here (you see, I come from Bangladesh). <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.3em 0.3em 0.1em; class=texhtml"><font face="Kristen ITC" color="deeppink">[[User:Aditya Kabir|Aditya]]</font></span><sup>([[User talk:Aditya Kabir|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Aditya Kabir|contribs]])</sup> 18:09, 14 June 2015 (UTC)}}

'''Background:'''

Currently, part of the lead of the article states: 

{{tq|He is notable for the formal application of the caste system to the entire Hindu population of British India in the 1901 census, of which he was in charge. Risley was influential in the 20th-century revival of the hierarchical varna system as a structure for social order in India. He thought that the ancient varna concept could be applied to all of the modern castes.}} 

If you read the article, you will see that, part of it is the opinion of [[Lloyd Rudolph]]:

{{tq|According to political scientist Lloyd Rudolph, Risley believed that varna, however ancient, could be applied to all the modern castes found in India, and "[he] meant to identify and place several hundred million Indians within it.}}

However, the claim that {{tq|Risley was influential in the 20th-century revival of the hierarchical varna system as a structure for social order in India.}} has not been supported anywhere in the article. If you look that the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herbert_Hope_Risley&oldid=487710870 17 April 2012] revision of the article, just when it was made a [[WP:Good Article]], you will see that this part of the header used to have a citation, the same which is being used to support Rudolph's quote above. Back then the part of the header read:

{{tq|Risley was influential in the 20th century revival of the hierarchical varna system as a structure for social order in India. According to political scientist Lloyd Rudolph, Risley believed that varna, however ancient, could be applied to all the modern castes found in India, and "[he] meant to identify and place several hundred million Indians within it.}}

And I am quoting from it, at page [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3vnsnma5nW4C&lpg=PA306&vq=117&pg=PA118#v=onepage&q&f=false 118]. 

''{{tq|The scheme loosed a storm from below, as hundreds of jatis used the occasion to convert their aspirations to high status into a scientific or historical truth. By assuming an immanent reality and then giving it empirical expression, precisely at that moment when social movement and change were accelerating, Risley and others both aggravated rank consciousness and drew new attention to the reality-shaping possibilities of varna labels.}}'' 

Thus, it is an [[WP:Original research]] to claim a revival of the varna system. He actually aggravated an pre-existing caste system and hindered reforms by providing them with an illusion of scientific backing.

'''Proposals:'''

Since, this is a [[WP:Good Article]]. I thought I would build a consensus before it is edited. Frankly, I am surprised no one noticed these errors before me in such a good quality article. I propose: 

* {{tq|According to the political scientist Lloyd Rudolph, Risley believed that the ancient varna could be applied to all the modern castes found in India, and he intended to identify and place several hundred million Indians within it.}} This sentence or this sentence without the {{tq|According to political scientist Lloyd Rudolph}} part be used in the current header instead of the current sentence. 

* The claim {{tq|Risley was influential in the 20th-century revival of the hierarchical varna system as a structure for social order in India.}} be removed from the lead section or it should be changed to {{tq|Risley was responsible for aggravating the pre-existing caste system in India and hindering caste reforms.}} or something similar, because of the problems I pointed out.

I was told that this article is to go for [[WP:FAC]]. So, I would suggest that the article and its citations be closely examined for any more errors which may have escaped my eye. I hope we can work together and make this article of good quality again. -[[User:Kenfyre|<font color="#666FFF ">'''Ken'''</font><font color="#FF3C00">'''fyre'''</font>]] ([[User talk:Kenfyre|talk]]) 12:41, 15 June 2015 (UTC)}}

 An attempt to execute an RFC that offers users a chance to explain their reasoning opposed to the previous RFC which was poorly explained. I believe as it stands that the page no longer holds a neutral stance in the naming dispute, with many drive by editors expressing the same concern. 

::::Possible options for this page:
:::::a. Title:Derry - nothing changes
:::::b. Title:Derry with infobox official_name=Londonderry(only)
:::::c. Title:Derry~Londonderry  as used by City of Culture page - www.cityofculture2013.com (or an equivalent Derry/Londonderry)
:::::d. Title:Londonderry - use the official name as is common with this template at [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and [[Kingston upon Hull]]
:::::e. Title:Derry, Northern Ireland

::::And as before but the article lead is somewhat bias. The original compromise on the naming dispute had the lead beginning with Londonderry. If you look at [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Official_name as Article header, Lead: Official_name commonly known as Common_name.  [[Kingston upon Hull]] has Official_name as Article header, Lead:Common_name officially known as Official_name. It seems only here where Common_name is both the Article name and article lead. Someone has clearly gone out of their way to set hierarchy and go against the original compromise.

Please see the previous albeit longly worded section for my opinions; which boil down to "Surface RT" for article name and just "Surface" where it is clear form context in prose and extra words as necessary where it is not.

{{rfcquote|text=
Over the past few years there has been some changes regarding the naming structure of animal-based protein subjected articles (e.g. fish and types of fish, poultry and types of poultry etc.); unfortunately the we have drifted from a fairly standard structure (''Name of protein'' (food)) to a mishmash of article names ([[Fish as food]], [[Turkey meat]] etc.)

The question I am asking is this, what should the naming structure of these articles follow?

# ''Name of protein'' (food)
# ''Name of protein'' as food
# ''Name of protein'' meat

Now the first option seems the most logical to me and for many years was the format we used for these types of articles. Additionally this format follows the naming structure that WP uses in other fields (eg ''Name of film'' (film), ''Name of book'' (novel) etc.). The second structure seems unwieldy to me, and the the third has issues that conflict with societal perception of proteins within western culture (eg ''meat'' is traditionally the flesh consumed from mammalian sources, ''fowl'' or ''poultry'' from avian sources and ''fish'' from aquatic, non-mammalian sources.)

I would like to develop a formal naming structure for these topics so that we can move forward with a more uniform approach to the topic of animal-based proteins consumed for food.

Should [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diary_of_a_Japanese_Military_Brothel_Manager&oldid=668573055#Excerpts a list of contents] be restored or removed?
An editor [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diary_of_a_Japanese_Military_Brothel_Manager&diff=670591018&oldid=670590279 removed the list of contents] as original research. He insists the list of contents is a primary source because it is a collection of cites from the book itself. this mean a ridiculous claim '''An article about a book should not quote contents of the book.''' However [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books/Non-fiction article]] says "Contents/Chapters" section is permitted to include a list of contents unless it is "an exhaustive list of contents". 

Although the list of contents is not a primary source as defined in [[WP:OR]], for those who concern, I will add an article of Mainichi Shimbun as a secondary source. The Mainichi article lists most of the entries in my list of contents. This solves primary source concern. See [[#Cherry picking?]] above.<small>-Added at 7:03am, 15 July 2015‎ (UTC)</small>

The next claim is the list is cherry-picking. I explained the list is not cherry-picking by comparing the entries with The [[Mainichi Shimbun]]. See [[#Cherry picking?]] above. The real reason the editor removed the list is [[WP:JUSTDONTLIKEIT]]. He is a regular editor of [[Comfort women]]. His belief is an article about Comfort women should describe a terrible situation, anything which describes the opposite should not be included.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Comfort_women&diff=653755617&oldid=653755059][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Comfort_women&diff=651935330&oldid=651935097]

Other editors here suggested a prose style is preferred to the list. I agree with the suggestion and it is an issue for future improvement.

{{rfcquote|text=
Greetings to all editors of Wikipedia and specifically all editors of the Wikipedia page covering On Becoming Babywise,

I have known the authors of On Becoming Babywise since 1993. I worked for Multnomah Publishers from 1993 to 2001. I knew the book intimately during my 8 years with Multnomah, who was the exclusive publisher of On Becoming Babywise. For three of those years at Multnomah, I served as Assistant to the Publisher/President/Owner (Donald C. Jacobson). I have worked for Hawksflight & Associates, Inc. from 2001 to the present. Hawksflight & Associates, Inc. represent the world wide rights of On Becoming Babywise from 2001 - 2015. All this to say, I have thorough and complete knowledge On Becoming Babywise and the authors for 22 years now, steming back to my first year at Multnomah Publishers. I lay this out on my talk page so that there is no confusion who I am, why I am speaking about this book, and where my information comes from. I want to be fully in the open with my views, my information, my verification, and my motives.

A year ago I was being inundated with questions and comments from young parents and medical professionals about why the Wikipedia page on On Becoming Babywise is so one-sided and critical of such a proven best seller over time when the book has such incredible medical support around the country and the world. I signed up for an account on Wikipedia under my name at the time and made some edits to the site to bring both sides to this page. One of the edits I remember making was telling a little bit about our author, 26 year Pediatrician Dr. Robert Bucknam, M.D., and I referred to him as "popular" in the sentence. Immediately an editor said that our author is not "popular" and edited that (among many other things that were edited; all of which is record on Wikipedia and you can read for yourself). I thought that was exceptionally strange given the current Wikipedia page on this author's book, Dr. Robert Bucknam, M.D., refers to his critic, Dr. Bill Sears, as "popular Pediatrician." At that point I figured this Wikipedia page was being "guarded" by some anti-neutral or at least anti-On Becoming Babywise editors. So I stopped adding verifiable fact on the page.

Today, I want to open up a diologue with as many people as possible to gather input, because I continue to hear from so many parents, readers, and medical professionals who are appalled at the one-sided, negative nature of the current Wikipedia page on On Becoming Babywise. (especially given Wikipedia's own stated purpose to remain completely neutral in verifiable fact) So let me put a few questions out for discussion:

Does it seem fair or normal to have a book represented on Wikipedia with no biographical information on one of its two authors that wrote the work 22 years ago? Does it seem fair or normal to have such author biographical information removed or edited because some person/editor who espouses neutrality which is at the heart of Wikipedia's existence simply doesn't want to see it attached to the author's book page? In the current Wikipedia page on On Becoming Babywise, does it seem fair or normal to divide the page into 5 sections (one of them being "criticism") and yet all 5 sections on this book's page are laced with criticism? And does it seem fair or normal to you to see no hint of medical support listed on the entire Wikipedia page for a book which has such readily available medical support right in the book or listed on Amazon.com by R.N. C.L.E., Pediatricians, Professor of Pediatrics, Obstetricians, Pediatric Neurologists, Pediatric Cardiologist? (given the current Wikipedia page on On Becoming Babywise lists 5 medical critics, displays their resumes, refers to them as "popular", and even takes the time to quote them in their critiques)

I look forward to seeing a neutral dialogue about what is fair and what is normal for a Wikipedia page remaining or achieving true neutrality. I am new to this whole Wikipedia thing, so feel free to let me know if I am not signing in correctly, not signing my name to my articles where I need to, or not writing my comments in the right place here on Wikipedia's site. I have written to Wikipedia and believe I am following the counsel I received to a T while I dot my "i's." Thank you, in advance, for your collective thoughts and wisdom as we look for real neutrality for the medical support that has been in writing for more than 20 years for On Becoming Babywise and for the 26 year Pediatrician who wrote this work 22 years ago with co-author Gary Ezzo.

:You are assuming an equivalence between Bucknam and Sears, an equivalence that is not borne out in published assessments. Sears is popular, having published many best-selling books, edited many articles about pediatrics, and founded the heavily trafficked website Ask Dr Sears. Bucknam has none of that going for him. People who write about Sears (and there are lots of them) discuss his expertise in the field. The few people who write about Bucknam usually observe that he had been a pediatrician for less than a year when he was asked to sign his name as co-author to the secular version of the book written by the Ezzos.[http://www.salon.com/1998/08/06/cov_06feature/][http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/july8/12.20.html] So there's no need to jam into this article more extensive biographical information about Bucknam, which in any case would violate [[WP:COATRACK]]. Bucknam is of borderline notability, having had his authorship of the Babywise series questioned. If someone can prove he meets Wikipedia's notability requirements as seen at [[WP:GNG]], then a biography can be written about him. Otherwise, he's a minor element at this book article.

== How should Fury's nationality be described? '''

This is still not resolved and there is an edit war going on regarding his nationality. I propose he be listed as Irish / British, with Irish being the predominant nationality. The reasons? He fights with Irish colours (green shorts and shamrock) and this article clearly states that he considers himself Irish: http://www.irishcentral.com/sports/tyson-fury-en-route-to-msg-says-i-fight-for-ireland-i-am-no-plastic-paddy-202301431-237579631.html

He vacated all British titles to compete for the Irish titles and abandoned all his connections with representing Britain to represent Ireland (and you must hold an Irish passport to do so), as that is his chosen nationality. [[User:LeinsterLad]] 

:Ok... Fury was born and raised in Manchester to Mancunian parents. That makes him British primarily. Surely he can't be listed as Irish because his great, great, great grandfather was from Ireland? Hell, if he was Irish, wouldn't he be fighting in Ireland all the time? He's only fought once in Ireland. If anything he should be listed as British from Irish descent. Boxrec and The Ring both have him listed as British also. [[Special:Contributions/85.210.140.255|85.210.140.255]] ([[User talk:85.210.140.255|talk]]) 19:34, 22 June 2015 (UTC)}}

If a FAC is deemed to be "stale" rather than just being archived without warning, notice should be given that archiving is being considered so that the nominator can take the necessary action to ensure that outstanding issues are addressed, or the opinions of commentor are finalised, or fresh eyes are cast over the FAC before it gets archived.

There is nothing inherently wrong with a FAC getting archived if it really is stale, but for one to be closed merely because the nominator is waiting for a commentor to respond without even being given notice that the FAC was in danger of being closed is totally wrong.

In the section on “Schism and Excommunication, 1990-1997” the text reads “ the cause of the split was the friction between hierarchical tradition and democratic modernity”. Could anyone specify of what democratic elements this is an indication of? Many Christian Protestant congregations are organised in a more Democratic fashion than SGI is. At this point we need more than just dubious sources speaking of a so called “democratic modernity” but of sources proving a “democratic modernity” in practise. 
The source cited only states a REVIEW on a book and does not cite the book nor a scholar per se on the subject. Ongoing talk page discussions did not help to define how democracy is defined within SG/SGI. 
Even though RfC’s on SG/SGI do not really catch a lot of attention these days I will try my luck.--[[User:Catflap08|Catflap08]] ([[User talk:Catflap08|talk]]) 17:04, 23 June 2015 (UTC)}}

Specifically, I request for commentators to see the last edit of mine to the article for a more up-to-date version of what is proposed for context, as what is in the ''Proposed changes'' on this talk page, was truncated during the dispute.

I propose that we either change the policy or clarify the wording regarding how users contest a speedy deletion. The current policy as it is worded only forbids the article creator from removing a speedy deletion tag, any other user can remove the speedy deletion tag in order to contest the speedy deletion. However, many times the article creator will simply log out and remove the tag or create a new account to remove the tag in an attempt to bypass this guideline. Many new page/recent changes patrollers already revert these "unexplained" removals of speedy deletion tags as disruptive. I would like to see the policy changed to state that any editor removing a speedy deletion tag, must also provide a reasoning for the removal in the edit summary (or talk page), otherwise it is considered disruptive and may be reverted. As I stated, many editors already practice this anyways as a matter of common sense. It's silly to allow article creators to simply contest a speedy deletion by logging out, and they clearly are not acting in good faith. It would waste time to have to take many of these articles to AfD. Experienced editors who contest speedy deletions normally leave an explanatory edit summary anyhow, so I don't see this change as being controversial, or that it adds undue weight to the deletion process.

There have been a number of disputes, including one recent one at [[WP:AN/I]] that have resulted from different interpretations of what '''Contentious''' means. This is particularly important as it applies to the [[WP:BLPREMOVE]] section, because that section authorizes edit warring and [[WP:INVOLVED]] admin actions where the material is contentious, when it would otherwise be prohibited. Because the definition is not clear, we end up with situations where some people believe an editor or admin has committed a serious policy violation, while others believe they followed policy. This RFC seeks to clarify the meaning going forward. While references to past conduct may be necessary for the discussion, the discussion is about how to resolve the issue moving forward, not the past conduct.

There is an argument going on created by a user who believe that many planetary images are speculative and inappropriate for use on an encyclopedia. I do not want to argue with him so I'm seeking everyone's opinion and I want to do it in a democratic way. Do you want to '''keep''' or '''remove''' images like the one below (which are only a sample) from article pages and lists. Currently only selective pages are having the images striped and I belive either all the speculative images go or none. All the non speculative images can stay. The current definition of a speculative image from this persion as I understand it are "Images that contain unconfirmed details, patterns, or features of a planet or substellar object (Brown Dwarf)."

Sample of considered speculative (that needs to go if remove is chosen):

[[File:Kepler-69c-_Super-Venus.jpg|250px]] [[File:Kepler22b-artwork.jpg|250px]] [[File:Gliese_667_Cc_sunset.jpg|250px]]

Sample of considered non Speculative (those that can stay if remove is chosen):

[[File:Exoplanet_Comparison_Kepler-186_f.png|250px]] [[File:KIC_12557548.jpg|250px]]

So what do you think should artists impressions go or not? Note the images are not a complete list there are more.

{{rfcquote|text=
There may be an irony in that (<small>add:</small> the titles of) Wikipedia disambiguation (navigation) pages are often not disambiguated.  This also leads to an issue with regard to WP:CRITERIA Consistency which presents the ideal that "{{tq|The title is consistent with the pattern of similar articles' titles.}}".  In actuality in which many of our  navigation purposed disambiguation pages are titled "Foobar (disambiguation)" while other pages (all of which - according to [[WP:Disambiguation#Page style]] presents "{{tq|a list (or multiple lists, for multiple senses of the term in question)}}") simply presents a title in the typically singular form "Foobar".  

If I visit an article named "Foo" (a title presented in singular form) I may naturally assume that the article entitled "Foo" will be concerning ''a'' subject on ''a'' topic named "Foo" or "foo".  I will not necessarily expect to find a list of Foos/foos.  For some time not I have regarded that less ambiguous titles might go along the lines of "Foo (disambiguation)" or "List of F/foos" in a pluralised [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllPages&from=List+of&to=&namespace=0&hideredirects=1 "List of .."] type format.  

Without a disambiguation of disambiguation lists these lists fundamentally fail WP:AT which presents the ideal that "{{tq|The title indicates what the article is about and distinguishes it from other articles.}}"   A title such as [[John Smith]] presents a single name as of a single entity (person or organisation) who/that, in this case, would be called "John Smith".  However, what we find in the article is a very long [[List of John Smiths]] and yet, failing to follow the format provided by the many "Foo (disambigution)" articles, the navigation page is not disambiguated from anything from amongst its extensive content. 

I also think that the fact that Wikipedia editors have developed such a vast body of collaborative work to the point that it requires navigation deserves, if anything, celebration and I think that editors can be rightly proud that we have developed multiple articles that may all be referenced by use of identical terminologies.  To erroneously describe a "{{tq|List of foos}}" as "{{tq|Foo}}" helps neither the reader or Wikipedia.  

On the topic of helping the reader I also think that it would be to the benefit of readers if we moved towards the use of "navigation" based terminologies and this is an issue that was previously raised in the thread [[Wikipedia talk:Disambiguation/Archive 43#Disambiguation pages are navigation pages]].  In web searches:
*[https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=article%20navigation%20-wikipedia article navigation -wikipedia] got "About 594,000,000 results" while
*[https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=article+disambiguation+-Wikipedia article disambiguation -Wikipedia] got "About 560,000 results" 
That's a ratio of 1060:1 in relation to the raw data results.  

My interpretation is that "disambiguation" is a necessary editor concern in relation to the differentiation and frequent dissection of terminologies so as to fit mainly technical article address requirements.  Reader concern however is, arguably, navigation of content and, in effect and even though it has its advantages, a title such as "Foo (disambiguation)" fails [[WP:UCRN]].  The main thing that this format of title achieves is a non commonname disambiguation from "Foo"

My suggestion is that we develop a Wikipedia preference for disambiguation lists for a topic such as "Foo" be placed at titles which might be presented in a format such as:
*[[Foo (navigation)]]
*[[Foo (navigation guide)]]
*[[Foo (navigation page)]]
*[[Foo (article navigation)]]
*[[Foo (article navigation guide)]]
*[[Foo (article navigation page)]] or
*{{tq|Foo (disambiguation)}}
If a decision was taken to adopt something like a "{{tq|.. (.. navigation ..)}}" disambiguation option then, if I were to be given the tools, I would be happy to action any currently required changes. I believe there are only ~2000 "... (disambiguation)" articles so this type of change would not take long.  

However, beyond a potential encouragement for editors to think more in accordance to reader navigational needs, the main issue presented here is the WP:Precise titling of disambiguation lists according to the ideal that "{{tq|titles should be precise enough to unambiguously define the topical scope of the article}}".  This is something that our current titles fail to do.

My edit has been reverted by three editors, without anybody even bothering to address my reasons, just implementing [[WP:WIKILAWYERING]] and reverting me because of [[WP:1RR]]. Since I am an experienced editor, I think that they are wrong.

My reasons were and are that:
# Page numbers shouldn't be part of the quotation. Citation templates have many parameters, and the parameter for page numbers is "page" and the parameter for text is "quote". These shouldn't be mixed. 
# This so-called "quote" is actually a collage of a few very short rfagments from different pages, and the one quote from page 160 which I left. The fragments do not shed any light on the statement they come to source, and even if they do, the quote from page 160 is enough in itself and the fragments superfluous.
# To collect fragments of sentences from different pages and make them into one statement is what is called "taking things out of context". With that method anything can be proven, and an encyclopedia can not engage in synthesizing fragments from different pages of a book into one "source". This is a big faux pas in a serious work like Wikipedia.

For the above reasons I ask the community to express its opinion to the editors who undid my edit, that the present text is not fit for an encyclopedia like Wikipedia, and to restore my edit. [[User:Debresser|Debresser]] ([[User talk:Debresser|talk]]) 20:48, 22 July 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Currently, the notability guideline is disorganized, confusing, and with too much room for interpretation. So I have created a rewritten draft (at least half of it) at [[User:Esquivalience/Notability rewrite]]. The improvements include:

* Overhaul of [[WP:GNG]]: by defining significant coverage and reliable source with greater detail in the context of notability. However, a controversial addition that needs more discussion is the consideration of juxtaposition and placement when assessing whether a source significantly covers the topic and how strongly it does.
* Modified the lead so it is clearer: currently, it is a mess of a summary.
* Stressed the importance of [[WP:BEFORE]] and searching for sources - even our best admins forget this from time-to-time.
* Removed <s>[[WP:FAILN]]</s>[[WP:WHYN]], the only purpose of this is to describe why the "second prong" (i.e. reliable source coverage) exists. This can be easily discussed in the lead.
* General stylistic and prose improvements, the style and prose at the current guideline is atrocious.

Any thoughts on this? '''[[User:Esquivalience|<span style="color: #3BB9FF; font-style: italic; font-family: Lato, sans-serif'">Esquivalience</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Esquivalience|<span style="color:#00B88A;">t</span>]]</sup>''' 17:32, 26 June 2015 (UTC)}}

At [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Military_history/Content_guide#War]] we are encouraged to include the "trigger, if notable".

The trigger is usually the most hotly disputed topic in all articles on wars, particularly modern wars, as both sides in the actual conflict will usually have blamed each other for "starting it". The WP:MILHIST content guide could help reduce unnecessary disputes by giving guidance on how to produce a neutral description of the trigger. 

I propose amending the word "trigger" to "stated [[casus belli]]", and then explaining that if the stated casus belli is disputed (i.e. WP:RS include claims that it was just a [[pretext]]), best practice would include either a footnote or a section in the main body of the article setting out the different perspectives on the stated casus belli held by WP:RS. Best practice would also avoid stating in wikipedia's neutral voice that the conflict was started by one side or the other, unless WP:RS do not reference such disputes.

Originally when I made the decision to split the season's of ''Bad Girls Club'' into their own individual articles back in 2010, I introduced the 'Duration of Cast' subsection. I am beginning to regret ever doing so as it continues to be the prime suspect of vandalism by IPs and [[WP:VOA]]s on ''Bad Girls Club'' articles. I decided to bring this topic to the forefront of [[WP:RfC]] and users who are regular combats of the constant vandalism found on ''Bad Girls Club'' related articles (and others who stumble upon them), to decide whether or not the "Duration of Cast" is encyclopedic and appropriate for this subgenre of television. The purpose of the "Duration of Cast" is to showcase the cast members appearance on their respective seasons by using various color codes for various denotations (e.g., removed, replacement joins). This table, though fails [[WP:ACCESS]], was based on another subgenre of television such as game shows, whereas ''Bad Girls Club'' is a reality television show not based on competitive challenges. Because of this, the "Duration of Cast" is not appropriate for this subgenre of television, as producers do not plan to have a cast member removed from the show (even if it's always an occurrence) as it is not a game show like ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (U.S. TV series)|Big Brother]]'' where producers plan to have an eviction or an ejection from the show as it progresses into the season. In ''Bad Girls Club'', there is no eviction episode or an episode where producers plan to have a cast member voted out; if this was the case the "Duration of Cast" would be appropriate for ''Bad Girls Club''. Currently, the "Duration of Cast" is seen as a battleground for IPs and VOAs who constantly rearrange or introduce color codes and start a [[WP:COLORWAR|color war]] based on [[WP:FAN|fan cruft]] and are not based on [[WP:IRS|reliable sources]]; rarely do you see an IP or VOA introduced a non-social media source to the article(s). Since its introduction the table used in ''Bad Girls Club'' have been duplicated into other non-game shows such as ''[[The Real Housewives]]''. I would like to get [[WP:Consensus|consensus]] on this issue, should ''Bad Girls Club'' articles (with the exception of ''[[Bad Girls All-Star Battle]]'') be stripped from the usage of the "Duration of Cast" based on the information provided above or should we continue to encourage the table and if so, which methods should be performed to tackle the current issues it faces? (vandalism, WP:ACCESS, color wars, and encyclopedic).

{{rfcquote|text=
Same-sex marriage is considered a standard neutral term over alternatives such as 'equal marriage', 'gay marriage', 'homosexual marriage', or other words to that effect. Exceptions may be appropriate for some articles solely where sufficient reliable sources use a different terminology to address the subject, the matter has been discussed on the article's talk page and a consensus has been reached. For example, an article on equal rights may discuss 'marriage equality' in the context of a political rights campaign that commonly uses those words in reliable sources, and the editors have come to an agreement that it is suitable to use that term. Rapid mass changes should be avoided, as an article's sources must be checked that they support the chosen terminology. Bringing articles in line with this proposal is permitted immediately after the discussion has ended.

Please see discussion above for a background of why this proposal is needed and options already discussed. --[[User:Fæ|Fæ]] ([[User talk:Fæ|talk]]) 15:07, 22 July 2015 (UTC)}}

Until July 27, the article had a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Race_and_genetics&type=revision&diff=673621945&oldid=673621318 paragraph] describing the shortcomings of [[Fixation_index|FST]] as a measure of genetic distance, but the paragraph was removed recently. The paragraph's sources were:

*Long, J.C. & Kittles, R.A. (2009). "Human genetic diversity and the nonexistence of biological races". Human Biology 81 (5/6): 777–798.
*Mountain, J.L. & Risch, N (2004). "Assessing genetic contributions to phenotypic differences among 'racial' and 'ethnic' groups". Nature Genetics 36 (11 Suppl): S48 – S53.
*Pearse, D. E., & Crandall, K. A. "Beyond FST: analysis of population genetic data for conservation". Conservation Genetics 5(5): 585–602.

The editors removing this material haven't replied to my inquiries about why it's being removed, so it hasn't been possible to resolve the disagreement on the talk page. I'm not sure what the correct protocol is in this situation, but apparently the pre-existing version of the article cannot be restored unless there's a consensus for it. Should the shortcomings of FST (as applied to human populations) be covered in this article?

Rather than go the route of {{tl|db-move}} repeatedly, I would like to bring this matter up for discussion to achieve consensus on how this article should be named.  

To begin, new user {{user|Nagarukhra}} has been moving pages without discussion and creating unnecessary disambiguation pages, arguably disruptively.  In one instance, they moved the article for [[Karimpur]] to [[Karimpur, Nadia]], then moved the same article again to [[Talk:Karimpur,Nadia]], effectively flipping the article over to a talk page.  Please see complete page move history at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/Nagarukhra 

I have consulted [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Indian_cities#Basic_India_conventions]], [[Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(geographic_names)]], and [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Disambiguation_pages#Places]].  As this city name is unique and does not conflict with any other, it is therefore an unnecessary disambiguation.  I believe that returning this article back to its original title, simply '''[[Nagarukhra]]''', should be non-controversial but as it has been moved, moved back, and then moved again, I am now seeking community input.

I propose that, due to the prominence of navboxes and sidebars, criterion numero 5 in {{Section link|Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates|Navigation templates}} be reinforced with:

#<li value="5"> The subject of a navigation template should be of a defining nature to the articles that the navigation template is placed in.

''' Rationale '''

* Navigation templates, and navboxes in particular, are often placed in articles they're peripherally relevant. One recent example would be {{tl|Black Lives Matter}}, the subject of which, [[Black Lives Matter]], is only mentioned in passing in all of the shooting articles. Navigation templates are visually distinctive and thus demand the attention of the reader; the reader may be left with the impression that the subject is of import to the article. This is tantamount to a [[WP:UNDUE]] violation.
* Non-defining navboxes [[WP:TCREEP|clutter]] the footer of articles. Take, for instance, the international organisation country membership navboxes, which are themselves contained in navbox containers, in [[China]] or [[Japan]].

This RfC concerns the Critical response section of the article. See the [[Talk:Mad Max: Fury Road#Semi-protected edit request on 13 May 2015|Semi-protected edit request on 13 May 2015]] discussion above on the talk page for further detail. One view is that the material "absolutely violates [[WP:FRINGE]] and [[WP:UNDUE]] and should be removed immediately. This kind of criticism is rooted in misogyny and sexism and represents the opinion of a very, very small group of men who object to the fact that a woman is the lead in an action movie. [...] There's no need to address the opinions of a few misogynists marketing themselves as 'men's rights activists' who criticized the movie." The other view is that "Whether we call them [[sexist]], misguided fanboys, or whatever else, sources are noting this with regard to a cultural divide; and, again, it is something this article should cover. [...] We should be noting the feminist praise, why some men are against the film, and that some sources have called them sexist and/or misogynistic. But again, not all of the male criticism has come from [[men's rights]] activists. Some of these articles [..] simply note men being threatened by or otherwise upset by Furiosa (meaning without tying them to a men's rights mindset)."

Some sources showing the feminist, sexist, misogynistic and/or anti-feminist commentary are the following:
{{collapse top|title=Click on this to see the sources.}}
1. This "[http://www.hitfix.com/harpy/7-ways-mad-max-fury-road-sublimely-subverts-movie-sexism#2bypWlLdTkSzZPFE.99 7 ways ‘Mad Max: Fury Road’ sublimely subverts movie sexism]" [[HitFix]] source, for example, states, "There’s nothing secret about it. ''Fury Road'' is two hours of high octane action that is also a giant middle finger to every sexist action movie trope that has come before it. From the moment Imperator Furiosa takes a hard left into the desert to the second the end credits rolls, Miller is not interested in the status quo whether it comes to stunts, storytelling, or stereotypes."
 
2. This "[http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/05/22/why-imperator-furiosa-not-mad-max-is-the-hero-for-our-age/ Why Imperator Furiosa, not Mad Max, is the hero for our age]" [[Reuters]] source, for example, states, "The female savior-hero took a while to get to cultural center stage, but in the form of Furiosa, her presence is so powerful — even with only one arm — that many male action-film fans are enraged that she has stolen the show. The fan backlash against ''Fury Road'', despite the critical acclaim, may reflect another societal shift in which many men feel that their social and economic power has been threatened. I hadn’t planned on seeing ''Mad Max: Fury Road'', but once I heard that some men had declared the movie a feminist conspiracy of mass-emasculating proportions, I couldn’t resist. And now I’m here to tell you that I can see why some men – sexist men, anyway – would be afraid of it. They should be."

3. This [http://www.etonline.com/movies/165264_tom_hardy_perfectly_shuts_down_a_reporter_who_asks_a_sexist_question_about_mad_max_fury_road/ Tom Hardy Perfectly Shuts Down a Reporter Who Asks a Sexist Question About 'Mad Max: Fury Road']" [[ETonline.com]] source, for example, states, "Naturally, the conversation turned to the fact that the movie has women in it who are allowed to do more than be saved and have cleavage (as it seems to do in every interview about ''Fury Road''). The reporter starts, 'I’ll preface my remarks by saying that I have five sisters, a wife, a daughter, and a mother, so I know what it’s like to be outgunned by estrogen.' The reporter, Peter Howell of the ''Toronto Star'', clarified to Buzzfeed News that his question 'was intended as the opposite of sexism.' Instead, Howell claims, 'I was congratulating him for his willingness to share the screen with so many strong women in a franchise and genre more inclined to celebrate the male over the female.' He later admits, 'I don’t think I worded my question very well.' Anyway, ''Mad Max: Fury Road'' is feminist. It’s also crazy good. So get over it. Move on. Stop asking about why it’s feminist, and just start enjoying the fact that it is. Like with your new favorite meme: Feminist Mad Max."

Men’s rights activists lost their shit over the film, with one representatively vewy angwy guy calling it 'feminist propaganda' and 'a piece of American culture ruined and rewritten.'"

5. This "[http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2015/05/no-mad-max-fury-road-not-feminist-masterpiece-s-ok No, Mad Max: Fury Road is not a feminist masterpiece (but that’s OK)]" ''[[New Statesman]]'' source, for example, states, "Neither ''Pretty Woman'' nor ''Showgirls'' are hailed as 'feminist masterpieces', but since its opening weekend ''Mad Max: Fury Road'' has been celebrated as exactly that. Often, I’ve observed, by men – feminist allies gleefully celebrating the introduction or deconstruction of gender politics to a stereotypically male genre. A feminist masterpiece would be Furiosa’s story. It’s not. It’s Max’s story. He’s haunted by the women and girls he failed to save, redeemed by the women and girls he succeeds in saving." 

6. This [http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/05/26/mad-max-fury-road-and-the-political-limits-of-action-movies/ ‘Mad Max: Fury Road’ and the political limits of action movies]" ''[[The Washington Post]]'' source, for example, states, "It’s no longer a surprise when an action blockbuster spurs a fierce political debate, but even by that measure, the reception for George Miller’s latest installment in the 'Mad Max' franchise, ''Mad Max: Fury Road'', has stirred unusual passions. Before the movie even arrived in theaters, some men’s rights activists declared themselves squarely against it, on the grounds that Max was being sidelined in favor of a woman and that men were being treated like the enemy. Writers from a range of outlets and perspectives embraced precisely those parts of the film that the men’s rights critique disdained. And a third crew of critics sallied forth to claim the movie for a wider-ranging humanism. It’s simultaneously true that they’re all correct about 'Mad Max,' but also that none of them are, not entirely."

7. This "[http://www.glamour.com/inspired/blogs/the-conversation/2015/05/mad-max-feminism Believe the Hype: The New Mad Max Movie Is an Awesome Feminist Thrill Ride]" ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' source, for example, states, "Miller consulted with feminist and ''Vagina Monologues'' creator Eve Ensler when making the film, inviting her on set to talk about violence against women. 'It was really a wonderful experience for me,' Ensler told NPR. 'And a real honor to sit with those wonderful actors and talk about issues like how do you feel carrying a baby of someone who's raped you? What does it mean to be held captive by a warlord who is using you as a breeder and raping you constantly?' Perhaps it's not so surprising then that Mad Max, played by Tom Hardy, becomes almost an afterthought in the movie—more of a helpful sidekick than a starring action hero. That role is reserved for Furiosa, who not only has a higher skill level—at one point in the film, Max surrenders his gun to her when he can't make the shot; she nails it in one try—but also a higher mission." 

8. This "[http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/20/8620229/mad-max-fury-road-anti-feminist-mens-rights-boycott Misogynists are totally right to be mad at Mad Max]" ''[[The Verge]]'' source, for example, states, "Last week, the best publicity ''Mad Max: Fury Road'' could possibly have gotten — besides the nigh-universal critical praise, of course — was an angry anti-feminist blog post calling for men to avoid 'the Trojan Horse feminists and Hollywood leftists will use to (vainly) insist on the trope women are equal to men in all things.' The downright mad, or perhaps even furious article was picked up on ''The Mary Sue'', CNN, ''The Hollywood Reporter'', ''The A/V Club'', and other sites, frequently under the headline that men's rights advocates were boycotting ''Mad Max''. This wasn't quite accurate. The primary source was one blog post, posted on the anti-feminist site Return of Kings and discovered by inimitable 'manosphere' reporter David Futrelle. Return of Kings didn't organize much of a formal boycott, and it says it rejects the 'men's rights' movement proper, although to outsiders, that's a pretty fine distinction. (As far as I understand, a major difference is that they hate women but want to have sex with them instead of hating women and pretending to not want to have sex with them. It's complicated.) Outside the manosphere, though, we're having the same basic debate about ''Game of Thrones'', whose frequent rape scenes spurred ''The Mary Sue'' to start a real boycott of the show. We're talking about what actually reflects human experience in fiction, and what's just an overused trope, an idea we've seen so many times that we confuse it for reality. And whether you're there for the narrative themes or the car chases, ''Fury Road'' is a film that actively deflates one of misogynists' most treasured fantasies."

{{rfcquote|text=
In football club season articles such as the [[2015–16 Manchester City F.C. season|Machester City 2015-16]] season, flags are being used to denote a country in which a club usually plays there football. This is being done in both friendlies and in European competition sections. In friendly matches clubs are not representing a country so the flags are not indicating nationality or being representative. They are only being used to indicate where a team usually play, in most cases in friendlies these matches aren't even being played in that country. It is my believe this is against the spirit of the mos flag policy. The flag is being used instead of text where text would be sufficient. It is different for the European competitions because the club would be representing that nationality as part of a limited number of places. Flags are widely being misused in sports articles not just football and it's about time sports complied more fully.

{{rfcquote|text=
I'd like to finally start an RfC that is a follow on from [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(idea_lab)#More_stringent_requirements_on_admin_activity|this Idea Lab]] discussion, regarding increasing the requirements for activity for a user to retain their administrator rights. In 2011 [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/suspend_sysop_rights_of_inactive_admins|a discussion]] came to the conclusion that admins who had not performed any edits or admin actions over a period of one year should be desysopped. These editors can request their tools back without a new RfA during a period up to 3 years of inactivity, after which a fresh RfA is required. The current wording of [[WP:INACTIVITY]] states that "Admin accounts which have made no edits or administrative actions for at least 12 months may be desysopped."

There has recently been concern regarding those administrators who make very few administrator actions per year - some editors feel that a higher level of activity is expected of administrators to ensure that they are up to date on Wikipedia policies and practices. Others are concerned about the lack of accountability of those administrators who only make one or two actions per year and are otherwise inactive. Another issue is the tracking of the number of administrators on Wikipedia; varying activity means that the number of admins does not accurately represent the number of admins actively carrying out administrative tasks.

Some statistics will be useful in addressing this issue, which I primarily got from [https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools/adminstats/?project=en.wikipedia.org&begin=2014-06-06&end=2015-06-06 this tool query] (that link can take a minute or two to open/run, be patient!). There are, as of the time of this posting, 1347 users with administrator rights on the English Wikipedia. Of those, 918 (68%) have made at least one loggable admin action over the past year. 609 have made more than 10 admin actions, with the other 738 (55%) contributing a total of 1092 actions over the past year (about 0.1% of all 1,101,983 actions). Put another way, out of interest, 45% of administrators carry out 99.9% of all administrator actions.

My proposal is this: Changing the text of [[WP:INACTIVITY]] from "Admin accounts which have made no edits or administrative actions for at least 12 months may be desysopped." to "Admin accounts which have made no more than 10 administrative actions for at least 12 months may be desysopped."

In addition to the "[[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats#Inactive bureaucrat accounts|Inactive bureaucrat accounts]]" requirements, if a bureaucrat does not participate in bureaucrat activity<ref>Bureaucrat activity is widely construed and includes acting or commenting as a bureaucrat at any venue including WP:BN/RFA/RFB/RFBAG/BRFA and responding to requests in their capacity as a [[meta:global renamer|global renamer]] or subscriber to the bureaucrats' mailing list or signalling that they remain actively engaged and available for bureacrat tasks.</ref> for over five years, their bureaucrat permissions may be removed.

'''Introduction'''

On Wikipedia, [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] is the primary means of achieving change of the extant policies and guidelines. This has been a defining principle of this community for many a year, and our consensus-building model has gained us much interest from scholars who want to examine it, and normal people who are excited at the fact that even they can make great changes to one of the most visited and viewed websites on the planet. "The thing about Wikipedia," it is said, {{plain link|http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2007/10/14/the-thing-about-wikipedia-is-that-it-only-works-in-practice-in-theory-it-can-never-work/|"is that it only works in practice. In theory, it can never work."}} Indeed. When consensus works, it's beautiful. But it does have a darker side.

Consensus can take a long time to develop. Now, the amount of time consensus takes is not, in my opinion, an issue in and of itself. I do believe that time allows for people to calm down, and creative solutions to be brought up. However, with consensus, there is no guarantee that any resolution at all will be affected, or than enough input is given to ensure that the resolution is lasting and has the support of a wide base of users. Combine that with the fact that if a person refuses to compromise, or take the view of other people into account consensus becomes unattainable, which becomes more and more likely the more people join into a discussion, and seeking consensus in such instances has as much effect as {{plain link|http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/bang+head+against+a+brick+wall|"banging your head against a brick wall"}}. But on this site, we have no other choice. If a discussion comes to no consensus, editors have no place to go. Therefore, the current system ''forces'' Wikipedia's community to bang their heads against a wall, running in infinite loops to solve a problem, where, more than like, the same group of editors that participated in previous discussions will bring their same viewpoints, and nothing ever gets done. Meanwhile, the problem that consensus was suppose to solve in the first place remains. That doesn't help this community or our readers; in fact, {{plain link|http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/alberteins133991.html|it's insanity}}.

What I am proposing is a recourse for when consensus has failed to administer a solution to a problem, and the problem persists. What I am proposing is a Regulation Committee, an elected group of sensible editors accountable to the community, who would have the ability to issue binding policy and guideline changes in an effort to solve problems brought before it by community members, and would only come into play when consensus has failed. The usefulness of such a committee will likely be evident to anyone who has ever been involved in a contentious discussion on this site. Editors fight bitterly from what ever point of view they have, and sometimes this prevent consensus from being built properly. We have already understood the sensibility of an [[WP:INVOLVED|uninvolved editor]] making decisions, and the potential destructiveness of involved and intransigent editors and administrators making binding or serious decisions that affect many people.

Now, I do not question that consensus works in the vast majority of cases, and most editors are happy with it. But, when consensus doesn't work, it tends to not work spectacularly. An example, if you will: in August 2012, the community agreed that, "[[Wikipedia:Requests for Comment/Community de-adminship proof of concept|The current methods for removal of administrator rights are not sufficient and an additional community-driven method should be implemented.]]" Three goddamn years later, what have we accomplished? Stone wall, after stone wall, after stone wall. Consensus can be [[heaven]] (to paint a rosy picture) but it can also be an [[echo chamber]], a [[peanut gallery]], and a [[wiktionary:Battleground|battleground]]. Meanwhile, the problem that consensus was supposed to solve persists. And the <s>bitterly ironic</s> funny thing is, we have no other avenue to go to but consensus, but we can't be sure that consensus will bring about anything substantive other than more bloviating and time-wasting. This is not something we should aspire to. It is in no one's interest if this community has been consensus'd to absolute inaction and stagnation. Also, "no consensus" closures happen fairly often, but the only option is more consensus. When the same crop of editors bring the same opinions to another discussion, no consensus is reached. Cf. "banging your head against a brick wall." This is obviously frustrating, and it would benefit us to have an alternative to go to when consensus has failed. I know a Regulation Committee would sound like bureaucracy, but sometimes bureaucracy, formality and [[Wikipedia:Process is important|due process]] are necessary evils to provide for the furtherance, betterment and maintenance of a community.

'''How it might work'''

* Mission statement: "When consensus fails to bring a solution to a problem that Wikipedia's community experiences in a reasonable time frame, the Regulation Committee seeks to issue binding changes to Wikipedia's policies, guidelines and processes."
* Possible process: Once all reasonable means of seeking consensus have been exhausted, the problem is brought before members of the Regulation Committee. Regulators then cast their opinions on whether there is a real problem that consensus can't or has not been able to fix. If there isn't, or a resolution has already been reached, the case is declined. If they decide that there is one, they take the problem on. Afterwards, there is a workshop phase that should normally last thirty days, but that time frame can be extended or abridged if a majority of the committee (50% and one) agree to do that. In the workshop, community members cast a cornucopia of proposals on how said problem could be fixed, and other community members discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each proposal. When the workshop phase is closed, regulators deliberate privately on the merits of each proposal and vote for the ones they think have the most merit, and the most probability to bring a long-lasting solution.{{#tag:ref|The difference between this and consensus is that, while consensus grants no assurances, we know that a binding decision will come out of this. Beyond that, an assurance of a solution may invite editors who have been frustrated by the problem and lack of solution and chosen to forego the headache that stagnation and inaction brings, to re-engage and seek a fix, thus widening the pool of ideas and discussion.|group=Note}}
* I cannot think of a reason for a Regulation Committee to take on a case without prior failure of consensus to solve a problem, therefore, the Regulation Committee should normally '''only act''' when consensus has not brought about a solution, but the problem persists. However, elected regulators should use their common sense and discretion when deciding whether or not to take on an issue.
* After regulators agree to hear an issue, Regulation Committee members (or clerks) will have a certain amount of time (7–10 days) to summarize previous discussions, proposals and ideas, and present them in a structured, orderly way so the community can view it and make an informed decision. This would ideally happen before the workshop phase.
* The workshop phase is vital to this proposal. Therefore, regulators should not have the power, even if a majority wills to do so the eliminate the workshop phase, where community members can discuss possible resolutions to an issue. Neither should the workshop phase to abridged to less than 15 days.
* The Regulation Committee would not hear issues relating to user conduct. Such cases would be referred to the [[WP:ARBCOM|Arbitration Committee]].
* '''Added''': The Regulation Committee would only act if consensus has been sought out in two distinct locations (which isn't a very hard bar to reach seeing that there is practically a cornucopia of locations to seek out consensus), and in both cases, has failed to reach a solution. This is intended to diversify the opinions that are received, and perhaps keep issues in the community's court as much as possible.
