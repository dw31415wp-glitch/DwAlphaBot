{{rfcquote|text=
The following paragraph from the Muhammad article is in dispute. "Traditional sources dictate Aisha was six or seven years old when betrothed to Muhammad,[150][227][228] with the marriage not being consummated until she had reached puberty at the age of nine or ten years old.[150][227][229][230][231][232][233] She was therefore a virgin at marriage.[227] A small number of modern Muslim writers have estimated her age between 12 and 24.[234][235][236]"

The dispute ranges on whether the statement about Aisha reaching puberty is [[WP:UNDUE]], whether the paragraph itself is [[WP:UNDUE]], or if a footnote should be included to say that young marriages during the 600s was normal.(UTC)

The discussion and additional sources can be found on this talk page in sections: 1) [[Talk:Muhammad#Aisha_.22reaching_age_of_puberty.22|Aisha "reaching age of puberty"]], 2) [[Talk:Muhammad#Removal_of_paragraph|Removal of paragraph]], 3) [[Talk:Muhammad#The_thing_that_should_actually_be_disputed|The thing that should actually be disputed]], 4) [[Talk:Muhammad#Proposal_for_changes_on_Aisha.27s_mariage|Proposal for changes on Aisha's mariage]].

{{rfcquote|text=
A recent large number of edits have been dropping material from the biography and legacy section of the Bach article at Wikipedia making it unrealistic concerning Bach's legacy. The apparent desire of the recent editors is to present a prettified and Disneyland version of the biography of Bach which deletes the rough times of Bach's legacy immediately after his death and the irreparable losses of huge parts of his manuscripts and compositions. This material was present in the Bach article earlier this year as edited by User:Buxtehude from 27 March 2015 all the way up to the recent forced deletion of the material by two recent editors in preference for the prettified and Disneyland version of Bach's legacy in an idealized version of the Bach article in its current form. The material by Buxtehude should be restored to the article in the realist version of the article which accurately represents the rough times which Bach's legacy faced in its previous Wikipedia form given as: 

:'''Many of Bach's unpublished manuscripts were distributed among the family members at the time of his death. Unfortunately, the poor financial condition of some of the family members led to the undocumented sale or destruction of parts of the unpublished compositions of Bach, including over 100 cantatas and his ''[[St Mark Passion (Bach)|St Mark Passion]]'', of which no copies are known to survive. At one point, the diary of one family member records the selling of the high quality parchment used for the hand-written transcriptions to be used for their stock value as packing paper at a local butcher shop due to harsh financial necessity''', from Buxtehude on 27 March 2015. 

The question for this RfC is: Whether to SUPPORT the restoration of the deleted material of the realistic representation of Bach's legacy from the time of his death 1750 to 1829, which was the year of the Mendelssohn revival of Bach's reputation as a composer?

We need to reach consensus on when/if community radio stations are notable. None of [[WP:BROADCAST]],  [[WP:BCASTOUTCOMES]] and [[WP:NMEDIA]] have the status of ''policy'', however some argue that long-standing norms suggest that broadcast radio stations with a license from a national regulator (OFCOM in the UK, FCC in the USA etc) ''and'' independent notes of existence in local media are notable. Others argue that some/all of these stations are not notable - pointing to the lack of significant secondary references in books and other reliable sources. So the question is this: is a permanent licensed broadcast radio station notable, however small the area of broadcast? If not, how big does the area have to be? Is the standard of having been noted in (let's say) national media as per [[WP:GNG]] relevant?   [[User:JMWt|JMWt]] ([[User talk:JMWt|talk]]) 17:59, 8 December 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I'm wondering about [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ogrodzieniec,_Warmian-Masurian_Voivodeship&diff=prev&oldid=696166839 this edit] I made. Boldfacing the existing instance of "Neudeck" contained in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Lang-de foreign language term template] at the time seemed an expedient way to have a boldface instance present for those arriving via [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neudeck the disambiguation page]. I later reworked another instance of "Neudeck" into the lede text and boldfaced it instead (largely to avoid contentious entanglement with another editor).

*In boldfacing "Neudeck" at all I'm presuming that the convention that holds for a standard name redirect, boldfacing ''"to follow the "principle of least astonishment" after following a redirect"'' ([[MOS:BOLD]]), also logically applies to terms arrived at in similar fashion but directed through an intermediary disambiguation page instead of directly to an article via a name redirect page.

:''Rationale:'' If for example "Neudeck" did not have alternate usages requiring disambiguation then wikilinking <code><nowiki>[[Neudeck]]</nowiki></code> in another article would presumably take one directly to [[Ogrodzieniec, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]] (via a standard name redirect page's functionality). At present wikilinking <code><nowiki>[[Neudeck]]</nowiki></code> in an article takes one to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neudeck a disambiguation page] which then offers a link to the [[Ogrodzieniec, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]] article, amongst others. In such cases it seems fair to say the disambiguation page acts as a specialized form of redirect. One which requires reader discretion and input rather than automatically displaying the target. Via this rationale, it seems fair to extend [[MOS:BOLD]]'s  guidelines on redirect terms and synonyms to terms arrived at via a disambiguation page in lieu of a distinct name redirect.

:*Agree/concur/object/suggest/other relevant guidelines?

*My next premise is the presumption that it doesn't really matter whether boldfaced text in the lede is displayed via boldface markup within template markup, <code><nowiki>{{foo|'''word'''}}</nowiki></code>, or just via boldface markup in the body of text, <code><nowiki>'''word'''</nowiki></code>. ''As the result in the eye of the reader'' '''''is text emphasized via boldface''''' regardless of underlying markup. They see what they see. i.e. I'm presuming the mechanics are irrelevant to the style guideline. Presumably the style guidelines focus on the end result, what is displayed to the reader, leaving the mechanics as a means-to-an-end.

:*Agree/concur/object/suggest/other relevant guidelines?

Getting back to specifics, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ogrodzieniec,_Warmian-Masurian_Voivodeship&diff=prev&oldid=696166839 my edit] was fine, right? And doing so in similar circumstances in the future would typically be within style guidelines as well, correct?

Most recently [[:File:Great Seal of Canada.png|this image]] of the [[Great Seal  of Canada]] has been proposed to be added to the article inlue of the coat of arms (currently in the article).  The question being asked here is in 2 parts....First does the image merit inclusion in the lead (is it a image that represents Canada that it should be a lead image) and secondly is this specific  image of good enough quality to be a lead image in an FA article (can people see what the image is all about).  

*Questions that have been asked and there is no debate over 
:Yes other articles use the seal as a symbol in the lead - eg. [[United States]]
:Yes the Great Seal of Canada is a "National Symbol"  -  [http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1363632655992/1363632732678 source]

'''Recent version:''' Recently, the article stated [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_L._Jones&oldid=695535680]:<blockquote>On September 17, 2015, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' published an article reporting on an upcoming battery booster product, the [[Batteriser]], and controversy surrounding the claim that it could extend battery life by up to eight times.   Dave Jones published at EEVBlog a detailed 40-minute theoretical 'takedown' of Batteroo's claims  without having the product.. The CEO of Batteroo, the [[San Jose]] [[startup company|tech startup]] behind the Batteriser, stated that "every single one" of Jones' points was wrong, indicated that legal action against Jones was being considered, claimed that Jones had no formal electronic engineering credentials, and alleged that Jones was in the employ of [[Duracell]] (a claim that company denied). Three electronics and battery storage experts interviewed for the article concurred in finding the product claims of 8x battery life extension, misleading.<ref name="smh-batteriser">{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/batteriser-battery-life-extender-scam-or-saviour-20150915-gjmrql.html | title=Batteriser battery life extender: scam or saviour? | publisher=Sydney Morning Herald | date=17 Sep 2015 | accessdate=5 November 2015 | last=Francis |first= Hannah |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smh.com.au%2Fdigital-life%2Fdigital-life-news%2Fbatteriser-battery-life-extender-scam-or-saviour-20150915-gjmrql.html&date=2015-11-10|archivedate=November 10, 2015}}</ref>

Earlier, on September 2, 2015, the ''EEVBlog'' channel received a number of "dislikes," which Jones alleged was an attempt to demote the rank of a second video criticizing the Batteriser—it was later discovered that other YouTube channels with videos critical of the Batteriser were similarly affected.<ref>[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/we-dislike-you-vietnam-hackers-give-youtube-videos-thumbs-down-1518821 "Hackers spamming YouTube videos with dislikes using hijacked Vietnamese IP addresses"], ''[[International Business Times]],'' September 7, 2015</ref><ref name="dellsecureworks">[http://www.secureworks.com/resources/blog/negative-feedback-attack-on-a-youtube-channel/ "Negative Feedback – Attack on a YouTube Channel"], , by Joe Stewart, September 3, 2015, ''Dell Secure Networks''</ref> A researcher at [[Dell SecureWorks]] noted that the majority of the dislikes arrived "all at once in massive spikes that did not correlate with an increase in the number of views to the videos being disliked," and explained that dislike spam is a way to manipulate YouTube's view recommendation system.<ref name="dellsecureworks"/></blockquote>

'''Proposed version:''' <blockquote>In mid 2015 Jones published a video blog disputing the claims made by the manufacturer of a then unreleased battery life extender, the [[Batteriser]]. Batteroo, the company behind the product, refuted Jones' arguments and published a number of demonstration videos in response.<ref name="smh-batteriser">{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/batteriser-battery-life-extender-scam-or-saviour-20150915-gjmrql.html | title=Batteriser battery life extender: scam or saviour? | publisher=Sydney Morning Herald | date=17 Sep 2015 | accessdate=5 November 2015 | last=Francis |first= Hannah |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smh.com.au%2Fdigital-life%2Fdigital-life-news%2Fbatteriser-battery-life-extender-scam-or-saviour-20150915-gjmrql.html&date=2015-11-10|archivedate=November 10, 2015}}</ref> Jones' videos received a number of "dislikes," which he alleged was an attempt to demote the their rank. <ref>[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/we-dislike-you-vietnam-hackers-give-youtube-videos-thumbs-down-1518821 "Hackers spamming YouTube videos with dislikes using hijacked Vietnamese IP addresses"], ''[[International Business Times]],'' September 7, 2015</ref>"</blockquote>

Original communication at [[Wikipedia:Bot_requests#AD_.2F_CE_-_BC_.2F_BCE_Suggestion]] moved here as maybe more appropriate space 
I am asking that someone with the necessary skill looks at a BOT that can, if agreed, add the following;
* Link: [[Anno Domini|AD]] to [[Common Era|CE]] and [[BC]] to [[BCE]].This would only need to be done once per article (maybe in the first instance of it occurring) a suitable article, for example, is [[History of timekeeping devices]]. It may also be required to wikilink AD / BC in the first place. If feasible the Bot should be able to reverse link (BCE to BC) the critical action is that AD is linked to CE and BD to BCE, whatever starting point is within the reviewed article. 
* Why: AD and BC are based on a presumed date of a birth of deity and whilst whether it is factually correct is irrelevant, it has become the standard universal dating method. 1) Wikipedia as an encyclopedia, needs to inform that there is alternative terminology, and that within many educational establishments the measurement of time on this scale is taught through CE and BCE. Please see, for example one of many previous discussions at [[Talk:History_of_timekeeping_devices#WP:ERA]]. Whether the link is within the text of the article or separated out for whatever reason is another discussion, the importance is the one link between [[Anno Domini|AD]] to [[Common Era|CE]]and [[BC]] to [[BCE]].

There was already a consensus that articles about ethnic groups or similarly large human populations should not be illustrated by a gallery of images of group members, because selecting them is normally [[WP:OR|original research]], and often contentious (see the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Ethnic_groups&oldid=698001382#Proposal_for_the_deletion_of_all_the_galleries_of_personalities_from_the_infoboxes_of_articles_about_ethnic_groups corresponding discussion]).

I suggest the removal of collage from the infobox, because of lacking objective criteria; it is original research to determine who should be featured in the gallery. Who is for? Who is against?

1933: Ivo refused to be included into the Croatian Lyrics Antology

Source: Научни састанак слависта у Вукове дане, Volume 22, Issues 1-2 Међународни славистички центар, 1994 стр 209

Upon the Mihovil Kombol request for inclusion of his lyrics into the Croatian Lyrics Anthology Ivo replied on November 14 1933: "Не бих никад могао учествовати у једној публикацији из које би принципијелно били искључени други наши мени блиски песници само због тога што су или друге вере или роћени у другој покрајини. То није моје веровање од јуче него од моје прве младости, а сад у зрелим годинама таква се основна вредновања не мењају".

They went to live with her parents in Visegrad on the banks of the Drina, where the young Ivo grew up in an artisan family (his grandfather was a carpenter) playing on the bridge he was later to make so famous, and listening to tales about its origin and history which he used so skillfully to define the character of early Ottoman presence in that remote Bosnian town. The family was orthodox Christian, i.e. Serb; "

Source: Ivo Andric The Bridge on the Drina The University of Chicago Press, 1977 Introduction by William H. McNeil, page 3

We clearly see two facts: Ivo publicly denied his Croatian origins, call himself a Serb; his contemporaries and friends wrote about him being a Serb, which covers a long period of his life from 1914-1975.

William H. McNeill wrote that Ivo's mother was a Serb and that she moved to her parents after her husband's death. This information comes from Ivo and it is in the line of his denial of his Croatian origins. Instead, we read that Ivo's mother moved to her sister in law Ana and her husband Ivan Matkovic (actually Matkovsik) The earliest claim of this type came from a Croat, Z. Juricic in his essays about Andric, ''Letters Ivo Andrić Serbian Heritage Academy, 1984'' стр 85 и ''The Man and the Artist: Essays on Ivo Andrić Želimir B. Juričić University Press of America'', 1986  стр 98  

About his relations with his aunt and her husband we can learn from Ivo's letters form 1918, 1925, 1927 where is no clue about himself moving to live with his aunt after his father death. Juricic did not ever give a primary source supporting his claim. He carefully avoids mentioning Andric distancing himself from the Croats.

Unquestioned about his writing about Andric, William McNeill is quoted at least six times

Should the default [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-rendering-math| Math appearance preference]] (most importantly for non logged in users) be changed from [[PNG]] to [[MathML]]? (getting the legibility on some devices fixed at the same time) [[User:Hungryce|Hungryce]] ([[User talk:Hungryce|talk]])

''' Reference '''

No edits would have to be done because it is simply a [[Special:Preferences|Preference]] at [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-rendering-math]]. As far as I can tell it won't break anything because of it being simply a visual [[Special:Preferences|Preference]]. Any page with math on would be affected but again no actual 'edit' would happen on that page, actually because it is per user the server would not have to do any work. A low spec machine would probably not be running a modern browser that supports MathML and would use SVG or PNG automatically which has the same impact as current math rendering. If there was a problem you could turn it back to PNG or text only. There might me a slight time penalty because you browser would have to figure out what display to use but that would be insignificant compared to the processor use of the browser. No edit-a-thon would be required! The MathML '''is''' already an option, just not the default. I think that it would be the default for new users and a notification would be put out to notify existing users about it.

Non logged in users have no ability to change the [[Special:Preferences|preferences]] and therefor this option. This means that this is even more important for them to have this change because logged in users can edit this if they wish.

I has been noted that in some cases the legibility of primes (example: <math>f'(x), f''(x), f'''(x)</math>) is not so good ([[phab:F199505|screen shot]]) but that can be fixed and if this is passed it will be fixed before the [[Special:Preferences|Preference]] is changed.

There are 2-3 sources which are used for the claim that A is considered pseudoscience. One reference is from the [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiJKseis6OYC&pg=PA20 Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry], which is used to suggest that A is per se pseudoscience. The part cited is rather brief and probably more within the scope of psychological aspects, not judging different herbal remedies. Besides that, there is also the mention that A is probably just a protoscience. But based on the Oxford source alone, when reading the article one gets the impression that almost all of India is just sticking to pseudoscience when it comes to medicine, since the protoscience aspect is only twice mentioned. Pseudoscience is mentioned 5 times. The section on research also mentions pseudoscience, but makes clear distinctions between research and methodologies and thus it depends on applied research methods. 

The main source for the claim is very poor and we should at least name the source instead of giving readers a wrong impression about A in general.

{{rfcquote|text=
We are currently recommending that the sign ⟨ɵ⟩ be used for a reduced vowel diaphoneme that can correspond either to the phoneme /oʊ/ or the phoneme /ə/, for example in the word '''''o'''mission''. Should we continue to do so?

In the IPA, the sign ⟨ɵ⟩ represents the [[close-mid central rounded vowel]]. Our use of ⟨ɵ⟩ is based on {{citation|last=Bolinger|first=Dwight|authorlink=Dwight Bolinger|year=1986|title=Intonation and Its Parts|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=347-360}}. Bolinger proposed not to analyze the reduced vowels as mere versions of the full vowels, but as a special set consisting of three vowels: The “fronted” ''Willie'' vowel /ɨ/, the “central” ''Willa'' vowel /ə/, and the “backed” ''willow'' vowel /ɵ/. Bolinger’s use is slightly different from ours (1) because Bolinger’s /ɵ/ is not a diaphoneme, but a phoneme; (2) because there are words such as ''will'''ow''''' or ''lass'''o''''' or the second part of the {{sc|MOUTH}} diphthong where Bolinger would use /ɵ/, but we would not; and (3) because Bolinger’s analysis allows for an alternation between /ɵ/ and /ə/ in words such as ''can'''o'''py'', ''Ind'''o'''nesia'', ''all'''o'''phonic'', or ''comp'''o'''sition''.

The English Wikipedia is the only major dictionary that has adopted Bolinger’s sign ⟨ɵ⟩ in a broad phonemic IPA transcription scheme (for an overview of other dictionaries’ broad phonemic IPA transcription schemes, see [[Help:IPA conventions for English#Reduced vowels]]).

If you are interested in the edit history of ⟨ɵ⟩ on [[Help:IPA for English]], you may want to check out [[User:J. 'mach' wust/sandbox#Edit history of ⟨ɵ⟩]] (with diff links etc.). --[[User:J.

It is my view that this paper does not support the statement. I have no issue with including a link to the paper within this article, since it's clearly relevant, but as I think I have made clear, ''that is not the place''. To include it as a source for the fact of republication is technically [[WP:OR]] and in any case is unnecessary as the existing secondary source covers it. To include it where it is, as a source for the review process, is simply wrong, as the paper itself does not cover this.

The options appear to be:
# Include the reference as a source for ''In June 2014 Séralini republished the article in the journal ''[[Environmental Sciences Europe]]'', which did not conduct any further [[peer review]]. Reviewers checked only that the scientific content of the paper had not changed.''
# Include the paper within the article, but not as a reference fir this para.

Preventing an [[WP:EDITWAR|edit war]], I have decided to bring this issue to the talk page—which, does not only affect this page. The designation of <code>Queen's Representative&nbsp;–</code> is, in my opinion, an inappropriate one. As there is not always going to be a Queen, this title will render redundant once the royal succession occurs, and we will have to figure whether to have <code>Queen's Representative&nbsp;–</code> or <code>King's Representative&nbsp;–</code>. We cannot have both. <code>Monarchical Representative&nbsp;–</code>, to me, was a compromise and gender-neutral. Among debates with this [[User:Zoltan Bukovszky|user]], he claims that I have ''invented'' the term of Monarchical Representative. This is absolute nonsense. There was nothing to invent, the Queen's Representative (of which there is only one worldwide), is a monarchical representative. This is a description, a designation; '''not''' a title.

Expert attention requested also if somebody here reads Sinhalese readily.

About a week ago, {{userlinks|Ceylonpedia}} added material to the article about destruction of a banyan tree during production of the movie. I rewrote a compromise version of the text, but {{userlinks|Koala15}} deleted it outright.

The issue seems to be the ''Divaina'' story used as a source.[http://www.divaina.com/2015/12/20/feature14.html] It's in Sinhalese, and I'm reading the Google machine-translated version of the text. As best as I can see, the newspaper is accusing the production company of destroying the tree. It's hard to tell if this is an editorial opinion or the result of journalistic investigation, but it feels like the former. So, that creates an issue of [[WP:V|verifiability]] and self-sourcing.

I'd like some fresh eyes to look at this and help determine a few things:
# Is ''Divaina'' a source we should refrain from using?
# If not, is it writing in editorial tone instead of journalistic?
# If it is editorial tone, can we use the material at all, or is it an unbacked allegation? Or, do we need to disclaim it by saying that the newspaper is making the accusation?

Again, I think getting a few more editors involved would help, especially if they can read the article directly. —'''[[User:C.Fred|C.Fred]]''' ([[User_talk:C.Fred|talk]]) 21:17, 25 December 2015 (UTC)}}

'''Question''': Should this article make reference to the Bosnian Serb politician [[Biljana Plavšić]] ''stepping over the body of a dead [[Bosniak]]'' to kiss the Serb paramilitary leader [[Željko Ražnatović]] (aka Arkan)?

The current version of the article makes reference to a photograph in the following terms: {{tq|A photograph, described as "widely-circulated" and "notorious", reportedly shows Plavšić stepping over the body of a dead Bosniak civilian during the kiss.}} The kiss between Plavšić and Arkan is not at issue here, there are many reliable sources that mention it, and it has been accepted as an agreed fact in several prosecutions at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The question of this RfC is whether Plavšić ''stepping over the body of a dead Bosniak'', or words to that effect, should be mentioned in the article, given that a significant number of sources mention this detail while a significant number of sources do not. If you consider it should be mentioned in the article, please indicate what wording you consider should be used. Plavšić is still alive, so [[WP:BLP]] obviously applies. The [[#Table of sourced statements|table below]] lists sources/quotes that <u>mention the "Plavšić stepping over the body of a dead Bosniak to kiss Arkan</u>" detail in some form, as well as a list of sources/quotes that <u>don't mention any dead body</u> during "the kiss". This is a bit of a contentious and complex RfC, so it would be appreciated if interested editors would do a bit of fact-checking/reading before placing a comment either way. I suggest editors use the terms '''Include''' or '''Do not include''' along with their comments and/or suggested wording.

As discussed before,[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_best-selling_music_artists/Archive_32#.23Artists_by_reputed_sales_images_and_500_million_figure] one editor removed the source published by Wiley.com, a highly [[WP:RS]],[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_best-selling_music_artists&diff=next&oldid=691252631] because it is not a "news agencies, and/or music magazines such as Billboard, Rolling Stone", with relation to the 500 million sales figure about Beatles, while accepting[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_best-selling_music_artists&diff=next&oldid=691190456] a totally non-expertised one liner about Elvis Presley having 500 million sales[http://www.ibtimes.com/elvis-presley-quotes-10-things-he-said-remember-icon-anniversary-his-death-2054613].

So we have two proposals here:-

* Remove 500 million sales figure regarding Elvis Presley, because it comes from a random source, having no expertise in sales estimates.

or

* Include 500 million sales figure regarding Beatles, because it is backed by a [[WP:RS]]. [[User:Excelse|Excelse]] ([[User talk:Excelse|talk]]) 16:23, 4 January 2016 (UTC)}}

Any editor may ask the Committee to reconsider or amend a ruling, which the Committee may accept or decline at its discretion.

ITN is occasionally dominated by news of a single type, which is a consequence of several newsworthy items of that type happening at the same time. Should ITN have in-built controls against this happening?

Example: if five countries have elections at the same time and all the articles are updated, ITN may wind up featuring all five elections at the same time. Since there is only so much space, this means ITN becomes politics-dominated. Under the status quo, we live with this until such time as more news items are nominated and posted.

'''Option 1''': Yes. A single news type dominating ITN is a problem. </br>
'''Option 2''': No. A single news type dominating ITN is a problem but the status quo is the best solution. </br>

As the first step to the adoption of Wikidata, I '''propose''' the following:

'''A'''. That we recognize that it is advantageous to read the information about the Commons category on Wikidata rather than to keep it locally - meaning removing the category name parameter from {{tl|commonscat}} (in the situation Wikidata has the info) would not be considered as disruptive and can be, in principle, carried out by bot on a large scale. (I do not intend to do it myself).

'''B'''. If we agree on A, there are two ways to visualize the information (note that they are not mutually exclusive):

'''B1'''. To continue doing what we are already doing, i.e. using {{tl|commonscat}}, {{tl|commonscat-inline}}, and having the dedicated field in some specialized templates (for example, it is included in {{tl|Infobox Russian district}}, see [[Rzhevsky District]] for an example of an application).

'''B2'''. To keep the link to the category on Commons on the left panel, similarly to how it is used in Wikivoyage and some other Wikipedias, see [[:voy:Fontainebleau]] for an example).

PS. I am not aware of any previous discussions of this topic; I will appreciate links if appropriate.
PPS. I in principle intend to advertise this as RfC, however, I would like to wait for a day for comments before adding the template - possibly the issue has been discussed already, or some good ideas will be forthcoming.--[[User:Ymblanter|Ymblanter]] ([[User talk:Ymblanter|talk]]) 11:51, 4 January 2016 (UTC)}}

There is only one photograph (actually, a [[daguerreotype]]) of Emily Dickinson which is known to exist. I'm arguing that the photograph should be used on her article with little to none modifications. A couple of editors have refused to accept that, presenting no decent reasons (other than "[[Wikipedia:I just don't like it|I just don't like it]]"). Since I'm unable to reason with them, I thought it would be wiser to ask others in the community to expose their ideas regarding the subject. My reasoning is quite simple: the version presently in use is small, heavily retouched, with grey tones, and of lesser quality. For me, it makes far more sense to use the original, unedited and with greater quality, version.

Should an "[[a-prefixing]]" guideline be added to [[WP:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Composition titles]]?  Currently, different constructions are used for WP article titles: "[[Frog Went A-Courting]]", "[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]", "[[Hear My Train A Comin']]", "[[Here We Come A-wassailing]]", "[[Hold On, I'm A Comin']]", "[[A-Hunting We Will Go]]", "[[Keep A-Knockin']]", "[[The Times They Are a-Changing]]", "[[Train Kept A-Rollin']]", etc.  The current guideline addresses capitalization for composition titles, but not for "a-prefixing" ("a-Comin'" vs "A-Comin'", etc.).  

A recent discussion has identified several options ("Hear My Train A Comin'" is used to illustrate the differences):

:1) Titles should reflect what is found in a preponderance of reliable sources, regardless of capitalization or use of a hyphen – "Hear My Train A Comin'"

:2) Titles should be standardized to a lower case "a" and hyphen – "Hear My Train a-Comin'"

:3) Titles should be standardized to an upper case "A" and hyphen – "Hear My Train A-Comin'"

:4) Titles should be standardized to an upper case "A" and hyphen, but lower case second part – "Hear My Train A-comin'"

:5) Any combination of lower and upper case is acceptable, as long as a hyphen is used – 2), 3), or 4)

Which of these is preferable for a guideline for all composition titles? —[[User:Ojorojo|Ojorojo]] ([[User talk:Ojorojo|talk]]) 20:34, 20 December 2015 (UTC)}}

==Introduction'''

'''Background'''

{{see also|Wikipedia:2015 administrator election reform/Phase I/RfC|Wikipedia:2015 administrator election reform/Phase II/RfC}}
[[WP:RFA|Requests for adminship]] (commonly abbreviated as "RfA") is the process by which the Wikipedia community selects its [[WP:ADMIN|administrators]], trusted users who have the ability to perform certain technical actions. There is widespread consensus that the RfA process is broken, for various reasons, and many reform efforts over the past years have been unsuccessful. In late 2015, a new project, [[WP:RFA2015|RFA2015]], was launched. In the first phase of this project, which consisted of an [[Wikipedia:2015 administrator election reform/Phase I/RfC|RfC]], the community successfully identified the problems with the RfA process. One of those problems is a hostile environment. In the same RfC, it was suggested that to remedy this problem, we allow certain users (called "clerks") to maintain order and decorum at RfA. 

In his closing statement, the closer of that RfC concluded that the "community would like to discuss the idea of clerking", and we will do that in this RfC. Originally, the issue of clerking was to be discussed as a part of the [[Wikipedia:2015 administrator election reform/Phase II/RfC|Phase II RfC]] for RFA2015, but it was determined that because of the issue's complexity, it would be best to discuss it in a separate RfC. Set forth below are proposals concerning: (1) The responsibilities of RfA clerks; (2) Which users are authorized to perform those tasks. This RfC will run for 30 days and will be as widely advertised as possible, since the results may have a major impact on the RfA process.

On [[Wikipedia talk:Non-free content#Next Steps]], it has been proposed to make a talk header template for the TimedText talk namespace to deal with the following issues:
# The namespace TimedText is generally poorly documented in its purpose, and because of technical restrictions documentation can only be put on TimedText talk pages.
# Some of the TimedText namespace content is non-free content but there is no marking at all about this, or any practice to put Non-free use rationales or such things. Again, any such markings can only be put on the TimedText talk namespace. Discussion on whether having non-free TimedText is desirable or legal is currently happening on the abovelinked talk page.
# TimedText pages can easily become orphaned if the corresponding filepage is deleted/moved; there is no warning to deleting administrators or filemovers that there is a TimedText page.

'''''Propose amending the first sentence of the third paragraph from:'''''

:"Today, in most of the [[Islamic world]], homosexuality is not socially or legally accepted."

'''''To:'''''

:"Prejudice remains, both socially <small>(edit: <s>or</s>)</small> and legally, in most of the [[Islamic world]] against people who engage in homosexual acts."


Beyond a problem of a clear generalization being presented in regard to LGBT people not being "socially accepted", the issue here, that has already received a lengthy introduction in the previous two paragraphs, is one of prejudice. As the next sentence clearly demonstrates, the issue may frequently be a matter of life and death.

:"... In [[LGBT in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[LGBT rights in Brunei |Brunei]], [[LGBT rights in Iran|Iran]], [[LGBT rights in Mauritania|Mauritania]], [[LGBT rights in Nigeria|Nigeria]], [[LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], [[LGBT rights in Sudan|Sudan]] and [[LGBT rights in Yemen|Yemen]], homosexual activity carries the [[death penalty]]."

In other Wikipedia articles such as those on the treatment of Jews, gypsies and black people in WWII Germany, and article would not merely say that these people were "not ... accepted" not least because that would not be true.  Wikipedia even present: [[:Category:Rescue of Jews in the Holocaust]].  People in such circumstances were taken into homes, hidden, protected and certainly accepted.  In a similar way it seems to me that Wikipedia goes too far with its unsubstantiated claim that "homosexuality is not socially ... accepted" "in most of the [[Islamic world]]".  As with all similar issues, it depends on the extent of their prejudice of the people concerned.  

<small>I will leave a link to this thread at [[:WP:LGBT]] and [[:WP:Islam]] and Ping recent contributors to the article: {{u|Alexis Ivanov}}, {{u|AstroLynx}}, {{u|BethNaught}}, {{u|Bgwhite}}, {{u|BorgQueen}}, {{u|Chrisdike95}}, {{u|Contaldo80}}, {{u|Deisenbe}}, {{u|DMacks}}, {{u|Dialectric }}, {{u|Erodes43}}, {{u|Flyer22 Reborn}}, {{u|GermanJoe}}, {{u|GorgeCustersSabre }}, {{u|I dream of horses}}, {{u|Ibrahim Husain Meraj}}, {{u|Instantpancakes350}}, {{u|JCO312}}, {{u|Jeff5102}}, {{u|Lutipri}}, {{u|Maplestrip}}, {{u|Nematsadat}}, {{u|Nøkkenbuer}}, {{u|Philip Trueman}}, {{u|Rupert loup}}, {{u|Serols}}, {{u|Tadeusz Nowak}}, {{u|Talebhaq}}, {{u|Tymon.r}}, {{u|Winner 42}}</small>

== RFC regarding AAU subsection.  '''

There's an ongoing dispute over how to deal with an editorial argument in the subsection on the recent AAU report. Specifically, the section presents a statistic that most people who experienced a sexual assault who did not report the incident said that they did so because they "did not believe it was serious enough to report". It then presents this argument from an editorial by Stuart Taylor jr.: "Stuart Taylor, writing for the Washington Post, remarked "This most plausible explanation is that most of those classified by the survey as “victims” of sexual assault or rape did not really think that they had been sexually assaulted."" The question is over where/whether to include Taylor's comment, and over whether or not it is appropriate to note, in that section, statements from past research that challenge arguments similar to the one made by Taylor regarding the AAU study. A few solutions that have been proposed are:

*1. Leave the entry as is, or use a similar argument from a different editorial such as [http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2015/09/aau_campus_sexual_assault_survey_why_such_surveys_don_t_paint_an_accurate.2.html this one] by Emily Yoffe. 

*2. Move the quote and statistic to a separate subsection that addresses the causes of non-reporting, while also discussing past research on non-reporting, and the "not serious enough to report" response, and the criticisms voiced by people like Taylor.

*3. Leave Taylor's argument where it is, but also cite past research that disputes Taylor's argument within the AAU section.

Alright. This has gone on waaaaay too long, with no apparent progress. I'm going to try my hardest to present a fair and neutral introduction to this. Additionally, {{u|GoneIn60}} suggested above that any previous users in this discussion (myself included) should hold off on stating a position in this matter until some (hopefully) third party editors weigh in. With that out of the way, here we go.

The topic being discussed is "Should ''Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens'' appear as an alternate title in the lead in the following format: '''''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''''' (also known as '''''Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens''''') is a 2015 American..." Here is (to the best of my ability) the summaries of both positions, for '''not''' including, and including.

;Option 1 - Not including
* [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/star-wars-episode-vii-title-747060 On November 6, 2014, the official title of the film was revealed as ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'']. ''Episode VII'' is notably absent from the title.
* TheForce.net [http://www.theforce.net/story/front/Star_Wars_Episode_VII_Will_Be_Called_The_Force_Awakens_160763.asp received confirmation] from LucasFilm that (emphasis theirs) "'''"Episode VII" will not be in the title, but it will be in the opening crawl.''' The movie is officially titled ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''."
* The official Star Wars Twitter account [https://twitter.com/starwars/status/531980698190487552 tweets] the following response to a fan regarding not having "Episode VII" in the title: "The original trilogy never used the Episode number in the official title. We'll still be using it on the crawl. :)"
* The film's billing block is released on the official poster, with the title of the film, again, just ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''. A large version of the poster can be seen [http://a.dilcdn.com/bl/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/10/star-wars-force-awakens-official-poster.jpg here]. Note that [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/02/24/opinion/sunday/ben-schott-movies-billing-blocks.html billing blocks have very strict guidelines and legal ramifications] for their order and the formatting and inclusion of everything.
* ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'' both did not have the episode numbers in their titles, only being featured in the crawl as well. They are not also known by the titles ''Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'' until George Lucas rereleases them with these titles.
* The vast majority of sources do not use this title. And the very few that do, do not add enough weight at this time.
* The film will most likely be retitled with Episode VII in its title some where down the line (possibly even with its home media release) or in a rerelease with the other sequel trilogy films, or all 9. But as of "today" (ie the end of 2015), this is not the case.

;Option 2 - Including
* Consistency across the other episodic Star Wars films
* Before November 6, 2014, it was known simply as ''Star Wars Episode VII''
* It is featured in the crawl, which would thus make the title ''Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens'' valid, or at least an alternate to the actual title.
* There are reliable sources that include it in the title, albeit with different formattings.
**''Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens'' (supported by [http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_episode_vii_the_force_awakens/ RT], [http://www.metacritic.com/movie/star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens MC], and [http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-2015 RogerEbert.com])
**''Star Wars – Episode VII: The Force Awakens'' (supported by [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-star-wars-the-force-awakens-posters-revealed-20151104-htmlstory.html LATimes])
**''Star Wars, Episode VII: The Force Awakens'' (supported by [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/12/22/how-star-wars-episode-vii-the-force-awakens-missed-a-huge-opportunity/ WashingtonPost])
* ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' is only a marketing title
* It is shown as ''Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens'' [http://www.starwars.com/films on StarWars.com]

I believe that's it. Again, I did my very best to present both sides of the argument equally. If there is one side that does not have some of their points represented, let me know and I will adjust. I will also drop a neutral notices at the film project and some third party editors from the film project who I feel would provide some good comments to this discussion.

There is zero support for deleting old drafts. We should remove the entire concept of STALEDRAFTs.

*'''Conditional <s>support</s> oppose''' (Switch to oppose - apparently this does not apply only to stale draft deletions, as the [[Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion#G13_Drafts|concurrent discussion]] led me to infer.) This needs to be better worded, something like "Stale drafts not covered by CSD should not be deleted", but I understand the intention. My thinking leads me to support this, but the policy of deleting STALEDRAFTs can't have arisen for no reason. It would be very helpful if someone could supply the rationale for why MfD deletion is sometimes used instead of, for example, [[:Template:Userpage blanked]], which does not consume admin time and is friendlier for the author. Aren't the provisions for speedy deletion under G3, G4, G6, G10, G11, G12, and G13 sufficient for all conceivable cases in which deletion would be appropriate?

Does Wikipedia need reform? Please see [[Wikipedia:Reform of Wikipedia]] for ideas.

''' Background '''

Most of the time I edit an article there is conflict. For example, both anti-fringe editors and advocates take sides like a football [[WP:GAME]] and admins continue to ignore OR and other problems. The only way for change is for the rules to be consistently enforced, but that seems impossible under the current Wikipedia model.

Previously, we had an RfC which  asked,

:::'''to'''

:::'''Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, country of origin, or conclusions.'''

and the result of that RfC was, '''Yes'''. [[Wikipedia_talk:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)/Archive_19|The full result can be read here.]] In that close, the closer, Elvey made these points:

*# That, yes, a change is needed
*# There was consensus that "country of origin", per se, is not a valid reason to reject a source
*# Rejecting a source based on "country of origin" was no more valid than rejecting based on "funding sources"
*# That it should not be read as a PC ban where we cannot mention country of origin in discussions (see

*# That it should not be read as changing the longstanding policy that sources from publications known to routinely publish and fail to retract material proven unreliable may be excluded.

Implementing the plain language resulting from that RfC has, however, created more edit warring. There have been concerns that unreliable sources will make their way onto Wikipedia, but those concerns were already heard in the original RfC. Still, adding language to ensure that unreliable sources do not find their way onto Wikipedia may be necessary. Or it may not. This RfC seeks to resolve that by asking, based on the closer's 5 points, what version does it best? Of the versions that address all five points, these are proposed:

*# Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, country of origin, or conclusions.
*# Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, country of origin, or conclusions. However, sources from publications known to routinely publish and fail to retract material proven unreliable may be excluded.

Both of these options meet all five points, but I also ask the community for additional options '''that meet the five criteria outlined above''' and found in the original close. Please vote #1, #2 or an altogether different option below. [[User:LesVegas|LesVegas]] ([[User talk:LesVegas|talk]]) 18:49, 11 January 2016 (UTC)}}

The question is: '''should "seven days" mean the seventh day or 168 hours?'''

''' Closing comments '''

(To be filled out by closing administrator)

''' Background '''

The religion entry in infoboxes has been a contentious issue for many years, with multiple participants disputing what, if anything, should come after the "Religion = " entry. Previous discussions  and RfCs have made it abundantly clear that only actual religions should be listed, never anything that is a non-religion.

A [[Template talk:Infobox person/Archive 28#RfC: Religion infobox entries for individuals that have no religion|previous RfC]] determined that there is a clear consensus for removing the religion parameter for individuals (living, deceased, and fictional), groups, schools, institutions, and political parties hat have no religion, but that RfC was determined by the closing administrator to not apply to nations. A [[Template talk:Infobox country/Archive 11|follow-up RfC]] determined that the consensus was the same for nations, states, etc.

Despite the previous RfCs, we still have a problem with editors edit warring to keep various nonreligions in the religion entry, arguing that their favorite page is not covered by the existing RfCs. This [[WP:RfC|RfC]] is an attempt to create a bright line answer concerning exactly what the [[WP:CONSENSUS|consensus]] is concerning the religion entry for all infoboxes in all Wikipedia articles, without exception.

''' Examples '''

{{collapse top}}
Examples of religions: Baha'i, Baptist, Buddhist, Caodaist, Catholic, Christian, Confucianist, Hindu, Jain, Judaism, Latter Day Saint/Mormon, Lutheran, Muslim/Islam, Orthodox, Pentecostal, Presbyterian, Shamanist, Shiite, Shinto, Sikh, Sunni, Tao, Wicca. 

Examples of nonreligions: Agnostic, Antireligionist, Apatheist, Atheist, Communist, Ignosticist, Irreligion, Leninist, Marxist, NA, Non-practicing X, Nonbeliever, None, Nontheist, Raised as an X, Secularist, State atheism, Unknown.

("Jew/Jewish" is a special case. The word has several meanings, so the source cited needs to specify the Jewish religion, as opposed to someone who lives in Israel or has a Jewish mother.)

''' What this RfC is and is not '''

This RfC only applies to infoboxes, not to the body of the article.

This RfC only applies to the religion field of the infobox.

This RfC does not address whether the religion parameter should be changed to something else or omitted entirely from the template. 

This RfC does not change the existing strong consensus that religion in the infobox must be relevant (per the template guideline), supported by reliable sources, and covered in the body of the article.

''' Support / Oppose '''

'''Proposal: In all infoboxes in all Wikipedia articles, without exception, nonreligions should not be listed in the religion parameter ("Religion = ") of the infobox.''' 

* '''Support'''.  Didn't we already settle this in some other rfc?  For the same reasons as last time, I will support this.  It would be nice if we had an appropriate infobox parameter to summarize atheistic beliefs, but "religion = " is not the one.  For prominent atheism activists, such as Richard Dawkins, we can put "atheism activism" in "known for = ".  For others, their atheism is not a religion and shouldn't be treated as such.  If the question were, "Is this person religious?", then the answer could be "no".  But when the question is, "What religion is this person?", there's really no applicable answer for atheists.  We don't put "None (unmarried)" under "Spouse = " when someone is single. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 03:11, 3 January 2016 (UTC)}}

{{archive top|There is a remarkable degree of heat given that this is basically tabloid tittle-tattle. As Collect notes, agreement of various editors cannot trump policy: independent sources establish that the term is at least somewhat speculative, and even the subject of the claim appears not to have used it in the unambiguous sense supported by some editors here. The solution is to use [[WP:ATT|attribution]] and to take care not to exceed what is stated by the sources (e.g: "Mrs Gillespie was once the secret lover of Australian prime minister Harold Holt - or the alleged secret lover, as has frequently been recorded in the years following Holt's disappearance and prior to her own - as is reporting convention." from the Aus. Daily Telegraph). Terms such as "claimed lover" or "alleged lover" would not violate policy, an overt claim of "lover" probably does, from my reading of this debate, the sources and the relevant policies. And omitting it altogether? That would be perfect. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 13:13, 2 February 2016 (UTC)}}

When I originally created this article I used the term "rump militia" in lieu of "militia" (the specific term used by news sources) to provide just a basic level of clarification for our non-American readers that these were not governmental military units. "Rump militia" has wider historic, geographical usage as a term indicating non state-sanctioned paramilitary groups and is often specifically invoked in specialist and lay observer circles to refer to groups associated with the militia movement in the United States and differentiate from the [[National Guard]] and [[State Defense Forces]], the latter of which sometimes specifically also use the word "militia" in their names. Recently, IP editors have started changing this to "civilian militia" throughout the article, contending "rump militia" displays bias. What term should be used? 
* armed gang

* civilian Militia

There are a handful of instances where the shadowing of commons files is done deliberately, either as a placeholder to prevent poorly-named uploads (such as [[:File:Background.jpg]]), or because Commons has a bizarre picture for a simple name (i.e. the widely used [[:File:Otters.jpg]] which shadows [[:Commons:File:Otters.jpg]]). Nevertheless, these images are tagged with {{tl|ShadowsCommons}} and appear in [[:Category:Wikipedia files that shadow a file on Wikimedia Commons]] as backlog items to be cleared.

I propose that an optional parameter, <code>deliberate=</code> be added to {{tl|ShadowsCommons}}, which, if set to true, causes the template to note that no action is required and places the file in a new category [[:Category:Wikipedia files that shadow a file on Wikimedia Commons (no action required)]] (a subcat of the above) so that they can be distinguished from backlog items needing attention. --[[User:LukeSurl|LukeSurl]]<sup> [[User Talk:LukeSurl|t]] [[Special:Contributions/LukeSurl|c]]</sup> 17:58, 3 January 2016 (UTC)}}

the [[symmetry breaking]] of light is itself observation, which is relevant to my previous post:

space-time dictated by the uncertainty principle generates the multiverse which is an "infinitely" evolving fractal feedback loop(every-thing is a re-source from the singularity) through the quanta of all our minds which are folds/symmetry-breaks of/in space-time. our minds are themselves tachyon particles simply because we can visualize potential future states before the light of that event occurs in reality, if you believe multiverse theory you can reasonably assume that future state manifests in a parallel universe even if not in your own, our mind is a fold of spacetime where the purely abstract mathematical truth of a wave meets reality in the form of consciousness. necessarily the mind is also a superposition or 'entangled' with the 'abstract' uncertainty|certainty of the 'real' past|future, always obeying the uncertainty principle of information. through the uncertainty principle your mind is semi-randomly phase transitioning/symmetry breaking a novel worldline through the multiverse, helping to generate infinite complexity. perfect randomness is itself perfect infinity.

As the subtitle asks, should this article cover Exposing for the Highlights? Please read the above section before providing opinions. The IP editor appears to believe that any exposure in which the histogram reaches the right edge (without clipping) is a form of ETTR, even if the resultant image is underexposed. There are indeed (non-WP) articles online that make the same assertion, but they do not explain that underexposure negates the benefits of ETTR (in fact, having the ''opposite'' effects). Also, should the article explain that ETTR is not intended for high-DR scenes? Unfortunately I have not been able to provide good references for that, and even though it is self-evident with a little experimentation [[WP:OR|original research]] is not permitted on WP.

I think that this article should be moved to the title ''Meshblock'' or possibly ''Mesh Block''. Where an article is about something that can be both singular or plural a singular title is probably a better title. From what I can tell, the term '''meshblock''' is used by Statistics New Zealand, while the term '''Mesh Block''' is used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They have fairly similar definitions. The only articles that currently link to the article about ''[[Mesh blocks]]'' are all related to  Statistics New Zealand surveys. Also this article is ranked as a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_New_Zealand/Assessment#Importance_scale|mid-importance]] New Zealand article. Currently there are two(2) Wikipedia articles relating to Australia that use '''mesh blocks''' or '''Mesh Blocks'''. Also when it is used elsewhere it is usually written as a proper noun '''Mesh Block''', often as a pural, from Australian sources mostly concerning the Austrailan Census. However, there are at least ten(10) New Zealand related Wikipedia articles that contain '''Meshblock''' or '''Meshblocks'''. Elsewhere the term '''meshblock''' is dominated by material from New Zealand sources and while these are also generally related to the New Zealand Census, the breadth and scope of these sources are far wider than for Australia. There is no obvious evidence that ''meshblock'' or ''mesh block'' are used elsewhere in the world. Although other agencies may have a similar concept, they use different names and definitions. Considering this, my preferred title is '''[[Meshblock]]'''. At this stage I don't think there is a need for a separate '''Mesh Block''' article, as I suspect the Australian term has been borrowed from the New Zealand usage.

 I think the article should omit the the lists of individual anti-semitic incidents in order to be more encyclopedic and better fit my understanding of wikipedia standards. The issue is that Wikipedia is not a newspaper [[WP:NOTNP]] and this seems like a haphazard list of recent and not particularly noteworthy or historically significant anti-semitic incidents. Also see [[WP:RECENT]]. I think much of this content will not pass the ten-year test. Other editors seem to disagree with me, and it would be good to have some additional eyes on this. See above discussion under [[Talk:Antisemitism in_the_United_States#College_campuses_section_has_too_much_of_a_newspaper_quality_to_it]] although I think this same critique applies to lists of incidents outside the colleage campuses section.

For some time admins have been working in a limbo state where they are unblocking with conditions on further editing but don't have a policy basis to support them. This will be even more important now that the Arbitration Committee has handed block and ban appeals back to the community to deal with (note I'm proposing this as a community member not as an arb). I propose that the following be added as a section under the Unblocking section, the wording proposed has been discussed [[#Unblock conditions|above]] so that is probably useful reading for interested people.<b>[[User:Callanecc|Callanecc]]</b> ([[User talk:Callanecc|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Callanecc|contribs]] • [[Special:Log/Callanecc|logs]]) 07:37, 18 January 2016 (UTC)}}

I was going to post this but no one seems to check its talk page too much anymore so might as well post this here, and plus is this quite an notable issue. [http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog PHL] (some people call it by the project name HEC), once agian has reformated their listings of Habitable exoplanets, They have split the list into a "Conservative" and "Optimistic" lists which was well needed indeed. The formatting of PHL's lists is drastically different and included values that [[List of potentially habitable exoplanets]] doesn't list, and [[List of potentially habitable exoplanets]] lists values like SPH, HZC, and HZA which are no where to be found on the PHL's page (Some older archived lists from PHL used the HZD [http://phl.upr.edu/library/notes/latestlistofpotentialhabitableexoplanetsandexomoons (like this one)], but generally it has been replaced with Stellar flux Denoted as S<sub>E</sub>, S<sub>⊕</sub> or [http://www.drewexmachina.com/2015/12/19/habitable-planet-reality-check-wolf-1061/ S<sub>eff</sub>](<- See table 1 in that link) (But generally in Scientific papers S<sub>eff</sub> appears to be most commonly used) to critique planatary habitability (Just look at that link I just posted)). Not to mention so many KOI's that aren't on [http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog/data PHL's KOI List] which we do have [[List of Potentially Habitable Exoplanets Kepler Candidates|a better orginized list than this one]] that acctually has the ones that are there, plus some other ones that are backed by ''Nasa's Exoplanet Archive''. I'm thinking we should just redo the whole list from PHL's data as since there is no explanatory citation for any of the other units presented it must of all came from thin air. Another question that we have to answer is if we want a two separate tables (on the same page) for exoplanets in the "Conservative" HZ and "Optimistic" HZ or continue on with lumping all of them into one table or have all 3 tables on the same page or a sort of compromise which would be a single table, with some sort of sorter that would allow us to sort out "Optimistic" HZ planets and "Conservative" HZ planets. For the format of the table I nominate the PHL style format which can be seen in use [[List of Potentially Habitable Exoplanets Kepler Candidates|here]]. <span style="border:2px solid #090E0E;padding:0px;"><font style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#000000;">[[User:Davidbuddy9|Davidbuddy9]]</font>[[User talk:Davidbuddy9|<font style="color:#000000;background:#FFFFFF;">&nbsp;Talk&nbsp;</font>]] </span> 01:10, 9 January 2016 (UTC)}}

Should "[[Sugar Mama (Led Zeppelin song)]]" be merged with "[[Sugar Mama (song)]]"?  

"Sugar Mama" is a [[blues]] song that was recorded as early as 1934.  Although he did not record it until 1937, the song is often attributed to or associated with [[Sonny Boy Williamson I]] (Herzhaft, ''Encyclopedia of the Blues''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2CGNaUpGcbcC&pg=PA473&dq=sugar+mama+herzhaft&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjp1tKfqp3KAhVKbj4KHW9XCgcQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=sugar%20mama%20herzhaft&f=false)]).  It has been recorded by numerous artists, often with variations in the lyrics and music ([[Tampa Red]], [[Tommy McClennan]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[B.B. King]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Taste (band)|Taste]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], etc.) with credits to various songwriters.  

In 1969, during their recording sessions for ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', [[Led Zeppelin]] recorded a preliminary/demo "Sugar Mama" with somewhat different lyrics and arrangement.  The song was included on the expanded edition of ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]'' in 2013.  The album lists it as "Sugar Mama (Mix)" and is credited to "Page, Plant".

Two reliable sources have identified Sonny Boy Williamson as the source of LZ's version:
*"Sugar Mama: A cover of a Sonny Boy Williamson song recorded in June 1969 at Morgan Studios for ''Led Zepplin II''&nbsp;..." (Williamson, ''The Rough Guide to Led Zeppelin''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xR_upC_tDzUC&pg=PA213&dq=%22sugar+mama%22+%22zeppelin%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz--Sm-prKAhVBWWMKHcdhCnwQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=%22sugar%20mama%22%20%22zeppelin%22&f=false]).
*"the still unissued [by 2005] Zep version of Sonny Boy Williamson's 'Sugar Mama' from the ''Led Zeppelin II'' sessions&nbsp;..." (Shadwick, ''Led Zeppelin: The Story of a Band and Their Music, 1968-80''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KXF9sfBhIdoC&pg=PA319&dq=%22sugar+mama%22+%22zeppelin%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz--Sm-prKAhVBWWMKHcdhCnwQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&q=%22sugar%20mama%22%20%22zeppelin%22&f=false]).
A review of other Led Zeppelin biographies has not revealed that their song is a unique, original composition.

[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Songs]] provides the following guidance:
{{blockquote|When a song has renditions (recorded or performed) by more than one artist, discussion of a particular artist's rendition should be included in the song's article (never in a separate article), but only if at least one of the following applies:
:*the rendition is discussed by a reliable source on the subject of the song,
:*the rendition itself meets the notability requirement at [[WP:NSONGS]]. ([[WP:COVERSONG]])}}

{{rfcquote|text=
In the encyclopedia, the manual of style recommends the following with regards synonyms:
{{Quote frame|[...] the title can be followed in the first line by one or two alternative names in parentheses|[[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Lead_section#Usage in first sentence]]}}
{{Quote frame|Alternatively, if there are more than two alternative names, these names can be moved to and explained in a "Names" or "Etymology" section; it is recommended that this be done if there are at least three alternate names, or there is something notable about the names themselves. Once such a section or paragraph is created, the alternative English or foreign names should not be moved back to the first line|[[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Lead_section#Separate_section_usage]]}}

Medical conditions frequently have many synonyms (e.g. [[Burning mouth syndrome]]). 

The idea of including a list of synonyms in the infobox medical condition started on WT:MED (permalink here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Medicine&type=revision&diff=697421766&oldid=697421361]). James has kindly made a preview, seen here: [[Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome]]. Another idea for dealing with the list of synonyms is to have them as a footnote (e.g. [[geographic tongue]], this method discussed on WT:MED here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_75#List_of_synonyms_in_lead]).

If there is support for the above idea, then this raises other questions: should the list of synonyms replace entirely the list of synonyms in the lead, or elsewhere in the article? Or should the infobox be in addition to a list of synonyms in the lead or in a section within the article?

{{rfcquote|text=
There's an ongoing dispute over how to deal with an editorial argument in the subsection on the recent AAU report. Specifically, the section presents a statistic that most people who experienced a sexual assault who did not report the incident said that they did so because they "did not believe it was serious enough to report". It then presents this argument from an editorial by Stuart Taylor jr.: "Stuart Taylor, writing for the Washington Post, remarked "This most plausible explanation is that most of those classified by the survey as “victims” of sexual assault or rape did not really think that they had been sexually assaulted."" The question is over where/whether to include Taylor's comment, and over whether or not it is appropriate to note, in that section, statements from past research that challenge arguments similar to the one made by Taylor regarding the AAU study. A few solutions that have been proposed are:

*1. Leave the entry as is, or use a similar argument from a different editorial such as [http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2015/09/aau_campus_sexual_assault_survey_why_such_surveys_don_t_paint_an_accurate.2.html this one] by Emily Yoffe. 

*2. Move the quote and statistic to a separate subsection that addresses the causes of non-reporting, while also discussing past research on non-reporting, and the "not serious enough to report" response, and the criticisms voiced by people like Taylor.

*3. Leave Taylor's argument where it is, but also cite past research that disputes Taylor's argument within the AAU section.

I have debated beforehand that Muhammad is quite far from being 'widely considered' the founder of Islam, at least not by Muslims authors and society in general (which represent 1.6 billion people in the world). There are only a handful Muslims, mostly authors from the UK and Pakistan (non scholars of Islam) who consider him the 'founder of Islam' and I urge you to prove it otherwise; of all the sources found, most are from encyclopedias and books on terrorism, and a few from Christian authors. This induces a Christian POV into the text. I suggest removing the phrase, for the sake of the article itself. ''Note: Jesus is never considered the founder of Christianity, for example, since these people are considered prophets of religion and not founders, and whoever says otherwise is inadvertently adding a point of view which doesn't fit with the style of the text.'' --[[User:92slim|92slim]] ([[User talk:92slim|talk]]) 19:50, 29 January 2016 (UTC)}}

This RfC asks the participants to weigh in on how the photo which is claimed to depict Billy the Kid playing Croquet should be represented in the article - as an authentic photo or as a photo of disputed authenticity. This diff [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Billy_the_Kid&type=revision&diff=703130004&oldid=703048856] illustrate the type of changes that we are considering although the topic of the RfC are not these exact changes, but the general principle they illustrate - whether the most recent expert opinion by Kagin's inc and the National Geographic team can be considered to have established the authenticity beyond doubt, or whether the expressed doubts of historians (who wrote before Kagin inc's final conclusion) should still be considered to continue to throw doubt on the photo's authenticity. Participants are request to give their opinion about whether the photo should be described as '''authentic''' or as '''disputed''' within the article.


;Survey
*'''Disputed''' Several experts have provided their opinions about the authenticity of the photo - a number of experts argue that it is highly unlikely to be authentic, and one set of experts have examined the photo in 2015 and stated that they consider it authentic. Given the recency of these opinions it is still to be seen which of these claims will be adopted by historians of Billy the Kid. The stakes of claiming authenticity are very high as they raise the value of the photo in question from 2 dollars to 5 million dollars. So as to not inadvertently become a party in this issue the safest solution for Wikipedia and for our readers is to be conservative and note that the authenticity of the photo remains disputed - giving the opinions of experts from both sides without taking a final stance on the question. The matter of the photo's authenticity can always be revisited when historians evaluate the standing of the evidence on the matter in the future.

'''Summary (see version 1 for further text and references)'''



'''Prosection'''
Kosovo prosecution claims that Muhaxheri has traveled to Syria at two occasions between 2012- 2013 in a group of individuals from Kosovo, many of the members have been pointed out as students of imams at a mosque in Kosovo.The Kosovo prosecution have requested and been granted an international warrant for Muhaxheri’s arrest based on his affiliation with the group, which is affiliated  with Islamic State based on textmessages between Muhaxheri, an imam and other indicted members. The textmessages that Muhaxheri has obtained from the imam and other members include instructions related to recruitment, such as escorting recruited members between Syria and Turkey. The Kosovo prosecution has said that Muhaxheri didn’t participate in the fighting with the other indicted members of the group. Muhaxheri was last reported to be in Syria on 5 Oktober 2013, based on textmessages

'''Media coverage'''
There are media reports have claimed that  Muhaxheri appears in the following videos and footage; IS –propagandafilm Clanging of the Swords IV, an RPG – video, on beheading footage from Syria, a video from Iraq. 
There are media reports that have claimed that Muhaxheri has been killed in Syria and Iraq at three different occasions between 2014-2015. These reports have been denounced in other media reports that have claimed that publicized images and comments at IS militant Facebook accounts disconfirm  the reports of Muhaxheri’ s death.
In 2015 there are several media reports about Muhaxheri’s whereabouts that have been denounced by authorities; in November - December 2015 Muhaxheri was reported to be in Macedonia. This was denounced by Macedonian police department. In November 2015 Muhaxheri was  reported to be in Kacanik, Kosovo, the report was  denounced by Kosovo authorities. In December 2015 Muhaxheri was reported to be paralyzed in Syria, and later in December 2015 Muhaxheri was reported not to be paralyzed and to be in ar – Rutbah Iraq , on Muhaxheri was reported to be in Albania, this was denounced by an  Albanian International Affairs analyst due to unverifiabillity. 

'''Forensic and analyst opinions'''
The forensic anlazysts  of the published videos and footage alleged to be of Lavdrim Muhaxheri are not convinced that the footage is of the same individual and when and where the footage is taken. 

On IS –propagandafilm Clanging of the Swords IV;
According to Ebi Spahiu, a researcher at the Albanian Institute of International Affairs(AIIS);"he [Muhaxheri] would have come out with a stronger message".[1]

On RGP video
Researcher Ebi Spahiu stated that Muhaxheri was in the video but questioned whether it was new footage that proved he was still alive; "The media in Kosovo and Albania are treating it as a new video without considering that it may be old [footage]". Foreign policy analyst Adrian Shtuni stated that it was possible that the video was new footage, or at least newer than August 2014 but questioned whether Muhaxheri was in the video;"In a photograph of Muhaxheri taken around the summer of 2014, the militant appears to be heavier than he is in the video, although his outfit is the same", suggesting that the RPG video was taken at a different time than the two photographs. Foreign policy analyst Shtuni further claimed that it was possible that Muhaxheri was emulating other senior IS figures.

I have removed this statement: 
:'''''She was the first woman to expose her navel on television'''''.
(sourced: {{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/cher-on-the-cover-of-love-magazine-queen-of-chiffon-and-sequins-is-the-ultimate-fashion-icon-10411943.html|first=Alexander|last=Fury|title=Cher on the cover of Love magazine: Queen of chiffon and sequins is the ultimate fashion icon|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=July 23, 2015|accessdate=January 18, 2016}})

This source is simply not true.  [[Gene Roddenberry]] of [[Star Trek]] fame, had on-going disputes with the TV censors about navel exposure. In 1973 during the filming of Genesis II, he finally got even by giving [[Mariette Hartley]] with two navels - one her own, and a fake one.  In one of the Star Trek episodes in 1967, "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]", Uhura did show a navel, but it was missed by the censors - ten years before Cher's exposure...

Gene made several public statements about this issue (which I personally heard in person). Sources about the above statement:
*http://trekmovie.com/2009/10/02/roddenberrys-genesis-ii-and-planet-earth-coming-to-dvd/

*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_II_%28film%29

:File:Emily Dickinson daguerreotype (Restored).jpg|Presently used as the main picture. Small, heavily retouched and dark/white tone.
:File:Black-white photograph of Emily Dickinson2.jpg|The original photo, with no modifications.
</gallery>
There is only one photograph (actually, a [[daguerreotype]]) of Emily Dickinson which is known to exist. I'm arguing that the photograph should be used on her article with little to none modifications. I thought it would be wiser to ask others in the community to expose their ideas regarding the subject. My reasoning is quite simple: the version presently in use is small, heavily retouched, with grey tones, and of lesser quality. For me, it makes far more sense to use the original, unedited and with greater quality, version. Please, share your thoughts. --[[User:Lecen|Lecen]] ([[User talk:Lecen|talk]]) 18:58, 19 January 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Should ALL attacks by any organization labelled as a terrorist Organization and present in [[List of designated terrorist groups]] be called as "Terrorist" attacks as per the essay at [[WP:BLUE]] or should we bind editors to cite reliable sources for each attack. The arguments against this are that as per [[WP:BLUE]] essay we do not need to cite the obvious as they have been labelled as terrorist every attack made by them should be called terrorism. While the arguments against are that [[WP:Verifiability]] and [[WP:No original research]] are both policies and compliance with them is not optional and that these organizations attack a plethora of targets from other terrorists to common civilians, so we should wait until an RS calls something a terrorist attack before including it. The two options being given through this RFC are
# Every Incident included here should be sourced to a [[WP:RS]] which calls it a terrorist incident. There is a strong need to cite [[WP:RS]] which uses the word terrorist incident or its synonyms. e-g An attack by [[Taliban]] anywhere in the world will be included only when a reliable source calls it a terrorist attack. TLDR '''both "Islamist" and "terrorist" must be explicitly cited in RS as motivations for the attack to be included on the list '''
# Any terrorist attack by an organization labelled as a terrorist organization should be included. There is no need to cite any reliable source which labels this as a terrorist attack as these organizations have already been labelled terrorists by [[WP:RS]] the essay allowing this is [[WP:BLUE]]. e.g [[Taliban]] are terrorists, therefore any attack by them, whether in Afghanistan to capture new bases from another terrorist organization, or on civilians in Pakistan, is terrorism and should be included here as per [[WP:BLUE]]. TLDR '''any attack described in RS by a designated terrorist group adhering to Islamist ideology should be included on this list'''

There is a suggestion to clarify the way privy counsellors are identified in opening sentences and infoboxes. Currently the most common method is to add the "Rt Hon" prefix for people who are not peers, and the "Rt Hon" prefix and "PC" suffix for peers who are privy counsellors. Peers who are not privy counsellors are given the title "Rt Hon" only. There are various suggestions for how these prefixes and suffixes should be used.

{{rfcquote|text=
I am requesting comments on the proposal that we '''eliminate production codes''' from all lists of episodes, as well as [[Template:Episode table]], [[Template:Episode list]], and similar templates.

My reasons for this proposal are that:
# The vast majority are unsourced or poorly sourced (often model sheets from Tumblr)
# They add little information and are arguably fancruft
# They are common magnets for editing disputes and sneaky vandalism

Episode number of airdate should be enough information for the tables. Order can be determined per series if there are large differences between DVD orders and airdates.

The only value to them that I am aware of is that they may indicate that episodes were aired in a different order than intended by the writers. This is often trivial and any non-trivial instances could easily by mentioned and sourced in a note either in the plot summary or as a footnote.

I have no problem with well-sourced production codes on individual episode articles as this seems like a more appropriate place for such detailed information. But on a list of episodes it seems to cause more problems than the information added warrants. 

I chose an RFC for this discussion because there have been past discussions on this issue with few comments and no real outcomes. Please see [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Television/Episode_lists/Archive_1#I.27m_interested|2006]], [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Television/Archive_11#Request_for_Comments:_Production_codes|2009]], [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Television/Archive_15#What_is_the_correct_way_to_order_episodes.3F|2012]], [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Television/Archive_16#DVD_order_or_broadcast_order.3F|2012 (detailed discussion of issue)]], [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Television/Archive_18#Production_Code|2014]], and [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Television/Archive_20#Production_codes_and_A.2FB_carts|2015]] for past discussions of production codes on this project's talk page.

'''Summary (see version 1 for further text and references)'''



'''Prosection'''
Kosovo prosecution claims that Muhaxheri has traveled to Syria at two occasions between 2012- 2013 in a group of individuals from Kosovo, many of the members have been pointed out as students of imams at a mosque in Kosovo.The Kosovo prosecution have requested and been granted an international warrant for Muhaxheri’s arrest based on his affiliation with the group, which is affiliated  with Islamic State based on textmessages between Muhaxheri, an imam and other indicted members. The textmessages that Muhaxheri has obtained from the imam and other members include instructions related to recruitment, such as escorting recruited members between Syria and Turkey. The Kosovo prosecution has said that Muhaxheri didn’t participate in the fighting with the other indicted members of the group. Muhaxheri was last reported to be in Syria on 5 Oktober 2013, based on textmessages

'''Media coverage'''
There are media reports have claimed that  Muhaxheri appears in the following videos and footage; IS –propagandafilm Clanging of the Swords IV, an RPG – video, on beheading footage from Syria, a video from Iraq. 
There are media reports that have claimed that Muhaxheri has been killed in Syria and Iraq at three different occasions between 2014-2015. These reports have been denounced in other media reports that have claimed that publicized images and comments at IS militant Facebook accounts disconfirm  the reports of Muhaxheri’ s death.
In 2015 there are several media reports about Muhaxheri’s whereabouts that have been denounced by authorities; in November - December 2015 Muhaxheri was reported to be in Macedonia. This was denounced by Macedonian police department. In November 2015 Muhaxheri was  reported to be in Kacanik, Kosovo, the report was  denounced by Kosovo authorities. In December 2015 Muhaxheri was reported to be paralyzed in Syria, and later in December 2015 Muhaxheri was reported not to be paralyzed and to be in ar – Rutbah Iraq , on Muhaxheri was reported to be in Albania, this was denounced by an  Albanian International Affairs analyst due to unverifiabillity. 

'''Forensic and analyst opinions'''
The forensic anlazysts  of the published videos and footage alleged to be of Lavdrim Muhaxheri are not convinced that the footage is of the same individual and when and where the footage is taken. 

On IS –propagandafilm Clanging of the Swords IV;
According to Ebi Spahiu, a researcher at the Albanian Institute of International Affairs(AIIS);"he [Muhaxheri] would have come out with a stronger message".[1]

On RGP video
Researcher Ebi Spahiu stated that Muhaxheri was in the video but questioned whether it was new footage that proved he was still alive; "The media in Kosovo and Albania are treating it as a new video without considering that it may be old [footage]". Foreign policy analyst Adrian Shtuni stated that it was possible that the video was new footage, or at least newer than August 2014 but questioned whether Muhaxheri was in the video;"In a photograph of Muhaxheri taken around the summer of 2014, the militant appears to be heavier than he is in the video, although his outfit is the same", suggesting that the RPG video was taken at a different time than the two photographs. Foreign policy analyst Shtuni further claimed that it was possible that Muhaxheri was emulating other senior IS figures.

''' Only validated claims '''

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_oldest_living_people&direction=next&oldid=700309171 This version] which is "This is a partial list of the oldest living people in the world in ordinal ranks. In this table, a supercentenarian is considered 'verified' if his or her claim has been validated by an international body that specifically deals in longevity research, such as the Gerontology Research Group (GRG) or Guinness World Records (GWR)."

* '''Support''' This version reflects the scientific consensus on the subject - that claims are subject to error and exaggeration and therefore a competent body is needed to assess claims. Most major news organizations routinely defer to the expertise of GRG or GWR in claims of extreme age, and wikipedia should reflect that general consensus in the need for longevity arbiters. Though, I would slightly amend the "partial list" phrase as though there are likely more unverified or unverifiable super-c's out there, we, by definition, don't know that for a fact. Reinstating the "unverified" lists would allow us to have a greater idea of other claims which may be true.

{{rfcquote|text=
The current chronology of the Bach Legacy section is arbitrarily organized by century markers like 1800, 1900, 2000, etc, rather than specific important dates directly relevant to the Bach Legacy section. Another RfC (see above on Talk page) has identified that the dates of 1788 (the death of Bach's son), and 1829 (the date of the Mendelssohn Bach revival) are of heightened importance to understanding the Bach Legacy as a whole. Bach's two composer sons (died 1784 and 1788, respectively) inherited many of Bach composition manuscripts and influenced their dispostion during their lives. Mendelssohn worked extensively to revive Bach's reputation between 1824-1829 with the revived performance of Bach's Matthew Passion in Germany in 1829. The dates in the Bach chronology should reflect this in a new and enhanced outline covering first, '''1750-1788''', followed by '''1789-1829''', followed by '''1830-1899''', leaving the rest of the section unchanged at this time. This RfC is to determine SUPPORT or OPPOSE for the enhanced specification of the important dates over and against the use of arbitrary century markers currently used in the Bach Legacy section.

I think there needs to be a discussion of Sanders' Party affiliation/s - BOTH in the infobox AND in its own section on the page.  For my entire life I have known one thing about Sanders - that he was neither a Democrat nor a Republican.  It was like knowing that Buchanan was a bachelor, or that Andy Jackson  served a giant cheese. It made them unique.  Except, the Jackson cheese was not as trivial as it sounds.  His administration truly did mark a transition from a government by "gentlemen of property and standing", to a more egalitarian government. We need to address this extremely distinctive and meaningful fact about Sanders: That was and is famous for being neither [[Republican Party (United States)|elephant]] nor [[Democratic Party (United States)|donkey]].  The page needs to put the facts about his unique attitude towards Party in a subsection and on the infobox.  What was he and when? And why?

I had [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eminem&type=revision&diff=700993825&oldid=700811385 recently added] about the death of Dawn Scott to the article. Dawn Scott is the biological mother of Eminem's adopted daughter Alaina and&nbsp;twin sister of his ex-wife Kim Scott. However [[User:SNUGGUMS|SNUGGUMS]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eminem&type=revision&diff=700994316&oldid=700993825 removed] the details of her death. I readded it but he removed them again. His reasons for not letting it add are that she isn't her family member as Eminem had divorced with Kim, details of her death are [[WP:UNDUE]] or [[WP:Out of scope]] of the article and this is not an article about Dawn or Kim or Scott family. Also he [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eminem&action=historysubmit&type=revision&diff=701014024&oldid=701008999 removed] about a sub-section of [[Proof (rapper)|Proof's]] death of the the "''Personal life''" section from the article even though the section was more about how Eminem responded to his death. I however [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eminem&type=revision&diff=701021640&oldid=701014024 reverted] his edit. Proof was the best friend of Eminem and associated musically as he was member of his musical group [[D12]]. SNUGGUMS has cited some of the same reasons for removing the section of his death: it is WP:Out of scope or WP:UNDUE, this isn't an article about Proof and the info about songs of Eminem's album [[Recovery (album)|Recovery]] dedicated to Proof should be in the article about that album.

My reason for keeping the details about both Proof and Dawn's deaths are that I think their deaths are relevant and DUE to the article as both of them were closely related to Eminem, the subject of this article and I don't think there's any policy that at least explicitly prohibits from adding about their deaths. Dawn Scott is especially very closely related as I've already said she us biological mother of Eminem's daughter and ex-sister-in-law. Also I &nbsp;had cited another reason to SNUGGUMS about adding details of her death, I gave the example of [[El Chapo]] article where deaths and arrests of El Chapo's family members and ex-wives are mentioned. So atleast Dawn's death should be mentioned. However SNUGGUMS refuses this saying we don't have to go by what's done [[WP:OTHERSTUFF|OTHERSTUFF]].&nbsp;Proof was best friend and member of Eminem's music group D12. Additionally as I already said the sub-section about Proof's death was more about Eminem's reaction to Proof's death.&nbsp;

This issue seems complex to me and the discussion between us two basically kept going back-and-forth over the same thing. I offered to reduce the amount of details to just one sentence "On January 19, 2016, Dawn died, apparently due to heroin overdose". However he didn't agree. The discussion has ended up going nowhere and that's why I've created this RfC in order to receive input of others including those who haven't been involved with others. Additionally, I think this might also serve as an example if what to do in similar cases.&nbsp;

So my question is: Do you think the deaths of Proof and Dawn Scott should be added to the article? And if yes then in what form? [[User:KahnJohn27|KahnJohn27]] ([[User talk:KahnJohn27|talk]]) 03:46, 22 January 2016 (UTC)}}

Try [https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#q=%22Kingdom+of+Germany%22+-Wikipedia&es_th=1 a google search] and you will find no such thing as the article describes. In all fairness, it's a rough (mis)translation of a specific German term (Deutsches Reich) with heavy implications. What takes the cake here is that even long after this period of time the English still referred to the entire Mid-Germanic region as ''Dutch''. I simply can't comprehend why this article name would suit it. The only real obstable to a consensus so far is that we can not decide on ''what'' to move/rename it to. I'm asking you (and others) to reach out here, since plenty of people on the talk page have long voiced their disagreement with the current status of the article. You two have been active in these discussions and so invariably play a part in what comes next. I have no doubt of your good intentions and commitment, which is why I'm reopening this with a Request for Consensus on how to deal with the matter at hand. 

I don't want to be the one to keep pushing this though. If nothing comes from it or consensus decides that it should remain the same, I will of course agree with this decision.

These simple and short ten phrases / measures succinctly summarize the aim of the manifesto's effort ( they are listed in the above section ).  They speak volumes in addressing the changes Marx and Engels wrote about ( the rest of the manifesto ).  The general public would best be served if allowed to read and identify these ten measures. This would assist the reader in understanding what Marx and Engel's aims / demands were.  Since the Wikipedia effort is providing an encyclopedia where the common person can find decent citations and concise information when conducting research for school, work, or the like, not having these ten measures included in the article would be a disservice to those searching Wikipedia for highlighted and summarized information.  When has any manifesto not been known to have a list of demands?  Not having the list of demands of the Communist Manifesto in this wiki entry neuters the article.

Regarding the manner in which this objection is being voiced:

I've found the manner in which I've been treated quite discouraging in furthering the wiki effort.  Two individuals are calling "consensus" when only three ( myself and them two ) have opined recently on this particular matter and article.  Not sure if one of them is a WP:SOCK, but further discussion may make this entire matter clearer and show motive in obstructing the simple addition of the ten measures.  I expressed my concern when my edit was removed several months ago when one of these individuals took it upon themselves to conduct an entire rewrite of the article.  I didn't object and let them continue without issue.  That effort did affect the [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest90/The_Communist_Manifesto statistics of readership] of the article.  I applaud the effort of this person in editing, but again, not including what is so simple and concise as those ten measures is like not including water when trying to make soup.  They initially desired to assist in including the ten measures, then chose against them, which I found quite odd.  One could review the editing history and the dialogue at my talk page for clarity and the dubiousness of the editor who rewrote the entire article and now acts as the article's co-manager. --[[User:HafizHanif|HafizHanif]] ([[User talk:HafizHanif|talk]]) 00:15, 25 January 2016 (UTC)}}

Which of the sources should be kept and which should be removed? A detailed analysis of sources and the concerns about them is found one section above. Given below is a short summary of each source and the concern raised.
# The first source "The Prophet Jesus (as) and Hazrat Mahdi (as) Will Come This Century" is by [[Adnan Oktar]] who is a conspiracy theorist. [[WP:FRINGE]] is violated here. 
# There are two references to the Quran. the article is about [Hadith]. Including the references to Quran is [[WP:COATRACK]]. 
# Source four is Sahih Bukhari, one quote is enough more than that and [[WP:QUOTEFARM]]. 
# Source five is a hate book written by Akhtar Rizvi. The proof that this book is a hate book is that it uses the hate word "[[Qadiani]]". A simple analogy is that a book which uses the word "Dirty niggers" throughout the book "will not" be used as a scholarly source in African American Articles. Same is the case with books using "Kike" not being used as scholarly sources in "Semitic" articles. 
# Sources six and Seven are once again Primary sources from which information has been cherry picked through [[WP:OR]].
# Source number eight is "Nuzool Isa Ibn Maryam Akhir al-Zaman" written by Jalaluddin al-Suyuti. It is un available on the internet in any form. When we try to search for this book in google books, to see if "any OTHER scholar" has quoted Suyuti's opinion, we come up empty handed. Only "Religious Polemics in Context: Papers Presented to the Second International Conference of the Leiden Institute for the Study of Religions (Lisor) Held at Leiden, 27-28 April, 2000" and "THE BIOGRAPHIES OF THE ELITE LIVES OF THE SCHOLARS, IMAMS & HADITH MASTERS: Biographies of The Imams & Scholars" have the name of this book in their index, and both of them refrain from giving any quotes etc. So even though this "may well" be a reliable book, up till now I am having trouble ascertaining whether it is even a real book or not. 
# Source number ten is "Ibn Hajar al-Haytami's book Al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah", which discusses how a marriage was arranged and discusses Ahl-al-Bayat, and nothing is said about Jesus.
# Source number 11 is "Fara'id al-Simtayn. p. 43". Imam Mahdi and Jesus have not been mentioned by this source. So again, source misrepresentation, or something like that.
# Source 12 is again the same dubious book by Suyuti under a different name. Already discussed.
# The last source is a "Shi'ite encyclopedia"; a HUGE book and no reference has been given.
Those who comment here can format their comments into two options if they like. They can use a bullet list to make two sentences like this
* "source 1,2,3,4.....is bad and should be removed"
* "source 5,6,7,8.....is good and should be kept"

* Both Neo-Nazism and the belief in white supremacy are well established Far-right ideologies <ref>Hilliard, Robert L. and Michael C.

* In terms of [[WP:NPOV]], 'Far-right' sounds more balanced and even-sided
* The sites author's opinion should be taken into account to maintain [[WP:DUE]]. Even the reliable sources cited above in point 2 attest to the current designations of 'Neo-Nazi' and 'White supremacy' as being Far-right.

The following wording [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Images&oldid=699751350#Size used to be in the guideline]: "As a general rule, images should not be set to a larger fixed size than the 220px default (users can adjust this in their [[m:Help:Preferences|preferences]]). If an exception to the general rule is warranted, forcing an image size to be either larger or smaller than the 220px default is done by placing a parameter in the image coding." The guideline currently looks like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Images&oldid=701619620#Size this]. Above on the guideline talk page, there is concern that the "As a general rule" wording is limited, and that we shouldn't assume that all readers keep their default size set at 220px; assuming such can lead people to use improper image settings. There is also concern that there are few cases where an image needs to be above the 220px setting, and that the 220px rule has kept unreasonable image sizes at bay and settled disputes over image size for years.

Two issues:
# The article was recently edited to include these fully referenced claims: (I) "''which, according to Mitsubishi's general manager of the medium class car project group, Shunji Takeshita, was built as a "luxury car [...] designed to compete with BMW''" and (II) "[engine noise] ''was described by automotive journalists as being "reminiscent of a BMW six''".
# For over 1 year, fully referenced [[Recommended retail price]]s for each series and each model of this car, have been part of this article.

FIRST ISSUE: Given a [[WP:POV]] dispute started by a user finding the above claims "false" (note: there are no third-party sources supporting this), are these fully referenced quotations unfit for inclusion, considering the many direct supportive sources found? See above discussion [[Talk:Mitsubishi Magna#Comparisons]] above for more.

SECOND ISSUE: The same user disputing the above referenced quotations has attempted to delete prices (in what can only be described as an act of retaliation given he contributed to this information being left in the article). Noting that WP:NOPRICES is not definitive, this car is no longer for sale new (eliminating any misuse of Wiki as a sales catalogue), the prices are all fully referenced to the same point in time (i.e. at the launch of each new series), and price was a key factor of the success and failure of this car, should they be deleted?

The UK study which is being pushed by [[User:Mattnad|Mattnad]] is a somewhat flimsy primary source that may not belong at all. But I'm also a bit perturbed by edits like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Campus_sexual_assault&diff=701631860&oldid=701631693 this] by [[User:Nblund|Nblund]]. While the edit summary is accurate in a sense - this particular source doesn't make the specific claim that the BJS criteria were narrower - we also all know this claim to be true, and it can be sourced elsewhere. On both sides, there is an effort to control almost every word in this article, which is going to preclude it from being developed. I would suggest you stop arguing over these small issues and instead open a (hopefully friendlier) discussion about how to significantly restructure the article. It needs work one way or another. --[[User:Sammy1339|Sammy1339]] ([[User talk:Sammy1339|talk]]) 04:47, 27 January 2016 (UTC)}}

This Rfc asks how the article should describe the Maya calendar, in terms of the number of ''piktun'' cycles in a '. 
Should we 
:A. Describe the Maya calendar system as uniformly using 20 piktuns per kalabtun? (Sources include: )
or should we 
:B. Mention that some inscriptions use seem to 13 baktuns in the previous piktun and 13 piktuns in the current kalabtun? (Sources for this include Sharer & Traxler, Van Stone 2011, Stuart 2011 (also [https://decipherment.wordpress.com/category/reflections/], Carter 2014)

;Survey:
*'''B'''. Three major specialist sources describe how some inscriptions clock over after 13 piktuns (at least forthe piktun from 3114BCE to 2012CE). Van Stone specifically argues that this is because of local variation in how the larger cycles are counted.  That is enough that we need to include this view. Describing it as if the Maya uniformly used the base 20 clock for the higher order cycles would be false. I propose using the following text to describe this:" The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 or 13 bak'tuns. Specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the bak'tun cycle that ended in 3114 BCE had only 13 bak'tuns, which means that the current piktun cycle is exceptional in containing 13 + 20 bak'tun. There may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed."[[User:Maunus|·maunus]] · [[User talk:Maunus|snunɐɯ·]] 18:31, 8 February 2016 (UTC)}}

I assert that the article [[Climate change denial]] is unencyclopedic and does not comply with [[WP:NPOV]]. Reasons:
* The style of writing is not neutral but is condemnatory of climate change sceptics/deniers
* There is POV-pushing, e.g. in the use of "unwarranted doubt" rather than just "doubt"
* The section "Pseudoscience" is inappropriate. It is not pseudoscience to hold an opinion on climate change which differs from the majority opinion

I suggest two possible remedies:
* The article should be re-written in a neutral style, or
* The title should be changed to [[Criticism of climate change denial]]

<s>I also criticise the fact that [[Climate change skeptics]] redirects here. Climate change skepticism is not the same as climate change denial, although this article pushes the POV that they are the same.</s>

In June 2014, Poroshenko signed the [[Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement]], which his predecessor, Yanukovych, had rejected in 2013. The Euromaidan and Yanukovych's removal from power led to [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]] starting in February 2014. Following this unrest, Russia conducted a [[2014–16 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|covert invasion]] of parts of Ukraine, sparking an [[2014 Crimean crisis|international crisis]]. In March 2014, the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] held the [[Crimean status referendum, 2014|referendum]], thereby declaring its [[secession]] from Ukraine, and shortly thereafter signed a treaty to [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|join]] the Russian Federation. The annexation was [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation#International response|not recognized]] by the overwhelming majority of the world community and provoked the imposition on 17 March 2014 of the [[International sanctions during the 2013–15 Ukrainian crisis#First round of sanctions|first round of sanctions]] against Russia by Canada, the United States, and the European Union.

The term "Cold War II" gained currency and relevance as tensions between Russia and the West escalated throughout the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]] followed by the [[2014–16 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|Russian military intervention]] and especially the downing of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] in July 2014. By August 2014, both sides had implemented economic, financial, and diplomatic sanctions upon each other: virtually all Western countries, led by the US and EU, imposed [[International sanctions during the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|restrictive measures]] on Russia; the latter reciprocally introduced retaliatory [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis#Sanctions by Russia|measures]].

{{rfcquote|text=
Hello, it is as a consequence of a derailed discussion on a talk page [[Talk:Mitsubishi Magna|this one]], that I commence this one here. In a nutshell (I hope):
* WP:NOPRICES or WP:PRICES is clearly neither definitive nor compulsory, in omitting price information from articles
* the present case arises because, in an Australian car article ([[Mitsubishi Magna]]), for some 1.5 years, [[recommended retail price]]s have been included without any opposition by any of the regular editors 
* opposition has been (improperly?) raised of late by a regular editor (OSX) only in retaliation for a separate discussion not going his way (which involved both me and him)
* in 2014, a discussion went against the inclusion of prices, with reasons including: (i) a lack of reference; (ii) price flactuations over time; (iii) the potential for car dealers to spam; (iv) the potential misuse of the article as a sales catalogue (note: the originating RfC has also been compromised by an offensive participant to the 2014 discussion, Mr.choppers, claiming that it was all done and dusted 2 years ago)
* to address, or in answer to, the above valid points: (i) full reliable external references have been found and included, from Australian car magazines; (ii) the prices included, for each series of the car over a period of 10 years, have strictly been only those listed at the time of launch of each car thus eliminating the issue of price flactuations; (iii) the car has out of production for over 10 years; (iv) by being only prices at launch, it ensures that "special" or "discounted" prices are not included... and a car is not an insignificant household good, which renders its price a key factor for consumers
* the launch prices have been included in such a manner that they do not render the article illegible (prices are included in brackets, against each model variant, where these are listed)
* other car articles (and I am aware this is not a basis for inclusion) also contain prices, without reason or context, let alone full references unlike the above case
* in the above case, prices were a determinative factor of the car's success (in terms of competition and winning Car of the Year awards) and failure against other Australian-made cars
* in the manner in which prices have been included, it is possible (for those who may choose to do so), to carry out trend analysis of new car prices in Australia, which, in the case of this car, spans a period of 20 years (such analysis may seem trivial and I do not profess the following being a determinative crucial point, however, come 2017, no more Australian cars will be manufactured, so prices have the potential of being an important historical fact in future relative to imports)
** ''AN ALTERNATIVE'': could the fully referenced prices perhaps instead exist in a table, which lists all series, models and variants of this car, if it is a case of readibility?
All in all, is opposition to the inclusion of prices in the above case, proper? Does the non-descriptive and non-compulsory WP:PRICES really give basis to delete this carefully searched and referenced information? As mentioned, I am forcedly resorting to starting this discussion here, because of the derailed RfC on the relevant Talk Page (and other retaliatory actions against me, including being subject of a sockpuppet investigation, which I have no qualms highlighting, unlike the opposing editor's practice of oppressing and/or contorting facts—as I have complained about in the sockpuppet report—and deleting warnings from his Talk Page).<br>
'''Above all''', I raise this discussion here with a view to encourage/seek more more definitive and/or prescriptive guidance on this WP... it isn't helpful that it is so inconclusive, causing the above type of arguments to arise.<br>
I am '''not''' requesting or suggesting that this Policy be varied to allow prices for ''all'' consumer goods, but a car is typically a major purchase for most people, with price being a key factor in consumer choice. I argue for price inclusion, only if fully referenced and as it applied at a specific point in time (the most practical, if not logical, being the time of launch of the car or last listed price).

{{rfcquote|text=
 How should the second paragraph of the overview section begin [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mainline421/sandbox#Overview in this draft] begin? Disagreement has arisen over how this paragraph should begin, this mainly stems from whether or not Grand Theft Auto V was developed in parallel for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] as it is argued is confirmed by these articles: [http://www.pcgamer.com/gta-5-bug-log-lists-pc-version-and-directx-11-effects/ GTA 5 bug log lists PC version and DirectX 11 effects], [http://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-talk-4k-pc-performance-and-more/ Rockstar talk 4K, PC performance and more], and [http://www.gamesradar.com/gta-5-pc-why-evidence-too-strong-ignore/ GTA 5 on PC - why the evidence is too strong to ignore] however, it is also argued that this quote from the second article contradicts this:
{{Talkquote|"While we started development of the PC version quite early, we decided to focus the bulk of our attention on the PS3 and XB360 versions first in order to push that as far as we possibly could before turning our attention to the PS4 and Xbox One versions, and then using the shared architecture underpinning the new consoles to help ourselves ramp up into the PC version and push the game as far as we possibly could knowing we would have the opportunity to make the game look and feel better than it ever has."}}
while it has also been said that this merely a matter of interpretation and that this does not contradict the other sources. The reliance of a leaked bug log for the claims that development was in parallel have been criticized as well, this been contended with the fact that the bug log is present on the PlayStation 3 disk, and it has therefore been argued it is part of the product and not leaked or rumour. All the above articles meet [[WP:VG/RS]] and two are from the same publication. [[WP:Synthesis]] and [[WP:Inaccuracy]] are both relevant here. 23:33, 30 January 2016 (UTC)}}

I really think we need more input regarding the images used on this article.

I propose that we pool our collective opinions here and put things to a vote. Since there are 2 questionable images I'll split this into 2 subsections.

'''Artist's impression in the infobox'''

[[File:Planet-Nine-in-Outer-Space-artistic-depiction.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's impression of Planet Nine]]
The infobox currently shows an artist's impression of Planet Nine (right), which appears to be closely based on [http://www.caltech.edu/news/caltech-researchers-find-evidence-real-ninth-planet-49523 an image released by Caltech credited to R. Hurt (IPAC)]. While artist's impressions may help to grab the reader's attention I do not think that it's becoming of an encyclopedia to reproduce them here and I propose that it be removed, or at the very least removed from the infobox. The only information it conveys are ''basic assumptions'', which could easily mislead the reader. [https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@21.854703,-45.6376436,22971116m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en A view of the Earth can be found here] in which the planet's size and distance from the Sun is similarly ''not'' conveyed. Please bear in mind that even if you don't find the picture misleading, others undoubtedly will.

The Wikipedia Manual of Style does not currently have any solid guidelines on how to capitalise trademarks with multiple capital letters, such as 'tvOS', 'watchOS', 'webOS', etc. The only guidelines I can find currently are: 
* [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Use commonly recognizable names]],
* [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Article titles]],
* [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Trademarks]] and
* [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Trademarks#Trademarks that begin with a lowercase letter]].
Editors are divided over which forms to use, e.g. whether to use 'exampleOS', 'ExampleOS' or 'EXAMPLEOS' and whether to use different forms at the start of sentences, etc. The Manual of Style needs some guideline to use because the current ones do not give a rule to follow for this situation.

This article covers the period from 1972 onward when the ATP came into existence however the men's tour was officially known as the [[Grand Prix tennis circuit]] from 1970 to 1989. The original discussion about this articles scope was outlined by [[User:Wolbo]] in which he stated. "At the time I was not greatly enthusiastic about the creation of [[Tennis records of the Open Era – men's singles]] given the apparent overlap with this article and the additional effort required to maintain both. Now that both articles exist side-by-side and share about 90% of the content it makes sense to evaluate the scope of these articles. The scope of this article, especially with its current name, is not always clear and can be interpreted to mean either:

A. all records since the creation of the ATP (September 1972)<br>
B. all records which are recognized and listed by the ATP (on their website)<br> 
C. all records since the creation of the ATP Tour (in 1990) or the ATP World Tour (in 2009)<br> 

This ambiguity leads to occasional confusion and edit warring. The current situation, with one article covering the entire history and two others covering almost the same period, seems less than optimal. My proposal is therefore to change the content scope of this article from the creation of the ATP (1972) to the creation of the ATP Tour (1990). That gives a better coverage of the milestones in tennis history, solves the issue of the 90% duplication between this and the Open Era article and better matches the content with the title of the article. Thoughts?"

The previous discussion above opened this debate further with some editors including myself preferring that we just have the 2 articles Overall & Open Era and that we should delete it, it was also suggested by [[User:Fyunck(click)|Fyunck(click)]] that we should move this discussion into a formal RFC with three available options below which I am doing now.

*''Option 1''. Do we delete this article and re-direct to the Open Era article?
*''Option 2''. Do we keep this article as it is now? 
*''Option 3''. Do we change this article to reflect only records from 1990 when the ATP took full control of the men's tour?

Editors are most welcome to add your comments, thoughts, etc, below.--[[User:Navops47|Navops47]] ([[User talk:Navops47|talk]]) 05:48, 1 February 2016 (UTC)}}

As this is essentially a ''de facto'' guideline at this point, I think it's high time that this essay be promoted to an ''actual'' guideline.

 Is the EGS Accreditation section accurate? Does the information are correct and/or updated?

'''RfC: Is the U.S. accreditation section accurate?'''

I am writing here since it is my understandig that the user "JzG, Guy" is the only administrator who is able to make decision. Even if there is another administrator with a different point of view [Vanjagenjie}, "JzG/Guy"makes the final decision whether or not edit the EGS article
"JzG/Guy" does not like the Maltese accreditation, so it would be not possible to have the EGS article amendend. By doing so, "JzG/Only/Guy" editor has never explained the reason of denying our request. I am asking that other administrators can check what I am writing and I politely request an explanation.
Therefore, below I am posting again the contributions with verifiable and external sources any administrator can check. 

European Accreditation
European Graduate School is a European School headquartered in Switzerland. European Graduate School received the E.U. Accreditation on April 27, 2015 through the Maltese Accreditaion Body "National Commission for Further and Higher Education". The Maltese Accreditation Office recently updated their website with a list of accredited school, and between these appears the European Graduate School <ref></ref>http://ncfhe.gov.mt/en/register/Pages/list_hei.aspx<ref></ref>. Not stating anything about the E.U. Accreditation is misleading because Wikipedia readers think E.U. has no accreditation even if I provided sources of the Accrediation.

U.S. Accreditation
Michigan State info: Why does Wikipedia EGS article host on a misleading external link which does not have anything to do with the Michigan Department of Education? The current information is based on a link of Arab British Accademy for Higher Education and does not come from Michigan Department of Education. In particular, by reading the EGS Wikipedia article: "The State of Michigan Civil Service Commission states that degrees from the EGS "will not be accepted...to satisfy educational requirements indicated on job specifications". This statement is based on the external link website </ref>[http://www.abahe.co.uk/Non-accreditedSchools_78090_7.pdf)</ref>; [1] that does not have anything to do with the Michigan state.
 Indeed, the official Michigan state website is the following:<ref></ref> http://www.michigan.gov/documents/Non-accreditedSchools_78090_7.pdf<ref></ref>. By clicking on that link, does not appear the EGS as a non-accredited school. Therefore, I politely request to remove X (The State of Michigan Civil Service Commission states that degrees from the EGS "will not be accepted...to satisfy educational requirements indicated on job specifications").

Moreover, I request that the current "Accreditation in the United States" would be also removed for the following reasons. European Graduate School is a European University (and not a U.S. School). In other words, applicant students are aware they are applying to a European University, therefore is not correct that the majority of information contained on Wikipedia is based on a U.S. Accreditation. Lastly, I do not find correct the the article contain the following information: "degrees from the EGS are not currently recognized by many state education authorities in the United States". In fact, only two States appear to not recognize them, meanwhile no reference to the remaining 48 States is made. I assume that 48 States recognize EGS degrees so it is not correct that information. Therefore, please change X ["degrees from the EGS are not currently recognized by many state education authorities in the United States"] in Y [48 States recognize EGS degrees and two States (Texas and Maine) don't.]
In addition, in other U.S. states EGS graduates are being hired for U.S. faculty positions (for example, at Georgetown University,[4] New York University,[5] and Princeton University[6][7]). Therefore, why Wikipedia article host only the negative statements and not the positive ones?

Lastly, I provided that the Maine and Texas information are outdated. In fact,  the U.S. Council for Higher Education Accreditation                         <ref></ref> http://www.cheainternational.org/intdb/display1.asp?ID=c95<ref></ref> recognizes the Maltese Accreditation Body (National Commission for Further and Higher Education). The Maltese Accreditation Institute provided Licence no. 2015-007 to European Graduate School on April 27, 2015. As I wrote before, National Commission for Further and Higher Education updated their website confirming that EGS is an accredited school <ref></ref>http://ncfhe.gov.mt/en/register/Pages/list_hei.aspx<ref></ref> . The License is valid from April 2015 to April 2020. 

Can a different administrator (from JzG/Only/Guy) update the EGS with these accurate information?  [[User:Claudioalv|Claudioalv]] ([[User talk:Claudioalv|talk]]) 01:55, 1 March 2016 (UTC)}}

The [[:Category:Wikipedia information pages|information page]] '''[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Motorcycling/Conventions]]''' has been evolving over the last few years, as our version of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Automobiles/Conventions]]. We filched a lot of material from that page, though the motorcycling conventions are not subordinate to the automobile conventions. We often follow their example because wider consensus exists, and some consistency between related projects is desirable. It has been a while since these conventions were discussed, and they have changed in the meantime with little discussion. They have never been officially adopted by the Motorcycling Project, though they have been listed on [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Motorcycling]] with no objections.

The goals of this RfC are to:

#Ensure the conventions to not overstep any Wikipedia-wide [[WP:Policies and guidelines|Policies and guidelines]].
#Remove any parts which lack consensus.
#Correct any egregious errors or contradictions.
#Receive input from non-motorcycling readers and editors, to help make the topic and project accessible to all
#Establish consensus for the conventions.

Beyond that, all changes and commentary are welcome. It might be best to hold off any major deletions until a lot of participants have had a chance to see the starting version of the conventions page, instead using inline notes, highlights, and discussion here on this talk page. --[[User:Dennis Bratland|Dennis Bratland]] ([[User talk:Dennis Bratland|talk]]) 20:13, 1 February 2016 (UTC)}}

I have closed [[Talk:Veganism/Archive 14#RfC: Should the definition at the start of the lead of Veganism contain the wording, 'and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals'?|the RfC]] on whether the first sentence should include, change, or remove "the [[commodity status of animals]]", with a consensus to perform the following: <blockquote>edit the first sentence to mention the main belief ("philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals" or similar) of ethical veganism as a belief that is not always, but ''may'' be followed by vegans.</blockquote> There is no consensus to change "the commodity status of animals" itself. This means that the first sentence should not include the rejection of the commodity status of animals as a belief of veganism generally, but as a belief that ''may'' also be adopted by vegans. The justification for this close is covered in the RfC's closing statement.

The following modifications to the first sentence were proposed in the RfC. This second RfC will decide how the first sentence should be modified. Any proposals for an alternative wording should be started in a separate level-3 section and include "the [[commodity status of animals]]" or similar as there is no consensus to change this.

==RfC: Is administrator "Guy/Only/Jzg" the final say what happen in the article?==This is case where only few administrator have an interest in an article, but with this request for comment process I hope to bring in outside people to review and make a decision. JzG behaviour is malicious because he has never explained why does not recognize Malta Accreditation. Being a smaller country than others is not a good reason. He already blocked me and now he is attempting to block me again so he can reach his goal. By reading on the EGS talk page two different administrator have written that "we probably do have to add the Malta accreditation/licensing"@DGG and "We have some reliable sources that say that this school is properly accredited in Malta by the National Commission for Further and Higher Education of Malta"  @Vanjagenije . One administrator yesterday edited the article but JzG reverted that edit. I am asking: does JzG make the final decision? If yes, why?
JzG's behaviour is also malicious because he tried to hide by changing name to the Michigan misleading link (see Notes and References n. 14 EGS article). It seems that it is a real link (a real world) but is not, because is an outdated pdf that does not have anything to do with the Michigan Education Board [is a pdf written by the Arab British Academy for Higher Education that definitely does not reflect the official Michigan statement]. In fact, the Michigan official website with reference to Non-accredited School is the following  <ref></ref>http://www.michigan.gov/documents/Non-accreditedSchools_78090_7.pdf<ref></ref> and EGS is not in the list. This should be easy to verify. I posted this link 13 times and no one, so far, has given me an explanation why WIkipedia is hosting a false information [i.e.Michigan does not recognize EGS degree] based on an outdated link.[[User:Claudioalv|Claudioalv]] ([[User talk:Claudioalv|talk]]) 04:37, 3 March 2016 (UTC)}}

The article has multiple issues, among them the lack of explaining the actual conspiracy theories in the background section. The background section begins with "9/11 conspiracy theorists reject some or all of the following facts about the 9/11 attacks." References, either do not mention conspiracy theories, or make misleading claims such as, "..fires caused the collapse of the Twin Towers and the destruction and damage of other buildings..."

*Suggestion ('''A'''): Update the current background section in accordance with [http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-14665953 this BBC article] (2011),  for the five most prominent 9/11 conspiracy theories. 
*Suggestion ('''B'''): In particular add the following content based on an edit for two of the BBC's listed conspiracies, ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=9/11_conspiracy_theories&diff=prev&oldid=702995732 read the edit here]).

There is dispute over whether to use [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Child_abuse&diff=703160442&oldid=703158955 this] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Child_abuse&diff=703166525&oldid=703164032 this] definition for the [[WP:Lead sentence]] of the [[Child abuse]] article. The latter version is the broader definition. One concern is that since reliable sources say that the definition of child abuse is not always clear, the lead should use the broader wording, especially if it establishes what the words ''abuse'' and ''maltreatment'' mean according to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC). The other concern is that the broader definition is less commonly used, since unintentional harm of a child is often not termed ''child abuse''; because of this, it is therefore misleading to state "any" or "all forms" of harm to a child, especially for things like "neglect" or "exploitation"; the [[Child neglect]] article, for example, makes it very clear that child neglect is commonly difficult to define. 

If receiving this message from the RfC page, see [[Talk:Child abuse#Lead section: WHO definition of child maltreatment]] for more discussion on how to define the lead. Also, [[WP:Med]] and [[WP:Law]] will be alerted to this RfC. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 22:50, 3 February 2016 (UTC)}}

I believe that it is well sourced that the outcome of this war was '''indecisive''' and not a "Maratha Victory" as claimed here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_Anglo-Maratha_War&oldid=701588356]. This claim of an indecisive outcome is proven by a variety of academic sources, including the following <ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=cdXnVOKKkssC&pg=PA226|title=The First Anglo-Maratha War, 1774-1783: A Military Study of Major Battles|page=226|author=M. R. Kantak|others= quote: "Inspite of British superiority in the military science, the British troops could not force a decisive win over the Maratha troops in the First Anglo-Maratha War. The ultimate result of the War  showed that the two sides remained evenly balanced."}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=cYoHOqC7Yx4C&pg=PA290|others=quote: "First Anglo-Maratha War...The war ends inconclusively."|title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture|author=John Bowman|page=290|publisher=Columbia University Press}}</ref>. I think that attempts to try and portray this war as a "Maratha Victory" is indicative of a bias, which violates [[WP:NPOV]]. Even the main painting of a British soldier allegedly submitting to the Marathas is unsourced and does not appear to have a historical basis. I would like additional involvement from other users in regards to this matter. [[User:Xtremedood|Xtremedood]] ([[User talk:Xtremedood|talk]]) 06:30, 7 February 2016 (UTC)}}

'''Survey'''

* '''Support''' in general. This does not mean we should avoid links to full PD movies or other media, whether at Commons, Internet Archive, or hosted elsewhere (as long as it's PD), just that when you are putting these within the prose of the article, they do not help to condense the summary approach we are supposed to be giving the reader. Short clips or screencaps of relevant sections embedded in the prose are infinitely more helpful from an encyclopedic standpoint to showcase something that is of discussion in the neighboring prose rather than the full work and telling the reader to go find it themselves. We don't need to include full classic novels to understand those novels from an encyclopedic viewpoint, so the same logic applies with video and audio. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 15:24, 7 February 2016 (UTC)}}

 Should the following categories be included in this BIO article? [[:Category:Stabbing attacks in 2015]]

*[[:Category:Islamic terrorism in Germany]]

'''Oppose inclusion''' I do not believe these categories are appropriate for a biography in any conceivable way. For example [[WP:COPDEF]] states "Categorise by characteristics of the person, not characteristics of the article: The most common mistake of this type is adding an article to Category:Biography. That category may legitimately contain articles about biographical films or biographical books, but should not contain articles about individual people. The article is a biography; the person is not" - Yousef was a terrorist. He was not a terrorist incident. He was not a crime.

The movie ''Debbie Does Dallas'' is in the public domain (according to Commons, although FWIW that's apparently disputed by some parties, but as a general rule we follow what Commons says). So it makes sense to include or link to the film in some way. Two ways have been suggested, and it's been rather contentious with no consensus reached. Asking for more input what say you, fellow editors?
*'''Include it as a click-to-play thumbnail in the body of the article''', below the infobox? or
*'''Include it as a link in the External Links section''', presumably in a Commons icon but with the legend "Full film available at Wikimedia Commons" (with "Full Film" clickable) rather than (or in addition to) the less clear default "Wikimedia Commons has media related to Debbie Does Dallas" (but don't get hung up on the details, please).

One of the sources says "Combine that with a strong work ethic and a love of the game that Archie had instilled in his boys and it's no wonder that Peyton and Eli have been so successful. The result is a legacy that's rarely matched in professional sports.

Should all of the subcategories of the [[Wikipedia:Good articles/all|Wikipedia:Good articles]] page continue to be placed on the [[Wikipedia:Good article nominations]] page?

The list of good articles (GA) is organized onto ''topics'' (or ''pages''; there are 15 topics/pages), ''subtopics'' (there are 37 subtopics across the topics). From the beginning, all of the topics and subtopics on the good articles page have also all been placed onto the good article nominations (GAN) page.<ref>There are also ''sub-subtopics'' (there are 444 sub-subtopics across the subtopics). ''Sub-subtopics'' from the GA page have never been placed onto the GAN page, except in helpful explanation sentences found under each subtopic. This RfC is not concerned about sub-subtopics.</ref><ref>Naturally, in an ever-expanding encyclopedia, editors improve the categorization on the GA page: never adding topics but occasionally adding subtopics. The last time this was done was to add an additional subtopic ("Classical compositions") to the Music topic and to add seven additional subtopics ("Armies and military units", "Battles, exercises, and conflicts", "Military aircraft", "Military decorations and memorials", "Military people", "Warships and naval units", "Weapons, equipment, and buildings") to the Warfare topic. (The time before that, three years ago in November 2012, the topic name "Theatre, film and drama" was changed to "Media and drama" and the subtopics "Film" and "Television" were created; see [[Wikipedia talk:Good article nominations/Archive 18#Changing Section Headings]].)</ref> 

I propose we add the additional subtopic ("Classical compositions") to the Music topic and to add seven additional subtopics ("Armies and military units", "Battles, exercises, and conflicts", "Military aircraft", "Military decorations and memorials", "Military people", "Warships and naval units", "Weapons, equipment, and buildings") to the Warfare topic. To do so involves editing the GAN page to add the new subtopics and enhancing Legobot to use the new subtopics.<ref>This has not been done; note that the GAN page must be edited first before the enhancements may be added, as the bot inserts articles between specially placed comments on the GAN page.</ref>

Of course, the developer/operator of Legobot, {{u|Legoktm}}, who took over this responsibility in 2012, is invited to this discussion and their input is critical. It appears we haven't yet had a subtopic change under Legoktm's watch.

There are a few other things to consider. First: The GAN page looks odd with empty subtopics and empty subtopics could confuse people, although of course it's only temporary, so we should probably not add them until Legobot is nearly ready to use them. Second: Remember that a subtopic on the GAN page is also a queue in which we wait for our GAN to be reviewed; more subtopics may mean it is not as far from the bottom of the queue to the top. And last: Maybe some other GA/GAN subtopics should also be divided into additional subtopics; for example the "Sports and recreation" subtopic is quite large on the GAN page.<ref>Although new subtopic names are not immediately obvious here.</ref>

Thank-you for your comments. My thanks to {{u|BlueMoonset}} who helped research this. Best, [[User:Prhartcom|Prhartcom]] ([[User talk:Prhartcom|talk]]) 17:08, 8 March 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Following [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)/Archive_119#Jr._comma_RfC:_Survey an RfC in April 2015], the text of [[MOS:JR]] was amended to allow both the use and omission of commas around the suffix "Jr" in names. In other words, as long as an article is internally consistent, one is allowed to write either {{xt|Martin Luther King, Jr,}} or {{xt|Martin Luther King Jr}}. In recent discussions of the matter, it has come to light that the form with the commas, whilst traditional, has lost ground to the form without them. If one reads [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Comma#In_English:_Commas_used_with_.22Jr.5B..5D.22_and_.22Sr.5B..5D.22 a survey of style guides] done by [[User:SMcCandlish|SMcCandlish]], it becomes apparent that eliminating the comma not only has advantages in terms of readability, but it also is nearly universally recommended across the various varieties of English. Eliminating the comma improves prose readability, fulfilling [[MOS:COMMA]]'s recommendation to reduce comma usage, where it is possible. In addition, it eliminates the necessity of the matching comma, which is often omitted in error or otherwise misused.

Based on these findings, should [[MOS:JR]] be amended to prefer the use of the suffix "Jr" without commas? [[User:RGloucester|<span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:12pt;color:#000000">RGloucester </span>]] — [[User talk:RGloucester|☎]] 23:34, 25 February 2016 (UTC)}}

Articles often mention both medial reports from 29 July 2014 about Muhahxeri allegedy appearing on beheading footage from Syria [17] and a warrant from Court of Ferizaj and Interpol from the 6 September 2014 in the same articles but they don’t claim that the warrant is issued for the alleged beheading footage [17]; ‘The demand comes from the Basic Court of Ferizaj, which has issued a warrant for Muhaxheri after he is accused of terrorism and organized groups to go to Syria and Iraq’ [17]'. Published court records on 15 January 2016 only mention text messages as evidence for recruitment.[65] The question is about formulation of medial claims in regard to NPOV; avoid stating opinions as facts; shouldn't ‘On 29 July 2014 Muhaxheri uploaded photos to a Facebook page where he is seen beheading an unidentified young man in Syria.’(1/2) (2/3) be stated as 'According to Balkan media, on 29 July 2014 an individual posted two (2) images to a Facebook page under the pseudonym "Lavdrim Muhaxheri" ( it's questioned which published  footage is of Muhaxheri [11]) that, to some extent, give the impression of a man having beheaded an unidentified young man.' or something to the effect of a neutral statement where it's mentioned who's claiming it?

{{rfcquote|text=
This article was created in 2011 as an expansion of a section in the [[Government of Australia]] article. It has been much discussed and modified in that time, but has remained essentially stable for several years. Summarising the lede:
* the term head of state does not appear in the Australian constitution (or any other law)
* there is a disagreement among Australians centred on the question of whether the monarch or the governor-general is the country's head of state
* the disagreement has involved viceroys, politicians, legal scholars, and the media
* the question was most prominently debated in the context of an Australian republic at the Australian Constitutional Convention 1998
* it has recurrently been discussed in publications before and since.

Two new editors have raised questions about the validity of the article, and several options have emerged. How should we proceed?
# The article is rubbish. The Queen is the Australian head of state and any statements to the contrary are errors or misunderstandings. The article should be removed entirely.
# The article is mostly rubbish. A few prominent Australians and sections of the media claim the Governor-General is the head of state, but this is a fringe theory. The article should be merged into other articles.
# The article is well sourced and describes the situation accurately. It is notable because few (if any) other nations dispute the identity of their head of state. It should be retained and improved.

There is an ongoing dispute regarding the [[Campus_sexual_assault#Criticism|criticisms]] subsection. Specifically, editors have objected to the bulleted list section that details several lawsuits filed by men who were expelled from universities after being accused of sexual assault. The most recent discussion is [[Talk:Campus_sexual_assault#Undue_weight_for_criticism_section|here]]. Generally, the suggested changes are to either:

*1. Leave the bulleted list unchanged, and add a roughly equal amount of detail on cases filed against universities by accusers. 

or 

*2. Offer a couple of short summary statements that address the recent increase in lawsuits filed by students accused of sexual assault without focusing on specific cases.

When a song or album is the only song or album to have a standalone article on Wikipedia, but other songs or albums of the same name are listed on the disambiguation page for that name per [[MOS:DABMENTION]], should the article title of the notable song or album include the artist name?

Some songs and albums are the only song or album with its name to meet notability guidelines and have an article on Wikipedia, but other songs or albums of the same name are listed on the disambiguation page per [[MOS:DABMENTION]]. The current situation on the inclusion of artist names in article titles is inconsistent. A few examples of no artist names in article titles include [[Umbrella (song)]], [[Pillowtalk (song)]], and [[Anti (album)]]; they are the only songs and albums of their names to be notable enough for a standalone article on Wikipedia, although there are other non-notable songs/albums of the same name listed at [[Umbrella (disambiguation)#Songs]], [[Pillow talk (disambiguation)#Songs]], and [[Anti#Music]] respectively. A few examples of artist names in article titles include [[Chandelier (Sia song)]], [[Blackstar (David Bowie song)]], and [[Title (Meghan Trainor album)]]; similarly, they are the only songs and albums of their names to be notable enough for a standalone article on Wikipedia, but [[Chandelier (song)]], [[Blackstar (song)]] and [[Title (album)]] redirect to disambiguation pages, where other non-notable songs/albums of the same name are listed. [[WP:PRECISION]] states {{tq|According to the above-mentioned precision criterion, when a more detailed title is necessary to distinguish an article topic from another, use only as much additional detail as necessary.}} [[WP:NCM]] states {{tq|Use further disambiguation only when needed (for example X (American band), X (Australian band)).}} The dispute arises on whether non-notable songs and albums that lack standalone articles can be considered "article topics". I think we can all agree that the current inconsistency is not ideal, and I am starting a request for comment for a result that should apply to most usual cases.

Does the [[WP:TITLECHANGES]] section on changing the national variety of English in an article title need to be clarified?

Article titles which have to choose between two national varieties of English (Yogurt vs. Yoghurt, Color vs. Colour, Humor vs. Humour, and so on) are often subject to perennial move discussions which are often lengthy, contentious, and brutal wastes of time as they rarely resolve anything. Our manual of style currently says, "{{green|If an article title has been stable for a long time, and there is no good reason to change it, it should not be changed. [...] If it has never been stable, or it has been unstable for a long time, and no consensus can be reached on what the title should be, default to the title used by the first major contributor after the article ceased to be a stub.}}" I think the point that needs to be clarified is what makes a title "stable": editors disagree whether stable means "not moved" versus "no move discussions". Or perhaps "default to the title used by the first major contributor..." is being interpreted as a "good reason to change it", absent any other reasons.

The problem this creates is being exemplified in yet another move discussion at [[Talk:Humour]] where it's been suggested that the title is unstable because of the repeated move discussions over a long period (the page has actually been at this title since 13 May 2007), and as a result it's being argued that the "default to the title used by the first major contributor after the article ceased to be a stub" applies, and then there is debate about which version is the first non-stub version. I would like to see that confusion resolved one way or the other, but I'm not sure how to do it, and I don't know what the original intent was.

I suggest these changes (marked up as best I could):
*to [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Retaining the existing variety]]: {{green|When no English variety has been established and discussion cannot resolve the issue, the variety used in the first <s>non-stub</s> revision is considered the default. If no English variety was used consistently, the tie is broken by the first <s>post-stub</s> contributor to introduce text written in a particular English variety.}}
*to [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Considering title changes]]: {{green|If an article title has <s>been stable</s><u>not been changed</u> for a long time, and there is no <s>good</s><u>other</u> reason to change it, it should not be changed. [...] If <s>it has never been stable, or it has been unstable for a long time, and<s> no consensus can be reached on what the title should be, <s>default to the title used by the first major contributor after the article ceased to be a stub</s>the tie is broken by the first contributor to introduce test written in a particular English variety.}}

I think these changes will help to resolve conflicts about which variety to use, so that we don't go back and forth endlessly and have editors repeatedly bringing up the same move proposals over and over again.

A previous RfC had 3 supporting editors for changing the current arbitrary century marker dates to important benchmark dates in the Bach Legacy time-line, with 2 editors opposed which resulted in deadlock. The current chronology of the Bach Legacy section is arbitrarily organized by century markers like 1800, 1900, 2000, etc, rather than specific important dates directly relevant to the Bach Legacy section. Another RfC (see above on Talk page) has identified 1829 (the date of the Mendelssohn Bach revival) as being of heightened importance to understanding the Bach Legacy as a whole. Mendelssohn worked extensively to revive Bach's reputation between 1824-1829 with the revived performance of Bach's Matthew Passion in Germany in 1829. The dates in the Bach chronology should reflect this in a new and enhanced outline covering first, '''1750-1829''', followed by '''1830-1899''', etc, leaving the rest of the section unchanged at this time. This RfC is to determine SUPPORT or OPPOSE for the enhanced specification of the benchmark dates over and against the use of arbitrary century markers currently used in the Bach Legacy section.

{{rfcquote|text=
There was an incident with a trainer while Manning was at college that was settled but came back to the public light due to the mention of [[Peyton Manning]] in other negative history that I'm going to explain later. My idea is to add this lines to the UT Volunteers section in Manning's BLP:

{{quote|On 2016, the incident was back at the public light after the [[New York Daily News]] published an article recounting Naughright’s original complaint and 74 pages of Polk County Circuit Court documents related to that case.<ref name=king_02132016>{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Shaun|title=KING: Peyton Manning’s squeaky-clean image was built on lies, as detailed in explosive court documents showing ugly smear campaign against his alleged sex assault victim|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/king-peyton-manning-squeaky-clean-image-built-lies-article-1.2530395|accessdate=February 13, 2016|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=February 13, 2016}}</ref> Afterwards, a lawsuit against the University of Tennessee was filed alleging [[Title IX]] violations by the school with papers citing the incident with Naughright.<ref>http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2016/02/14/complete-coverage-university-tennessee-sex-assault-lawsuit/80380324</ref> Subsequently, the University filed a motion to strike any reference of Manning from the lawsuit.<ref>www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2016/02/23/tennessee-wants-manning-reference-removed-from-lawsuit/80828682</ref>}}

Then, there's a mention of Manning in an [[Al Jazeera English]] documentary explaining the possibility of Manning using PED substances, and as he spoke with ESPN about that, I had the idea of adding a couple of lines surrounding that interview about the documentary and Manning's mention on his 2015 BLP section:

{{quote|On December 27, 2015, a day before Broncos' game versus the [[Cincinati Bengals]], [[Al Jazeera America]] released documentary called ''"[[Al Jazeera English#The Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers|The Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers]]"'' which investigated professional athletes' potential use of [[Performance-enhancing drugs]] (PEDs) naming [[Peyton Manning]] and other prominent athletes as having received drugs from Charles Sly, a pharmacist who had worked at the Guyer Anti-Aging Clinic in Indianapolis during the fall of 2011.<ref name="aljazeera1">{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/12/dark-side-secrets-sports-dopers-151227133355144.html |title=The dark side: The secret world of sports doping |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2015-12-29}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14441114/documentary-links-peyton-manning-other-pro-athletes-use-peds |title=Documentary links Peyton Manning, other pro athletes to use of PEDs |website=Espn.go.com |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2015-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/12/29/al-jazeera-reporter-stresses-that-no-allegation-is-being-made-against-peyton-manning/ |title=Al Jazeera reporter stresses that no allegation is being made against Peyton Manning &#124; ProFootballTalk |website=Profootballtalk.nbcsports.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-08}}</ref> Manning told [[ESPN]]'s [[Lisa Salters]] about the reports on an interview, calling them "completely fabricated" and "garbage", and he also expressed his anger about his wife, Ashley, mentioned in the documentary.<ref name="denvbron">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Transcript-Peyton-Manning-interviews-with-ESPNs-Lisa-Salters/f07ef954-bada-42fc-ab64-f9f38dc9fb49 |title=Transcript: Peyton Manning interviews with ESPN's Lisa Salters |website=Denverbroncos.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-29}}</ref> As [[Al Jazeera America#Reactions to "The Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers" documentary|several reactions about the topic were stated]], Manning took response and hired former [[Presidency of George W.

These are short lines, are conclusive and express important facts without compromise the [[WP:NPOV]] of the article, as the mentioned facts not only involved Manning, but also other institutions and third persons. I'm trying to do my best. [[User:Leo Bonilla|Leo Bonilla]] ([[User talk:Leo Bonilla|talk]]) 22:00, 27 March 2016 (UTC)}}

It has come to my attention that certain articles, such as the article for [[Roger Craig Smith]], have been edited to include information on an animated series called "Galaxy World of Alisa". It's apparently based on a Russian children's book character, but a few Google searches don't yield too much. I don't exactly know what to do for this, and I would appreciate it if someone were to help me look into this further so I can figure out whether or not to delete the information from these articles.

[[WP:RS#Vendor and e-commerce sources]] says: ''Although the content guidelines for External links prohibits linking to "Individual web pages that primarily exist to sell products or services," inline citations may be allowed to e-commerce pages such as that of a book on a bookseller's page or an album on its streaming-music page, in order to verify such things as titles and running times. Journalistic and academic sources are preferable, however, and e-commerce links should be replaced with non-commercial reliable sources if available.''

{{User|Bgwhite}}, an editor whose work I have seen and respect, has been removing supporting references to Amazon that provide reference support for information such as book titles and publication dates. Examples from my watchlist are:
* {{la|Magic Tree House (series)}}; and
* {{la|Laura Schwendinger}}.  

The references were already present in the Magic Tree House article; I didn't add them. I did add the reference to the Schwendinger article; the material it supports was already there, but unreferenced, and on a quick Google search, I could find no better reference.

I've pointed out this guideline, and that sources should be replaced; but can still be used until replaced.

BGwhite's approach is to simply delete the references, with comments such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magic_Tree_House_%28series%29&type=revision&diff=707771965&oldid=707771819 "Amazon IS NOT a valid source. Period."] I disagree; I think it is acceptable edit behavior to either ''replace'' the Amazon cite with a better cite, or add {{tl|better source}} to flag it for another editor, but not to delete the cite and leave it unreferenced.

On his [[User talk:Bgwhite#Amazon as a RS|talk page]], BGwhite says "It says when a better source is available, use it instead of the commercial site." I'm good with that, but these edits are not substituting a better source; they are not using a better source.  They are simply removing the existing source.

I realize for the Magic Tree House article, I could probably google-search and come up with something (and indeed, for the book series, one thing I'd like to do when I have the time is to add an ISBN-based footnote for each book); but I'm thinking of the bigger picture here, and the pattern of deleting sources and leaving material unsourced as a result.

All this basically calls into question this guideline. Should Amazon cites be deleted without replacing with a better site? Should this guideline be updated? [[User:TJRC|TJRC]] ([[User talk:TJRC|talk]]) 19:02, 1 March 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
What guidance should [[WP:Disambiguation]] give for article titles that do not result in a conflict between two or more articles, but which are not inherently unambiguous to a general audience?

'''Background:
*[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Disambiguation&diff=665798731&oldid=663463105 This content] regarding titles that inherently lack precision was added to [[WP:DAB]] on June 6, 2015, by {{u|SMcCandlish}}, consisting of a paragraph under "Is there a Primary Topic?", an example under "Deciding to disambiguate", and a summary sentence in the lead paragraph: "Disambiguation may also be applied to a title that inherently lacks precision and would be likely to confuse readers if it is not clarified, even it does not presently result in a titling conflict between two or more articles." SMcCandlish posted a rationale of this addition to [[Wikipedia_talk:Disambiguation/Archive_43#Disambiguating_WP:PRECISION_failures|the talk page]], which received no replies.
*On July 16, 2015, {{u|Red Slash}} [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Disambiguation&diff=671784557&oldid=671612130 removed] the main paragraph, with the comment "How does this have anything at all to do with disambiguation?".  A [[Wikipedia_talk:Disambiguation/Archive_43#WP:PRECISIONDAB|talk page discussion]] between Red Slash and {{u|Francis Schonken}} discussed this removal.
*On July 28, 2015, Red Slash [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Disambiguation&diff=673503177&oldid=673300432 removed] the example under "Deciding to disambiguate". On August 6, this example was restored by SMcCandlish and again removed by Red Slash, then, on August 7,  restored by SMCandlish, removed by Francis Schonken, again restored by SMcCandlish, and again removed by Francis Schonken. An [[Wikipedia_talk:Disambiguation/Archive_44#Natural_and_clarifying_disambiguation|RFC]] on the content from that time doesn't appear to have been officially closed, but by my count has three editors in support of the principle of "disambiguation for clarification" and three opposed.
*In February 2016, the lead sentence (the only remaining portion of the content originally added June 6) was removed by {{u|Born2cycle}}, restored by by SMcCandlish, removed by {{u|BD2412}}, restored by {{u|Dicklyon}}, removed by {{u|Calidum}}, restored by {{u|Tony1}}, removed by Calidum, restored by Tony1, removed by Calidum, and restored by {{u|Bagumba}} who locked the page for edit warring. A [[Wikipedia_talk:Disambiguation/Archive_45#Unsupported_change_reverted|talk page]] discussion did not result in any clear consensus.
*On March 23, the lead sentence was removed by {{u|Dohn joe}}, restored by {{u|In ictu oculi}}, removed by Dohn joe, and restored by SMcCandlish. A further [[Wikipedia_talk:Disambiguation#Restored_content_on_precision_cut_from_lead|talk page discussion]] ensued. 
*With respect to the participants on both sides, the discussion of the proposed guideline so far has generated more heat than light. I'm hoping a straightforward and (pardon the pun) unambiguous RFC can resolve the issue somewhat permanently and put an end to the disruptions to [[WP:D]]. Two of the talk page discussions have proposed taking this to RFC, but don't seem to have been able to reach agreement even on what an RFC should look like. As I have not, to my recollection, participated in the dispute, I have done my best to frame it neutrally and been so bold as to just go ahead and post it here. Please let me know if I have missed anything salient in the above summary.--[[User:Trystan|Trystan]] ([[User talk:Trystan|talk]]) 02:34, 25 March 2016 (UTC)}}

This statement in the EGS article is not correct: "The State of Michigan Civil Service Commission states that degrees from the EGS "will not be accepted...to satisfy educational requirements indicated on job specifications". In fact, this information relies on a false (false because is not official) and outdated (it dates back to 2009) external link. In particular, the following and current link http://www.abahe.co.uk/Non-accreditedSchools_78090_7.pdf comes from the Arab British Accademy for Higher Education and does not reflect the Michigan Civil Service Commission official statement. In other words, the current information is based on the external link that does not have anything to do with the Michigan State. On the contrary, the official and updated (2016) Michigan state website is the following: http://www.michigan.gov/documents/Non-accreditedSchools_78090_7.pdf . By clicking on that link, does not appear the EGS as a non-accredited school. Moreover, I note that it sets forth: "Degrees issued by foreign colleges and universities may be accepted if an applicant or employee presents evidence to demonstrate that the degree represents education equivalent to similar studies at an accredited university". 
So, my question for this RfC is: Should we take off the information about the Michigan Civil Service Commission to the EGS article, Accreditation Section?. [[User:Claudioalv|Claudioalv]] ([[User talk:Claudioalv|talk]]) 03:30, 13 March 2016 (UTC)}}

We have some reliable sources that say that this school is properly accredited in [[Malta]] by the National Commission for Further and Higher Education of Malta (NCFHE). Here they are:

There have been several suggestions made towards rewriting the lead (among other parts of the article) to more accurately portray the individual and to reflect a more NPOV as per WP:BLP. Among others, at issue is "An article in Time described the medical and scientific communities' opinion of him as ranging from dismissive to damning; criticism includes statements that his approach could lure sick people away from effective treatments." One argument is this does not accurately reflect the source and that any positive portions of the article have been rejected. The other is that the positive proposed edits are not supported, that the Time source is essential and the article is fine as it is.  Do the sources support the changes? Is the lead balanced/representative of a NPOV? Relevant sections : [[Talk:Deepak_Chopra#Lead_Section]] and [[Talk:Deepak_Chopra#Lead_issues.2Frevisions]].

Similarly to what happens with e.g. newspapers ([[Correction (newspaper)]]), we could make a note of factual errors we featured on the Main Page in either the same spot (so a DYK error gets noted in the DYK section of the main page) or in a separate section on the Main Page. This should only be done for facts, not for grammatical errors, capitalization changes and the like. This was recently done a few times, but met with mixed reactions.

I have recently removed, for the third time, the section on recently deceased people which has included those who were on the living list who died within the last year.

The only comment on the re-adding of this material is that "This is very useful and has nothing to do with a memorial. It makes it easy to keep up with who died recently. Quite essential for a site of living people." I don't see that this is sufficient justification for inclusion.

Should we list the [[WP:INUNIVERSE|in-universe]] (fictional) former names, aliases, middle names only ever mentioned rarely or in non-canon material, and other name variants of fictional characters, in the leads of these characters' articles?  Example:

* '''Jeanne Mary (Garcia) Deaux''' is a character on the soap opera ''Last Days of Our Lives'' ...
* '''Jeanne Mary Deaux''' (formerly '''Jeanne Smith''', born '''Juanita Maria Garcia''') is a character on the soap opera ''Last Days of Our Lives'' ...
* '''The Superfudge''' (in day-to-day life the reclusive businessman '''Robert O'Blivion''', a carefully maintained alias of '''Petrov Vlaidimir Zorkov III''') is a superhero in ...

A recent discussion of this matter, with editwarring and [[WP:ANI]] drama surrounding it, can be found at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Soap Operas#Middle names, maiden names, married names, birth names, etc...]]. This relates closely to previous discussions like [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics/Archive 48#Lead section and character names]], about changing comics character leads (for articles at the name of the superhero/supervillain) to begin with the fictional "real" name of the character in everyday "life", as if these were articles on real people.

An excessive genuine example of the issue is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nikki_Newman&oldid=664256108 here] ("Nicole "Nikki" Newman (née Reed; previously Foster, Bancroft, DiSalvo, Abbott, Landers, Chow, and Sharpe) is a fictional character ..."), but is not representative of typical cases, and the RfC question is more general; i.e. it should be taken as using the first of the above examples as typical. It should also be noted that the simple formula "Superman is a fictional superhero.... As Clark Kent, he is a journalist by day...", or "Iron Man (Tony Stark) is a fictional superhero...", is typical in superhero/villain articles, and many other fiction (novel, TV series, etc.) articles on fictional characters with aliases, and this RfC is not challenging that. There are more complex cases as at [[Spider-Man]], where the "real" (fictional) person who is the superhero has changed over time; these generally approach this matter with prose explanations, not long strings of alternative names, and is often handled outside the lead, as at [[The Shadow]]. <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 21:02, 26 March 2016 (UTC)}}

'''Proposal: Should we remove from {{tlx|Infobox person}} the {{para|religion}} parameter (and the associated {{para|denomination}} one)?'''<br />
* Religion would be covered in the main article body, with context and sources (if included as relevant at all, per consensus at the article).
* Permit inclusion in individual articles' infoboxes (through the template's ability to accept custom parameters) if directly tied to the person's notability, per consensus at the article.
* Permit inclusion in derived, more specific infoboxes that genuinely need it for all cases, such as one for religious leaders.

'''Rationale''': This would be consistent with our treatment of sexual orientation and various other things we don't include in infoboxes that are matters which may be nuanced, complex, and frequently controversial.  The availability of a parameter encourages editors to fill it, whether they have consensus to do so or not, regardless of instructions in template documentation to gain consensus first; new and anon IP editors generally do not read documentation, they simply see a "missing" parameter at article B that they saw at article A and add it.

While written for [[WP:Category|categories]], the concerns of [[WP:CAT/R]] and [[WP:NONDEF]] may be [[WP:Common sense|logically applicable]] here, since the context-free data in infoboxes serves a categorization/labeling purpose, not an expository one; their reasoning is frequently applied to [[WP:NAVBOX|navbox]] templates, at least informally. So is that of the [[WP:BLPCAT]] policy, which explicitly covers them, and lists.  Per [[WP:NOTBUREAUCRACY]], [[WP:LAWYER]], and [[WP:GAMING]], if the community's consensus is to avoid certain kinds of arbitrary, contentious, or factually questionable labelling, this consensus must not be evaded by moving the label to a different spot on the page in a different wrapper.

{{block indent|1=<small>'''Procedural notes''': I'm listing this at VP because RfCs at the infobox template talk pages tend to overrepresent the views of infobox template editors and those who argue about these templates frequently, and I think this deserves – requires – broader input, considering reader needs, encyclopedic purpose, editorial community strife levels, etc.  I think matters like this also very directly relate to the resistance against including infoboxes in entire categories of biographical articles, but I'm not going to leave pointers to this RfC at every wikiproject on the system; VPPOL exists for a reason.  PS: If anyone really wants to, the places to look for any previous RfCs or other discussions on this parameter would be the archives of this page, of [[Template talk:Infobox person]], [[Template talk:Infobox]], [[Wikipedia talk:Biographies of living persons]], [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Biography]], [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Infoboxes]], and [[Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)]] (all of which have already been notified of the current discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#RfC: Ethnicity in Infoboxes|the similar one]] on the {{para|ethnicity}} parameter.</small>}}

Previous section header was and is now currently "[[Dr. Luke#Lawsuit with Kesha|§Lawsuit with Kesha]]", which was established in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Luke&action=historysubmit&type=revision&diff=647413350&oldid=646925142 an edit] by {{U|SNUGGUMS}} over a year ago per discussion on the talk page (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ADr._Luke&type=revision&diff=647413562&oldid=647373287]). {{U|TripleVenom}} strongly feels (and acts in good faith) that the section header should reflect the sexual assault allegations made against Dr. Luke by Kesha. They have changed the section header to "Sexual Assault Allegations" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Luke&diff=703315774&oldid=703299343], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Luke&type=revision&diff=703320987&oldid=703316592]) and "Sexual assault allegations and lawsuit" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Luke&diff=709407479&oldid=709306067], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Luke&diff=709416699&oldid=709407889]). Others, myself included, have objected to the change. This dispute started during early February 2016 when media attention and social media campaigns around a judge's ruling prompted some editors to target this page.  This has been the subject of dispute on the talk page; see [[#Sexual Assault Allegations]], [[#Semi-protected edit request on 20 February 2016]]. Discussion, however, has been rather sparse and between a handful of editors so I am initiating this RfC for further input and to hopefully gain consensus on the issue. <small>I am INVOLVED but have tried to summarize the dispute as neutrally as possible. Other parties are welcome to clarify or dispute my summary.</small> [[User:EvergreenFir|'''<span style="color:#8b00ff;">Eve</span><span style="color:#6528c2;">rgr</span><span style="color:#3f5184;">een</span><span style="color:#197947;">Fir</span>''']] [[User talk:EvergreenFir|(talk)]] <small>Please &#123;&#123;[[Template:re|re]]&#125;&#125;</small> 22:29, 21 March 2016 (UTC)}}

Should [[George Washington#Legacy]] be merged into this article, with only a short [[WP:SUMMARY|summary]] left behind? Rationale: This legacy article exists for a reason, and the main GW article is swimming in "legacy" trivia, with disputes on the talk page there about adding more of it, distracting from the purpose of improving the historical bio article.

After the merger, a section that is a comprehensive treatment of GW in fiction should be written (in prose, not as a list), for things like filmic portrayals, use of GW as a major video game character (often as in an anhistorical way), etc., or people will never strop trying to insert bullet items about video games, comics, etc., into the main article, which is about the actual historical figure. <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 22:27, 14 March 2016 (UTC)}}

There have been numerous reports about the aftermath of the doping violations in this event from multiple runners. Some of the trials have concluded, while some are in progress. The key distinction for medals and finishers, though, comes from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Alptekin's positive test was in May 2013 and her ban announced in August 2015; however, the IOC has made no specific announcement and the distribution of medals hasn't changed. 

So what's the WP policy (and ideally with some precedent) on listing Alptekin, Kareiva, and Kostetskaya as DSQ in the finals? At the minimum, there's a problem with conflicting sources. [[User:Irregulargalaxies|Irregulargalaxies]] ([[User talk:Irregulargalaxies|talk]]) 19:25, 8 March 2016 (UTC)}}

Blocking is very important in cases where the user indulge in persistent personal attacks, vandalism, copyright issues, etc. However, as identified by the community numerous times, newcomers are often not totally aware of the policies and guidelines that are ought to be followed on Wikipedia. Even after repeated warnings, some new users try to contribute to Wikipedia in good faith and end up being blocked to prevent further disruption. They are even blocked from editing pages in their namespace.
I'd like to raise an idea here. What if perpetual disruptive editors were allowed to edit their user namespace, or, at least their Sandbox and possibly create draft articles, while gradually getting acquainted with the rules here. Editing their ''own'' namespace has little possibility to disrupt Wikipedia.

When the subject of an article is a film or video, and the full-length film or video is available on Commons, should it be general practice to:
::A. embed the full-length video,
::B. link to the full-length video's Commons page in the external links section, or
::C. neither embed nor link to the full-length video?

''Note: If there is consensus for (A) or (B) below, a follow up question will address the matter of exceptions. The most obvious open question regarding exceptions would be sexually explicit content, but there are others that have been raised (e.g. a limit on the duration of the video). Again, I think it would be most productive to address exceptions AFTER the close of this RfC, perhaps informed by concerns raised through discussion here.'' &mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> \\ 21:20, 11 March 2016 (UTC)}}

Many editors and readers, including a number on this talk page, have expressed concern that there is much unnecessary spoiling allowed on Wikipedia, and that this guideline is used as justification for spoiling any and everywhere; this is also despite the fact that the guideline currently states, '''"When including spoilers, editors should make sure that an ''encyclopedic purpose'' is being served."''' Like [[User:McGeddon|McGeddon]] noted, "it's probably worth clarifying the spoiler guideline to say which kinds of sections include spoilers and which shouldn't, to reflect how articles are generally being written. The article for [[The Sixth Sense]] does not give away its twist ending in the lede, or even directly state that there is one, but has no qualms about mentioning the ending in the Production section, since it's useful to the interested reader to share information about how the filmmakers approached it. The [[Breaking Bad]] [...] character descriptions [in the] [[Breaking_Bad#Cast_and_characters|overview cast list]] treads lightly and doesn't go much further than saying which seasons characters appeared in, while the full [[List of Breaking Bad characters]] article goes into great detail about each character's story arc, as this is the kind of thing somebody researching the show would want to know. Clearly there's some informal consensus that when writing articles that it's inappropriate to spoil plot elements in places where they aren't entirely necessary and might surprise the reader ('' 'make sure that an encyclopedic purpose is being served' '' is perhaps trying to say that), and I think this guideline could do with pinning that down." 

I concur with McGeddon, and propose that the "When including spoilers, editors should make sure that an ''encyclopedic purpose'' is being served." wording be changed to the following wording from [[WP:How to write a plot summary#Spoilers]]: {{tq|When summarizing a plot and choosing what details to include, editors should use discretion.  The advantages of exhaustive coverage of the work are in dynamic tension with the desire to preserve the artistic qualities of the work for readers.<ref>This standard parallels the dynamic tension between the policy that [[WP:NOTCENSORED|Wikipedia is not censored]], and the practice of not tolerating sensationalism or offensiveness for its own sake.</ref>  Wikipedia should contain potentially 'spoiling' detail where it substantially enhances the reader's understanding of the work and its impact but be omitted when it merely ruins the experience of the work of fiction for our readers.}} Or that we just use the second sentence. Or that we change the wording to something else that is clearer than the current guideline's wording, to indicate that it is not okay to spoil for spoiling's sake. A Proposals section is below for those who want to suggest alternative wording. And a Discussion section is below for whatever else. I will alert [[WP:TV]], [[WP:Film]], [[WP:Manual of Style]] and [[WP:Village pump (policy)]] to this discussion.

::: There isn't consensus concerning the following requested additions. We had one editor, [[User:Newtonlee|Newtonlee]]  accept the above changes; another, [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]], reject some while making others without waiting for consensus and not addressing several others except to say he'd change anything back that he didn't agree with. Here's a summary of the disagreement: 

::: 1. Whether Beepi's latest valuation should be included. [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]] included a new statement in the article that Beepi did not disclose their valuation, but then discredited a highly credible source, [[Forbes]], which actually reported the valuation. He is framing the company to look badly, as though what they did not reveal to a single magazine, on one occasion, is the relevant fact to the history section, instead of the actual valuation. <ref>{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Brian|title=The Hottest Start Ups of 2015|url=http://www.forbes.com/pictures/eimh45ehmdj/23-beepi/|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=17 December 2015}}</ref> The information he dismisses from Forbes as an unworthy "passing mention"  is actually the first fact on the page that names Beepi as a "Start Up of the Year" for 2015.  Forbes is known especially for ferreting out financial information, as in the [[Forbes 400]]. The statement that Beepi on one occasion didn't share its valuation should be deleted. It's an irrelevant fact to the company history section given the information was available from a Forbes article the previous month:

:::'''History:''' Delete "he did not disclose the valuation" and add, at end of the paragraph: "The company had a reported valuation of $564 million in December of 2015." <ref>{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Brian|title=The Hottest Start Ups of 2015|url=http://www.forbes.com/pictures/eimh45ehmdj/23-beepi/|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=17 December 2015}}</ref>

:::2. Whether the following sentence be added to History:

:::Beepi was named #23 on Forbes Magazine's list of the hottest start ups of 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Brian|title=The Hottest Start Ups of 2015|url=http://www.forbes.com/pictures/eimh45ehmdj/23-beepi/|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=17 December 2015}}</ref> It was also named #6 on Forbes Magazine's list of the hottest e-commerce start ups of 2015. <ref>{{cite news|last1=Mac|first1=Ryan|title=The Hottest E-Commerce Start Ups of 2015|url=http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdh45efdif/beepi/|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=30 December 2015}}</ref> 

:::[[User:Newtonlee|Newtonlee]] accepted the above request and [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]] rejected it without stating a reason. There are only three leading U.S. based business magazines: Forbes, Fortune and [[Bloomberg Business Week]]. Including that a company was named to a start up of the year list by any of these three sources does not seem to me to be promotional. When a big entertainment magazine named its top 25 young actors or Vanity Fair names the 50 top people in the "New Establishment", these are valid facts to include an article. This is analogous. I'm sure if any of these three sources named Beepi one of the worst start ups of the year, [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]] would want to include that. 

:::3. Whether to include all of the following additions, which were approved by [[User:Newtonlee|Newtonlee]], then not addressed by [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]], except to say he would remove anything from the article that he didn't like.  I'd rather achieve consensus here instead of having an edit war with the article:

:::'''History:''' Beepi's advisory board includes former U.S Treasury Secretary [[Larry Summers]] and former Obama deputy chief of staff [[Jim Messina]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Logan|first1=Bryan|title=This guy was so frustrated about buying a lemon that he vowed to revolutionize used cars|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-beepi-vroom-shift-buying-a-used-car-online-2016-1|accessdate=2 February 2016|publisher=Business Insider|date=1 February 2016}}</ref>

:::'''Services''', last sentence to first paragraph: Ally Financial offers financing directly to the Beepi marketplace.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dexheimer|first1=Elizabeth|title=Ally to Finance Used Cars Bought Online With Beepi Partnership|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-16/ally-to-finance-used-cars-bought-online-with-beepi-partnership|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=Boomberg Business|date=16 December 2015}}</ref>  

:::'''Services''': The New York Times reported that Beepi is among the small group of start ups, leveraging a large network of service providers, who use employees instead of independent contractors, in contrast to the Uber freelancer model. CEO [[Ale Resnik]] said it employs and trains its nation-wide network of auto inspectors because it increases their concern for customer service.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Farhad|first1=Manjoo|title=Start-Ups Finding the Best Employees Are Actually Employed|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/technology/personaltech/start-ups-finding-the-best-employees-are-actually-employed.html?_r=0|accessdate=10 September 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=24 June 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Hovercard (intermediate value theorem).png|thumb|right|Screenshot of Hovercards in use]]
[[mw:Beta Features/Hovercards|Hovercards]] is a feature currently in betatesting. You can test Hovercards by enabling it at [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures]]. When a user hovers over an article link a popup displays the lead text, and when available, the lead image of that article. The WMF has already developed the functionality required to exclude non-free images.

There is currently a proposal at [[WP:Village_pump_(proposals)#Proposal:_Enable_Hovercards_by_default|Village Pump: Enable Hovercards]] on whether we want the feature enabled by default. If you have an opinion on that question, please comment there. The discussion here should focus strictly on interpretation of non-free image policy.

Independent of whether a decision is made to enable Hovercards at this time, is it acceptable to include non-free images in Hovercards? The image would only appear when a user specifically requested a preview of the article containing the image. The image is displayed in a pop up mini-view of the article itself, along with some of the text from the article. It is clearly not being used for a "navigational" purpose. The image is arguably being viewed "in" a stubified version of the article itself, and it is arguably still serving the educational purpose of informing the reader about the topic and the related text that they are viewing in the mini-preview. See the image at right, the Hovercard (bottom center of image) is showing a preview of the [[intermediate value theorem]]. The image in this case is a free image, but it well illustrates how the presence of image in the preview is important to understanding the text.

Would Hovercard article-previews qualify as an acceptable place for non-free images to appear? [[User:Alsee|Alsee]] ([[User talk:Alsee|talk]]) 16:51, 16 March 2016 (UTC)}}

Ok. It's time to get this question settled once and for all, instead of arguing over it with no agreement as we have for the past few months. Greetings, soon to be very miserable uninvolved RfC commenters! This article is about a controversy that broke out over the twitter hashtag #Gamergate. A group of loosely associated people emerged on this hashtag and began coordinating all sorts of stuff. Most notably some pretty extreme online harassment was coordinated, but also email campaigns ostensibly about journalism ethics, campaigns against feminism, donations to video game fundraisers and the like.  The question you need to answer is this: should we refer to these people as part of a 'Gamergate movement?' Do the secondary sources support such a description? If not what would be more accurate to refer to this grouping as? [[User:Brustopher|Brustopher]] ([[User Talk:Brustopher|talk]]) 14:51, 16 March 2016 (UTC)}}

It might be [[WP:SYNTH]] in which case the sentence should be removed rather than removing the whole image. This image would serve the readers as it points out that people who are unlikely to sexually attack anyone may be required to register as a sex offender for youthful indiscretion.

The above discussion relates to the renaming of these articles.  Initially they were named "1 E0 m", "1 E1 m", "1 E2 m", etc.  These were very unhelpful names so the articles were moved to "1 metre", "10 metres", "100 metres", etc. (see [[#Proposal one]] above).  This was an improvement; however, it was not completely satisfactory because it left a couple of issues unresolved.
#This article is not ''about'' 1 metre.  Rather it's about things ranging in length from 1 to 10 metres.  The same goes for other articles in the series.
#These articles are generally quite short.  They'll get even shorter once some of the trivial stuff is removed (e.g. one metre is the length of a side of a one-cubic-metre cube). It would make more sense to merge them but threes (e.g. "1 metre", "10 metres" and "100 metres" to something like "Order of magnitude (1 to 1000 metres)").
Above I have [[#Proposal two|proposed]] a system consistent with other order of magnitude articles whereby these articles are merged in threes to "Order of magnitude (1 to 1000 metres)", "Order of magnitude (1 to 1000 kilometres)", "Order of magnitude (1 to 1000 millimetres)", etc.  The intent behind this RfC is to examine these questions and to come to some resolution.

Should the article include a background section that discusses previous boycotts by Palestinians?<br>
Here are a couple of sources that make the connection:
*[http://www.thenation.com/article/boycott-divestment-sanctions-movement/] - "﻿Boycotts are not a new tactic for Palestinians. As far back as the 1936–39 revolt against the British Mandate, Palestinians incorporated general strikes and boycotts into their struggle. "
*[https://books.google.com/books?id=uj-vAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT32] gives previous boycotts as historical background.
*[http://monthlyreview.org/2015/06/01/boycott-divestment-and-sanctions-at-ten-years/] "[Ramzi Baroud] reminds readers that Palestinian boycotts have a very long and important history—indeed, back to 1936. The current BDS campaign is an extension of earlier indigenous forms of struggle, and not merely a copy of the South African anti-apartheid movement."

Should the following epigraph, a long direct quote from Lee and Erdmann (1999), and content sourced to Schwartz (1990) and Danley (2005), be included ''in the section lede'' of the  "Safety issues, recalls, and lawsuits" section?

<blockquote>Scholarly work published in the decades after the Pinto’s release have offered summations of the general understanding of the Pinto and the controversy regarding the car's safety performance and risk of fire. Lee and Ermann summarized the popular yet largely erroneous understanding of the issues surrounding the Pinto and related fires.

<blockquote>Conventional wisdom holds that Ford Motor Company decided to rush the Pinto into production in 1970 to compete with compact foreign imports, despite internal pre-production tests that showed gas tank ruptures in low-speed rear-end collisions would produce deadly fires. This decision purportedly derived from an infamous seven-page cost-benefit analysis (the "Grush/Saunby Report" [1973]) that valued human lies at $200,000. Settling burn victims’ lawsuits would have cost $49.5 million, far less than the $137 million needed to make minor corrections. According to this account, the company made an informed, cynical, and impressively coordinated decision that "payouts" (Kelman and Hamilton 1989:311) to families of burn victims were more cost-effective than improving fuel tank integrity. This description provides the unambiguous foundation on which the media and academics have built a Pinto gas tank decision-making narrative.<ref name=L&E>{{cite journal |title=Pinto "Madness," a Flawed Landmark Narrative: An Organizational and Network Analysis |first1=M.T. |last1=Lee |first2=M.D. |last2=Ermann |journal=Social Problems |volume=46 |number=1 |date=Feb 1999}}</ref></blockquote>

Additional misunderstanding surrounds the actual number of fire related deaths related to the fuel system design, "wild and unsupported claims asserted in 'Pinto Madness' and elsewhere",[31] the facts of the two most significant Pinto related legal cases, Grimshaw vs Ford Motor Company and State of Indiana vs Ford Motor Company, the applicable safety standards at the time of design, and the nature of the NHTSA investigations and subsequent vehicle recalls.<ref name=L&E/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Danley|first1=John R|title=Polishing Up the Pinto: Legal Liability, Moral Blame, and Risk|journal=Business Ethics Quarterly|date=2005|volume=15|issue=2|pages=205–236}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Schwartz |first=Gary T. |title=The Myth of the Ford Pinto Case |journal=[[Rutgers Law Review]] |volume=43 |year=1990 |pages=1013–1068 |url=http://www.pointoflaw.com/articles/The_Myth_of_the_Ford_Pinto_Case.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>

Opinions are needed on whether or not the "Domestic violence affects men, women, and children." sentence [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domestic_violence&oldid=710961063 in the lead] is redundant. One concern is that the sentence is redundant to what the first paragraph states because it is easy to see from the first paragraph that domestic violence affects men, women and children, and that the sentence is at conflict with what was the [[topic sentence]] in the third paragraph. The other concerns are that redundancy is an opinion, and that, even if the content is redundant, we can state the same thing more than once in the lead, and that the first paragraph doesn't use the word ''affects''.

Should the use of WP: shortcuts to point to user essays in userspace be deprecated?

'''Discussion'''

Despite the declaration on [[WP:SHORTCUT]] that '''[[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines#Adherence|The existence of a shortcut does not imply or prove that the linked page is a policy or guideline]].''' that disclaimer is not visible to anybody clicking on a shortcut. They arrive at the user essay with the mistaken impression that the user essay is actually a guideline carrying much more weight than it actually does. Even if the essay actually represented a community approved guideline having it in userspace would imply some [[WP:OWN|ownership]] of the guideline. In either case the shortcut is unintentionally and unnecessarily misleading.

I propose deprecating the use of WP: shortcuts to point at user essays in userspace.

Existing shortcuts should be replaced with a short page containing the disclaimer above with a link to the essay. If the essay passes an RfC and is accepted by the community then the shortcut should be replaced by the essay or a redirect to its approved version in WP: namespace.

{{rfcquote|text=
In the aftermath of the [[2016 Brussels bombings]], we have encountered a recurring dispute, namely: is there any use to be had in lists of world leaders' responses to high profile terrorist attacks like this? In the case of the Brussels attack, we have ended up with a separate article, [[Reactions to the 2016 Brussels bombings]]. There are several other articles like this (see the relevant category here:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Reactions_to_terrorist_attacks]). Now, while it's all well and good that Obama, David Cameron, Shinzo Abe, etc., have condemned the attacks in Brussels, did anyone think they wouldn't? Does anyone need to read the "response" article to know what the responses are going to be? I would argue that they don't. And consequently, the responses aren't notable. At the very least, ''all of them'' aren't notable. If we want to write something like "the attacks generated condemnation from world leaders", fine, but do we need the specific press release from the Latvian government? The response pages quickly become a collection of quotes and tend to promote a form of political pageantry. I would argue that that's not the purpose of Wikipedia. Now, I've never proposed a policy change before, so I welcome assistance/corrections in wording or procedure, but here it is. 

PROPOSAL: We adopt a policy by which the responses from world leaders to high profile terror attacks are not notable and (a) don't get their own articles and (b) don't take up large sections of the article about the attacks themselves.

Should the wiki article include a mention of the study on fans?  To be clear, I don't think anyone is advocating including a statement that fans reduce the risk of SIDS in the wiki article, as high-quality secondary sources do not make that claim.  Instead, the question is whether it is appropriate, in some form, to include a mention of the fact that this study was done (including its limitations), or whether the existence of the study cannot be mentioned at all. High quality secondary sources discuss the findings of the study, so they would be the basis of its inclusion. [[User:Wpegden|Wpegden]] ([[User talk:Wpegden|talk]]) 18:18, 18 April 2016 (UTC)}}

I suppose this question has probably asked before but I'm asking it anyway (philosophers will lose jobs if they are not allowed to do so.) So, are there deadlines for pages in the draft namespace? I thought there isn't one and some agree but some other disagree; cf. [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Draft:Moduli stack of elliptic curves]].

We might be able to agree that, say, a 90% complete draft can stay in the draft namespace; for example, the author is a perfectionist and doesn't want to move it to the main namespace unless it's really really complete. I think articles like that can and should stay in the draft namespace. What about one sentence page? A page with only outlines? If there are ''potentials'' for them to become main-namespace articles (e.g., passes notability), then I'm of the opinion that drafts like those can and should stay in the draft namespace. Because, why delete?, which is simply a counterproductive action. In my personal case, I'm in the middle of finishing my Ph.D. thesis and have no time to develop some of very-short drafts but I don't want them to be deleted (since I need to recreate them later.) Why must those drafts be deleted? For what end?

Should old user space drafts have an expiration date? [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:User_pages&oldid=711732169 Currently], [[WP:STALEDRAFT]] lists six specific actions that may be performed, with an ''implied'' default to keep the user draft indefinitely if its content falls into none of those six criteria. The purpose of this RfC is to establish if there is consensus to change the guideline to eventually delete user space drafts, either at MfD or some sort of [[WP:G13|timed default-delete]] criterion. Previous, closely related discussions have ranged about a bit, so I think it would be helpful if this discussion were kept as close to a binary yes/no as possible. Subsequent discussions after closure of the RfC would be used to determine how best to implement the consensus. [[User:VQuakr|VQuakr]] ([[User talk:VQuakr|talk]]) 15:52, 24 March 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
It is a fairly long established norm, I believe, that all High Schools (or national equivalents) which can be independently verified as being genuine, are considered notable.  [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Good_Shepherd_English_School]] seems to be trying to set a precedent for suggesting that as [[WP:SCHOOLOUTCOMES]] does not have the status of policy, it is being used rather than the [[WP:GNG]] in AfD discussions [and should not be]. It seems to me that this would be quite a significant change to the way school pages are treated and therefore suggest that we're probably better off with having a RfC rather than potentially complicated individual DRV. 

I'd like to put my cards on the table as someone who believes that [[WP:SCHOOLOUTCOMES]] is a useful way to make assessments about these kinds of pages. My reasoning is this: ''if'' a school exists (and we can find some evidence from an independent secondary source that it does exist), then this is indicative that there must also be a whole lot of other official paperwork associated with it which may be difficult to find and assess during the period of an AfD discussion. It seems to me that the only situation where there is ''zero official paperwork'' for an alleged school would be when it doesn't actually exist and therefore the page is a hoax. 

Second, I think it is highly unlikely that many secondary/high schools in much of the world get the kind of newspaper or book coverage that we might normally expect to see to assess the notability of a person or other kind of organisation. So if we're really going to be looking for in-depth coverage of an individual school - that we can easily find on the internet - then we're basically whistling for much of the world and wikipedia will remain as a bastion of information about English speaking Europe and North America.  Is there anything really more notable about [[Eton College]] than [[École Normale Hébraïque]]? Yes, there are likely books and newspaper articles regularly written about the former and none on the latter, but is that really the kind of [[WP:BIAS]] we want to encourage here?

Third, I think we're into difficult territory if we're going to start saying that categories of long-established notability consensus are somehow now not notable.  Because that moves us out of talking about schools and into talking about (for example) [[WP:STATION]] and a whole bunch of other common outcomes.  Again, I believe that these make sense, for example for train stations because in order to build and run a train station there must have been a whole lot of organisation and official paperwork which ''would'' show notability even if we can't actually put our hand on it over the internet.

''According to [[Amnesty International]], in late February 2016 Russian warplanes deliberately targeted civilians and rescue workers during their bombing campaign. Documents show attacks on schools, hospitals and civilian homes. The organization has said that "Russia is guilty of some the most egregious war crimes it has seen in decades". The Kremlin has denied these accusations. Video footage and testimony by rescue workers contradict these denials. The director of Amnesty's crisis response program, Tirana Hassan, has said that after bombing civilian targets, the Russian warplanes "loop around" for a second attack to target the humanitarian workers and civilians who are trying to help those have been injured in the first sortie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1645573/russia-guilty-of-syria-war-crimes-says-amnesty |title=Russia Guilty Of Syria War Crimes, Says Amnesty |website=News.sky.com |date=2016-02-21 |accessdate=2016-02-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Peter Yeung |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/russia-civilians-war-crimes-amnesty-international-a6887096.html |title=Russia committing war crimes by deliberately bombing civilians and aid workers, says Amnesty International &#124; Middle East &#124; News |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date= |accessdate=2016-02-28}}</ref>''

I've been following the discussions on this page and it is time to tackle this hard question in a proper way, so we can put a stop to reopening the same old questions.

:'''1. Is Tesla's ethnicity unknown according to known sources?'''
:'''2. Should the article state that his ethnicity is a disputed question?'''
:'''3. Are secondary sources which use primary sources as a reference more valuable than secondary sources which provide just a statement "Tesla's ethnicity is X"? What should be done if all source on this matter provide nothing more than statements not founded in reliable primary sources? Can Wikipedia make a decision that one group of sources are more valuable than the other based solely on the quantity, something that scientific and logical approach does not approve? How to establish that quantity? And more extremely, can Wikipedia then declare one group of sources not only to be more valuable that the other group, but to be entirely correct and another group to be entirely incorrect and  completely leave them out of article? 16:27, 27 April 2016 (UTC)}}

The discussion above suggests 4 possible routes:
# Do nothing.
# Allow the current ''"Talk"'' link to be manipulated to a specific associated talk page section.
# Allow the talk link option in the child issues templates to show.
# As #3, but also remove the main ''"Talk"'' link.

A fifth option not yet discussed (above) is to rethink the layout/presentation of multiple issues altogether; rather than effectively crippling the ''normal'' functionality of the child issues templates, we could collapse them to little more than a list of issues ''i.e. "Expert attention, cleanup and citations needed"'', then allow the reader to expand the whole template to show the full versions of the children, including their associated links where provided.&nbsp;[[User_talk:Fred_Gandt|<b style='font:1rem Arial;color:#066;text-decoration:inherit;'>f<i style='font-size:.7em;color:#0bb;'>red</i>g<i style='font-size:.7em;color:#0bb;'>andt</i></b>]] 17:14, 2 April 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
As someone who knows that the world wide web actually is, including its differences from the internet, I am at a loss as to how increasingly many products are technically classed as web content, even if they are not web content at all by definition. As if how it's distributed somehow changes what it actually is. I simply do not understand footnote #1; is it saying that if it's not available in a shop, then it's web content, regardless of what is it? I've removed several A7 tags from articles about computer programs that are mainly, if not only available via the web, but according to this guideline, I was wrong to do so ([[WP:A7]] links to this guideline), even though they're not in themselves web content (I'm talking here of things such as Android apps). A computer program is a computer program, regardless of how it's distributed. Under that rule, with the ever-growing use of the web as it slowly but surely replaces physical shops, it won't be that long before pretty much everything is classed as web content, even if it has nothing to do with the world wide web, but merely distributed via it. The web is already the primary, if not sole distribution medium for many products. If it's not actually on the web, it shouldn't come under here, but rather, [[WP:NPRODUCT]] or [[WP:NSOFTWARE]]. It's already extremely difficult, if not impossible to get many common programs (such as web browsers) from anywhere but the web, are they classed as web content? I'm also talking about other products that are available primarily/only via the web; it's just that I'm more familiar with computer programs that other types of product. Web content should mean just that; content that is accessed '''''and used''''' via the web (things like websites, blogs, youtube videos/channels etc, and note I said the ''web'', not the internet), otherwise the term "web content" as it's currently used is misleading. To sum up, if something's a product, it should come under the products guideline, regardless of how it's distributed. What are your thoughts on this?

There has been some discussion of what to do with abandoned pages (e.g. attempts at articles) in the user space of users who are not active. An example: a user registers an account, creates an article which is nowhere near ready for main space due to sourcing issues, and never edits again. There has been some drama about attempts to get rid of these articles. PROD looks like a good candidate for this housekeeping because of the lightweight process and the easy and uncontentious route to restoration. I therefore propose the following change to PROD:
:PROD is only applicable to [[Wikipedia:Main namespace|mainspace]] [[Wikipedia:What is an article?|articles]], [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (lists)|lists]], and [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation|disambiguation pages]]; it cannot be used with [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirects]], [[Wikipedia:User pages|userspace]] pages, [[Wikipedia:Template namespace|templates]], [[Wikipedia:Categorization|categories]], or pages in any other [[Wikipedia:Namespace|namespace]].
becomes:
:PROD is only applicable to [[Wikipedia:Main namespace|mainspace]] [[Wikipedia:What is an article?|articles]], [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (lists)|lists]], [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation|disambiguation pages]] and pages outside Draft space which are clearly intended as draft articles but which have been abandoned; it cannot be used with [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirects]], non-draft [[Wikipedia:User pages|userspace]] pages, [[Wikipedia:Template namespace|templates]], [[Wikipedia:Categorization|categories]], or pages in any other [[Wikipedia:Namespace|namespace]].

The article's current title does not follow [[WP:COMMON NAME]] or [[WP:CONCISE]]. I am proposing that the content of this article and the article on the pre-Franco party, [[Falange Española de las JONS]], be merged and moved into an article titled "Falange" for both the reasons just given and the reasons given below.

[[Brittanica]] calls this political party the Falange (http://www.britannica.com/topic/Falange). Brittanica says the party was founded in 1933, meaning that it does not regard the pre-Franco party as a separate party, whereas this article is on the party when Franco took over and there is another article on the pre-Franco party.

There are also many books that refer to the party as the Falange, the following are ten books refer to the party as the Falange, and this list is not exhaustive:

- ''Falange: A History of Spanish Fascism'' by Stanley Payne

- ''Encyclopedia of Politics: The Left and the Right''

I am turning to you for your unbiased and professional opinion about an edit on this article which concerns the archaeological site, Emmaus Nicopolis, a place in Israel, and where I have suggested a more neutral edit so as to read: "The site today is inside Canada Park and is maintained by the Jewish National Fund of Canada," as opposed to the current edit that reads: "The site today is inside Canada Park in the West Bank, and maintained by the Jewish National Fund of Canada." As it stands, people who espouse to the view that "Israel is an illegal occupant" have joined in on the Talk-Page discussion to voice their general disapproval at implying that the archaeological site is in Israel, while Jewish participants (including myself) have wanted to omit the words "West Bank" in the article, that is to say, to keep it neutral, without mentioning Israel, neither the West Bank. What do you think we should do with respect to this edit? Can you give your advice on how we ought to proceed and to reach a compromise? Simply put, is it wise to mention areas now fully under Jewish legal control and jurisdiction as only having been held by the Arab Legion of Jordan from 1948-1967, in other words, what some call the "West Bank", and with no mention of Israel? Emmaus is situated in the very center of Israel, the heart of Israel. In government circles, there is no discussion at all, no dialogue, to make the place negotiable for a return under Arab-rule or hegemony, since "Area C" in the Oslo II Accords (where the site is located) is clearly defined as remaining under "full Israeli civil and security control." It's non-negotiable. Any emphasis on "West-Bank" as being the location of this place would, in my mind, conjure-up an editor who wants to relive the past, but forget the present status of the place. A neutral edit, I think, would avoid any misconceptions about the current status of the place.[[User:Davidbena|Davidbena]] ([[User talk:Davidbena|talk]]) 00:32, 7 April 2016 (UTC)}}

There were various changes to the policy, whether it was good or bad, community-vetted or not is now out of the question, since we're making this RfC. There have been moves across namespaces under the guise of "improvement", "more attention" and such. Again, whether they were right or wrong or if there was any actual improvement or not is not the question here.

Should the following, bolded for clarity, be added to [[ExxonMobil climate change controversy]]?

Exxon also studied ways of avoiding {{CO2}} emissions if the [[East Natuna gas field|East Natuna gas field (Natuna D-Alpha block)]] offshore of Indonesia were developed. '''An October 1984 internal report from Exxon's top climate modelers said that the gas field contained over 70% carbon dioxide and that if the carbon dioxide were released to the atmosphere it would make the gas field "the world's largest point source emitter of {{CO2}} and raises concern for the possible incremental impact of Natuna on the CO2 greenhouse problem." Members of Exxon's board of directors told Exxon staff that the gas field could not be developed without a cost-effective and environmentally responsible method for handling the {{CO2}}.'''

Some Exxon directors accepted the emerging climate consensus. Others were less sure of the science, but agreed that as popular attention to global warming mounted, releasing Natuna's greenhouse gases into the air could turn into a public relations debacle, former employees said. Either way, directors repeatedly told project staff Natuna could not proceed unless the CO2 was handled in a cost-effective way that did not harm the atmosphere. "Their concerns kept getting stronger," said a former employee with knowledge of the project, who asked for anonymity because the issue remains sensitive even years later. "Their attitude went from, 'Maybe we have to remove the CO2,' to, as the years went by, their saying, 'This project cannot go ahead unless we remove the CO2.'"}}

Hello everyone,

According to [[Special:Permalink/712675628|a test case compiled by User:Trappist the monk]], out of 23 templates that implement the [[WP:CS1|CS1 citation sytle]], 17 of them place the publisher name (from {{para|publisher}}) between parentheses when there is a work title (from {{para|work}} or its numerous aliases like {{para|newspaper}}, {{para|website}}, etc.) In addition, {{tl|Citation}} also does this (with or without {{para|mode|cs1}}.) In all 24 cases, the parentheses do not appear when there is no work title.

The question is: Should we change the remaining 6 to adhere to this already-dominant style? In this discussion your verdicts may be:
# '''Support adding parentheses to 6 templates''' — Certainly one style (CS1) can only have one form used consistently, not two inconsistent forms for no reason whatsoever. Templates that need to be changed are {{tl|Cite web}}, {{tl|Cite encyclopedia}}, {{tl|Cite mailing list}}, {{tl|Cite newsgroup}}, {{tl|Cite press release}}, and {{tl|Cite podcast}}.
# '''Support removing parentheses from 18 templates''' — Templates that need to be changed are: {{tl|Cite AV media}}, {{tl|Cite AV media notes}}, {{tl|Cite book}},  {{tl|Cite conference}}, {{tl|cite DVD notes}}, {{tl|Cite episode}}, {{tl|Cite interview}}, {{tl|Cite journal}}, {{tl|Cite magazine}}, {{tl|Cite map}}, {{tl|Cite news}}, {{tl|Cite report}}, {{tl|Cite serial}}, {{tl|Cite sign}}, {{tl|Cite speech}}, {{tl|Cite techreport}}, {{tl|Cite thesis}}, {{tl|Citation}} (when {{para|mode|cs1}} is set)
# '''Retain status quo''' — in case you have a genius reason as to why consistency among different template ''implementing the same style'' must not be established. 

I'd like to invite the people already in the discussion to participate: {{u|Jonesey95}}, {{u|Jc3s5h}}, {{u|Redrose64}}, {{u|Trappist the monk}}, {{u|Imzadi1979}}, {{u|Izno}}, {{u|Nikkimaria}}

Hey all. For years we regularly get questions at various fora about maintenance template removal. (In fact, a few questions related to this issue were posted today ([[Wikipedia:Help desk#Ask for help|1]], [[Wikipedia:Teahouse/Questions#how to link up two articles?|2]].) The questions we often receive show that: 
*i) it is not obvious to many that maintenance templates are placed and removed manually. Many people assume there’s some mysterious automated threshold or A.I. program that governs removal; 
*ii) some people seem put off from helping out in the first place—refrain from tackling the problem the template flags—because the process of template removal is neither obvious nor transparent;  
*iii) because there’s nothing in the display of most templates to indicate to the reader that they can dive in to help, and no link to a page explaining the process (as proposed here), they assume it’s some job for an elite class of user (and so we lose the desperate help we need from the masses); and
*iv) people often do not grasp what needs to be done to address the issue flagged by the template, despite the links in them.
So, I’ve drafted [[Help:Maintenance template removal]]. The intent is that we ''add to the display of a variety of maintenance templates'' the following text, linked to this help page:
:* <span style="font-size:70%>[[Help:Maintenance template removal|Learn how and when to remove this template message]].</span>
I’ve spent a lot of time at this help page not just describing the ins and outs of the removal process, but a section addressing some some of our more important and high-use templates — explaining the issues involved, relevant guidelines and policies, and what needs to be done before removal.

If consensus is gained to add such a proposed link to maintenance templates, whether as currently drafted or as suggested after discussion, I will need some help from the more tech-savvy as to the proper way to incorporate the link into the templates. Right now my manner of adding it, as seen in the <nowiki>{{unreferenced}}</nowiki> example I used at the help page, does not play well with that template’s date parameter (“April 2016”), which should appear after the main text, not after the proposed link.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 01:57, 10 April 2016 (UTC)}}

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
{{tl|Infobox film}} states "''Insert the approximate production budget of the film. This is the cost of the actual filming, and does not include marketing/promotional costs (e.g. advertisements, commercials, posters) ... If there are conflicting estimates, do not cherry-pick; list each estimate either as an individual value or as a number range.''"

Film budgets are not usually released by film studios, but generally entertainment magazines and trade journals can obtain an approximate figure from industry insiders. The "budget" is usually taken to be the "negative cost" which is is generally defined as the costs incurred up to producing a negative, but will omit the distribution costs and profit participation for the stars. Sources will usually distinguish between the negative cost and the subsequent costs, such as ''[http://variety.com/2012/film/news/disney-to-finally-unleash-john-carter-1118051102/ Variety]'' observing "''the budget, which Disney quotes at around $250 million, with an additional $100 million to market the film worldwide''". If different sources provide different figures then these figures are represented as a range.

What is not so clear is how to represent figures that incorporate a tax credit and it is this quandary that is the subject of several ongoing film related discussions at [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Film#Film_budget_representation_in_infobox]]. For example, in the case of ''John Carter'' ''[http://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2014/10/22/revealed-the-307-million-cost-of-disneys-john-carter/2/#31f7d52e69d0 Forbes]'' obtained financial documents from the UK treasury which revealed "'''''Total costs''' came to $306.6 million ... The financial statements reveal that the British tax authority handed Disney $42.9 million (£27.1 million) to make John Carter ... The tax payment to John Carter gave the picture a '''net budget''' of $263.7 million which is far more than estimates predicted.''" Disney is on record as stating the budget is "[http://variety.com/2012/film/news/disney-to-finally-unleash-john-carter-1118051102/ around $250 million]".

The question being posed by this RFC is what should go in the infobox? These seem like the viable options to me:
#'''$250 million''' (EDIT: the cost as stated by Disney and widely reported at the time)
#'''$306.6 million''' (the total costs filed at HMRC)
#'''$263.7 million''' (the net budget, which is derived by subtracting the tax credit)
#'''$306.6 million ($263.7 million after tax credit)''' (the bit in brackets could actually go in brackets or as a footnote to avoid clutter)
#'''$263.7 million ($306.6 million before tax credit)'''
#'''$250–306.6 million ($263.7 million after tax credit)'''
#'''$250–306.6 million''' (the highest and lowest figure available)

Even though the discussions are spread over quite few articles they seem to be going in circles and would benefit from community input, which is the reason for the RFC. I think this article is the best "test case" for the RFC since it has some fairly concrete numbers and uses explicit terminology in how those numbers are delivered, such as an official statement on the finance by Disney, and exact details of the tax filings at HMRC.

The decision taken in the above [[Talk:Laura_Branigan#Consensus_discussion|Consensus discussion]] has been challenged. Additional sources have been presented suggesting a 1952 birth date.

As there are two options that could replace that decision (no date at all, footnoted or both dates, footnoted) I would suggest that to keep the discussion simple, '''editors should respond with "support" or "overturn"''' the consensus found above.

* ''[[David Starkey]] has described Elizabeth II as poorly learned, comparing her cultural refinement and intellectual curiosity to that of a "[[housewife]]".  The criticism was rejected by Marco Houston, editor of Royalty Monthly Magazine, who said that Elizabeth "may not have had the best formal education, but she has had the best education at the university of life".''
* ''The decision to admit [[William, Duke of Cambridge]] to a non-degree agriculture program at the [[University of Cambridge]] met with criticism from some who declared his entry as a "free pass" and "insult" to other Cambridge students, however, others noted the vocationally-oriented course was open to anyone with sufficient funds from the "[[wikt:posh|posh]] set" and not just royalty. Cambridge's student newspaper ''The Tab'' initially criticized William's admission, questioning whether his grades were sufficient to attend the university, but later backtracked, noting that the course was a short vocational certification and that the university customarily admitted pretty much anyone to it.''

It is time to bring further eyes to review this article. I have several concerns that cannot be resolved with the contributing editor.
:(1) the inclusion of alleged offensive and intimidating language which was denied by the subject, unsubstantiated and dismissed by a court. 
:(2) the inclusion of very minor traffic offences, such as an illegal U-turn, which appear to breach BLP considerations. 
:(3) a highly detailed list, including ABN and ACN, of every company with which the subject has been associated.

Notoriously, Seymour was only 15 when she dated and subsequently moved in with her 41 year old modeling agent John Casablanca.

The above discussion on popular culture has highlighted a fervent but inchoate mix of ideas among editors as to the status of EHS, a mess which is preventing progress in that discussion. The present RfC is aimed at clearing this up. The issue may also be complicated by the fact that claimed sufferers of EHS fall into two groups, those who have misdiagnosed some real symptom caused by something else and those who have worried themselves into developing adverse symptoms via the [[nocebo effect]]. I would ask for comments on two issues:
#'''Is EHS a medical topic?''' Note that it is generally <s>accepted</s> classed as an alternative diagnosis, i.e. the condition has no medical recognition.
#'''Is EHS pseudoscience?''' Note that several other alternative diagnoses based on unsound ideas such as [[Leaky gut syndrome]], [[Drapetomania]] and [[Mucoid plaque]] are currently categorised as such.

"In March 2016 the Israeli Intelligence and Atomic Energy Minister Yisrael Katz argued that Israel should employ “targeted civil eliminations” against leaders of the BDS movement. The expression puns on the Hebrew word for targeted assassinations.[48]"

'''to:'''

In March 2016 the Israeli Intelligence and Atomic Energy Minister [[Yisrael Katz (politician born 1955)|Yisrael Katz]] argued that Israel should employ “targeted civil thwarting” ({{Hebrew|1=<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif">”</span> סיכול אזרחי ממוקד  <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif">“</span>}}) against leaders of the BDS movement. The expression is a play on the Hebrew term for [[Targeted killings by Israel Defense Forces|targeted assassinations]]<ref>

When the moderator of the conference interview asked [[Yisrael Katz (politician born 1955)|Yisrael Katz]] to elaborate on the use of the words “targeted civil thwarting”, Katz goes on to say: {{Quote|text="“Targeted civil thwarting” means to expose those activities, people, systems, and mechanisms, and their ties with organizations which have already crossed the line towards militaristic terrorist activity. And indeed by exposing that we will know how to act against them, isolate them, and transfer information (on them) to different intelligence agencies in the world." |source=[[Yisrael Katz (politician born 1955)|Yisrael Katz]] - "Against the Boycott" Conference in Jerusalem' (March 28th, 2016)<ref> Yisrael Katz, [http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4784262,00.html  'Video Interview: "Against the Boycott" Conference in Jerusalem'][[Ynet]] (28  March 2016).</ref><ref> Yisrael Katz, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukXAFxI8Ix4&t=326  'Youtube Video Interview - English Transcription: "Against the Boycott" Conference in Jerusalem'][[Youtube]] (28  March 2016).</ref>}}

'''This should be changed because:'''

1. 972mag.com grossly misquoted both the source it refrences in its own article, and the minister himself by mistaking the hebrew word for “thwarting” {{Hebrew|1=<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif">”</span> סיכול <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif">“</span>}}, for the word “elimination” {{Hebrew|1=<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif">”</span> חיסול <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif">“</span>}}. Therefore the source should be removed completely and changed to the original source Ynet so to maintain the integrity of this wikipedia article.

2. The source should be changed from the 972mag.com to the actual video recording of the quote in question. '''Reference to quotes are not subject to interpretation''' when they are in their original context, and thus should be made directly to the source if available, in order avoid violating the Wikipedia.org sourcing policy.

3. Changed "puns on the Hebrew word" to "play on the Hebrew term...".

4. Added context for the full quote by [[Yisrael Katz (politician born 1955)|Yisrael Katz]], where he elaborates on his use of the term. 

5. References to Yisrael Katz wiki page, so not to be confused with former Minister of Labour and Social Welfare also of the name Yisrael Katz.

6. Added link to Youtube video of interview containing english transcription.

NOTE: An English translation is available in the following youtube video belonging to the user "boycott apartheid" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukXAFxI8Ix4

I'm wondering if the (Jesuit?) Christogram included at the top right of the page is appropriate? The editor who started this page has made dozens of pages with this icon. It falls outside of the infobox, which gives it a "branding" effect, in my view. I have basically zero knowledge of religious traditions, so apologies if I have any of the Christ-related wording wrong. Other pages "branded" with the same icon would be: [[Udayani Social Action Forum]], [[Ocer Campion Jesuit College]],[[Jesuit Migration Academic Network]], [[Dolores Mission, Los Angeles]] and [[Kateri Northwest Ministry Institute]]-- but there are many many more.

{{rfcquote|text=
There has been a long-running dispute relating to the status of the Zahiri school. It seems to have arrived at a consensus with respect to the [[Zahiri]] article, but we still have a disagreement about presentation in this template. There are two relevant areas of controversy:

# Encyclopedias and general histories commonly refer to the Zahiri madhhab as "extinct" or "defunct", while other sources cited in the article note that the modern Ahl-i-Hadith movement "consciously identified themselves with Zahiri doctrine", and that the maddhab is "prominent" among Salafis, though it is "not formally operating today". 
# While there is argeement that the Zahiri school was historically considered part of the Sunni legal community, some sources state that it was then "excluded from the Sunni consensus". It was conspicuously listed apart from the Sunni madhhabs in the [[Amman Message]], and we haven't been able to find a RS that explicitly refers to its modern form as "Sunni".

The question is how the Sunni Islam template should be designed in view of the above. Here are the options which have been floated:

# Leave the template as it is.
# Move Zahiri under "extinct"
# Move Zahiri on its own line with "disputed" in parentheses.
# Rename the "extinct" subsection to "other" and move Zahiri there.
# Remove Zahiri from this template altogether.

This has [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam_Warlock&type=revision&diff=537975092&oldid=537949399 come up before], but [[User:Arionapollo]] has brought this up on [[User talk:Argento Surfer#Adam Warlock|my talk page]] and I thought I'd invite more voices to the table since this could apply to other characters as well.

Basically, the [[Adam Warlock]] publication history currently says "The character debuted in Fantastic Four #66-67 ... [and had] a second appearance as "Him" in Thor #165-166" Arionapollo, citing CGC and Overstreet, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam_Warlock&type=revision&diff=719894035&oldid=719888695 wants to note] the ''Fantastic Four'' issues are a cameo, and specify the character's "first full appearance" as the ''Thor'' issues. However, 
* The FF issues present his origin in full. 
* Old ''Wizard'' magazines note that FF 66 is a cameo, and FF67 is the first appearance. 
* Marvel says his first appearance was [http://marvel.com/universe/Warlock,_Adam FF 66]. 
* There was a 2 year gap between the FF and Thor stories. 

I think the current wording is sufficiently generic, and avoids making a judgment on what's a cameo and what's a true first appearance. Google [https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=adam+warlock+first+appearance+thor+165 provides some additional support] for the Thor books, but all the top hits are from sites promoting the book for its sale value. 

[[Venom (comics)]] gives his first appearance as ASM #300, and specifies in the publication history he appeared in cameo on the last page of #299. 
[[Apocalypse (comics)]] gives his first appearance as X-Factor #5 in the lead, and the infobox specifies #5 was "in shadow" and #6 was "first full appearance". 
The lead and PH of [[Wolverine (character)]] mentions Hulk 180 as his "first appearance" and Hulk 181 as his "first full appearance". The infobox has Hulk 180 listed as a cameo.

# Should the publication history section or infobox distinguish between cameos and first appearances?
# Is this disagreement significant enough to discuss within the article?

Is there an issue with this intro?

The edit is as follows:

The '''Southern Levant''' roughly encompasses the lower half of the [[Levant]], resulting in some variance of geographical definition, with the widest definition including [[Israel]], [[Palestinian territories|the Palestinian Territories]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[southern Syria]] and the [[Sinai|Sinai Desert]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-238423237.html|title=Ancient Texts and Archaeology Revisited-Radiocarbon and Biblical Dating in the Southern Levant - Antiquity {{!}} HighBeam Research|website=www.highbeam.com|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref> In the field of archaeology, the southern Levant is "the region formerly identified as Syria-Palestine and including Canaan." <ref name="Burke">Burke, Aaron.

Historical Biblical Archaeology and the Future: The New Pragmatism. Ed. Thomas Evan. Levy. London: Equinox Pub., 2010. "Much work continues to be done in these regions, and not surprisingly this work is now of great interest to those studying the southern Levant (i.e. the region formerly identified as Syria-Palestine and including Canaan)...Nevertheless, despite such a well-reasoned basis for the identification of Levantine archaeology, the adoption of this term by many scholars has been, for the most part, simply the result of individual attempts to consider a wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus than that which is suggested by the use of terms like Canaan,Israel, or even Syria-Palestine. Regardless of the manner in which the term has come into common use, for a couple of additional reasons it seems clear that the Levant will remain the term of choice. In the first place scholars have shown a penchant for the term Levant, despite the fact that the term ‘Syria-Palestine’ has been advocated since the late 1970s. This is evident from the fact that no journal or series today has adopted a title that includes ‘Syria-Palestine’. However, the journal Levant has been published since 1969 and since 1990 Ägypten und Levante has also attracted a plethora of papers relating to the archaeology of this region. Furthermore, a search through any electronic database of titles reveals an overwhelming adoption of the term ‘Levant’ when compared to ‘Syria-Palestine’ for archaeological studies. Undoubtedly, this is mostly due to the fact that ‘Syria-Palestine’ is, correctly speaking, the title for a Roman administrative division of the Levant created by Hadrian (Millar 1993). The term ‘Syria-Palestine’ also carries political overtones that inadvertently evoke current efforts to establish a full-fledged Palestinian state. Scholars have recognized, therefore, that—for at least the time being—they can spare themselves further headaches by adopting the term Levant to identify this region"</ref> Archaeologically, it is among the most extensively excavated regions in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/10962261/A_passion_for_cultural_difference._Archaeology_and_ethnicity_in_the_southern_Levant|title=A passion for cultural difference.

{{rfcquote|text=
There has been some confusion as to the purpose of the draft namespace as well as the minimum standard for draft articles. Given this situation, I would like to propose the following standard for the draft articles in the draft namespace.
:''A draft article must clearly indicate the notability of the topic (but not necessary its importance which can be added later.) This requirement can be met, for example, by giving a relevant reference. The draft article should also be written in such a way that it is clear that, some day when it is developed enough, it can be moved to the main namespace.
Since I'm not a native English speaker, please feel free to suggest different phrasing if you can think any. Please also note what is missing. We don't require draft articles to have AfC reviews or some kind of submission procedures. This is very natural; there is no requirement like AfC submissions or deadlines for main space articles and it would be unnatural to demand more ''stringent'' review requirement for draft articles.

My hope is to dispel some confusion like the draft namespace is only for AfC or some other training-wheels-uses, as it is not. Also, most importantly, draft articles should be not deleted unless they fail these community-agreed requirements and not some other ''personal'' requirements editors impose as they feel like. I believe we should agree on ''what'' to delete before we discuss ''how'' to delete them. (I'm happy with streamlining the deletion process.) -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 03:36, 26 May 2016 (UTC)}}

As is well known, our rules are supposed to codify existing practice. The existing practice for [[WP:NOSHARE]] seems somewhat up in the air, and I'm wondering if the community wants codify this, or double down on the old practice, or what. Therefore I'm raising the a proposal for a change. This is an advisory RfC in that I don't have a strong opinion either way, I am just wanting to gauge the current state of community opinion on a rule that probably was written some time ago, and may have drifted from current practice. [[WP:NOSHARE]] currently reads:
:{{xt|Any user account should represent an individual and not a group (and an individual should normally only have one user account; see next section). Sharing an account – or the password to an account – with others is not permitted, and evidence of doing so will result in the account being blocked. For accounts being used to represent a group or organization, see Promotional names and Usernames implying shared use above.}}

:{{xt|Exceptions to this rule can be made for non-editing accounts approved to provide email access, accounts approved by the Wikimedia Foundation (see list), and bot accounts that are maintained by more than one contributor, provided the existence of such an arrangement is made clear and has consensus.}}
Here is the proposed change, based on what may be new practice. I've bolded the changes just to highlight them for this RfC, I'm not proposing that they actually be bolded in the text of the rule.
:{{xt|Any user account should represent an individual and not a group (and an individual should normally only have one user account; see next section). Sharing an account – or the password to an account – with others is not permitted, and evidence of doing so '''<s>may</s> will result in the user being asked to stop the practice and change their password, or in sanctions (up to and including the account being blocked), depending on circumstances.'''

Dispute about whether the album should be considered a long-form narrative.

There have been disputes on several articles changing the grosses in charts to the all-time grosses (thus incorporating reissue grosses). For example, on its original 1982 release E.T grossed $359 million, but that rose to $435 million thanks to two re-releases in 1988 and 2002. The question here is which figure should ideally go in this chart? '''Option 1''': $359 million from the 1982 release; or '''option 2''': $435 million collated from the 1982, 1988 and 2002 releases?

==Background'''

{{see also|Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC 3|Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Archivedotisbot|Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Requests for closure/Archive 14#Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC 3|l3=complete list of related discussions}}
''[[Archive.is]]'' is an archiving service similar to sites like Webcite and the Wayback Machine.  ''archive.is'' is on the en.wikipedia.org [[Wikipedia:Spam-blacklisting]].  This prevents it's use as a reference source URL.

Based on the questions of consensus raised within [[MediaWiki_talk:Spam-blacklist#archive.is|talk Spam-blacklist]], the community should discuss and vote on whether the previous consensus, established in [[Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC 3]], should remain in force.

'''Effect of Blacklisting ("Blocking")'''

Article source links that refer to ''archive.is'' are currently disallowed.  Any edit incorporating a new URL that starts with <code><nowiki>https://archive.is/</nowiki></code>, will result in the editor being returned to their draft changes (''Edit'' view) with a warning notice which reads (in part)
<blockquote>
<div style="background:LightPink">
Your edit was not saved because it contains a new external link to a site registered on Wikipedia's blacklist.<br />
To save your changes now, you must go back and ''remove the blocked link'' (shown below), and then save.<br />
...<br />
</div>
<div style="background:Azure">
The following link has triggered a protection filter: '''archive.is'''
</div>
</blockquote>
([https://imgur.com/NVZxS2n Here is a picture of the entire warning notice]).
The warning notice prevents the change referencing the ''archive.is'' URL from being saved.

'''Previous RFCs'''

For review, there have been three previous RFC on this topic.
* [[Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC]]
* [[Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC 2]]
* [[Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC 3]]
The User is invited to consider them before voting.

# (optional) further discussion can be added under the '''''Discussion''''' section.

I'm trying to reach consensus over which table should be used in the main article. The first, smaller table, includes only the finalists of the merged version. The second includes finalists from the merged version as well as the national finalists of each branch during the cycle. It would be very appreciated if other users would put their imput into this discussion. For the record, I choose '''Table B'''. My logic is that while I agree that tables should be kept consistent to each other, the format of this show itself was vastly different from most other versions. That in itself demands that information be presented differently for a better understanding of the show.

Shall the titles of the [[:Category:Stanley Cup Finals|all the Stanley Cup series articles]] keep "Final'''S'''", with an "S" at the end, or should they be moved to "Final", removing the "s".

Greetings my fellow Wikipedians,

I just stumbled on this article and wanted to request comments on an addition of a section to this article. I am in the process of reading The Firm by [[John Grisham]]. This book, and its film adaptation, makes frequent reference to the Caymans and its establishments; additionally, the book's plot revolves heavily around the islands. I'm also very certain that other books, shows, or movies at least make passing mention of the island. I have seen numerous "In Popular Culture" sections in other articles. For example, take many of the military rank articles. I don't see these, however, on many other kinds of articles, even though they may be beneficial. I feel that is the case here. I'd like to hear other editors' opinions, and would very much like to see this section added here.

Thank you for your time and comments,

An editor altered the meaning behind the highlighting in the "multiple champions" table: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_world_snooker_champions&diff=718323216&oldid=718323069]. Specifically, the highlighting used to indicate that the player will be competing in the next world championship (once the draw is made), is competing in the current world championship once it begins, and competed in the most recent world championship once it ends. And thus the cycle begins again with the next draw. The changes have altered the highlighting to indicate whether a player is now retired or not. The two meanings are not tautological because a retired player can compete in the world championship, and it is possible that a non-retired player does not compete in the world championship (through suspension/illness). Should the highlighting refer to '''option 1''': the player is competing in the current (or most recent) world championship; or '''option 2''': the player is merely "active" on the circuit? I suppose there is also an '''option 3''', which is simply to drop the highlighting altogether. [[User:Betty Logan|Betty Logan]] ([[User talk:Betty Logan|talk]]) 01:30, 3 May 2016 (UTC)}}

{{Anchor|Discussion: Include the MergeHistory tool}}
I suggest that the <code><nowiki>mergehistory</nowiki></code> right also be included. It provides access to [[Special:MergeHistory]] through which [[WP:HM|history merges]] can be performed. 

Unlike manual history merges by admins (which involve a sequence of moves, deletions and undeletions), merges done using MergeHistory are easy to revert. It can only be used for merging histories that run non-parallely and [[Special:Log/merge|log entries]] exactly indicate the timestamp of the latest merged-in edit, making merge acrions easily revertible. MergeHistory can only be used for performing simple history merges. Many (which typically require the deletion of a few redirect edits) woud still require admin intervention. 

<u>Why this is needed?</u> There is a ''huge'' backlog at [[WP:WikiProject History Merge]] that has remained nearly dormant for ''years''. There is also a smaller backlog at [[:Category:Possible cut-and-paste moves]]. These backlogs could benefit from increased attention.

{{rfcquote|text=
This article up until March used to include the World Grand Prix results (the 2015 and 2016 entries in the table) until this was contested by Armbrust. Armbrust [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Open_(snooker)&diff=708032340&oldid=704346010 contested the view that the World Grand Prix was not a rebranded continuation of the World Open, but a new tournament and removed the WGP results]. He provided sources that referred to it as the "inaugural" tournament. This was contested by several editors who pointed out that World Grand Prix held the same spot on the calendar, had the same broadcaster and also used the historic Grand prix/World Open trophy which had the previous winners engraved on the trophy alongside those of the World Grand Prix. An IP editor [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Open_(snooker)&diff=708830190&oldid=708828806 initiated a cut and paste move] which was subsequently reverted. This led to me proposing a rename at [[#Requested move 11 March 2016]] for the article (to move the article to the World Grand Prix page) but the proposed move resulted in a "no consensus".

The question remains over what to do with the World Grand prix results. An IP is persisting in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Open_%28snooker%29&type=revision&diff=718335962&oldid=718070726 removing the results], effectively splitting the World Grand Prix content to its own article. The problem with this is that it has implications for performance table in the player articles. Case in point: if you look at [[Judd_Trump#Performance_and_rankings_timeline]], you will see there is an entry for the World Grand Prix twelve tournaments down the list. This entry combines the World Open and World Grand Prix results as this article did: the problem though is that if a completely new article is created to house the World Grand Prix results the World Open/World Grand Prix entries in the performance tables need to be also split into separate entries too, otherwise the performance tables link to the wrong tournament. Up to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/World_Open_(snooker)&limit=250 250 articles are affected in all].

So there are two options:
* '''No split''' - We retain the status quo in accoridance with the "no consensus" result from the move discussion and house the World Grand Prix results at the World Open article, and thus retaining the internal link integrity.
* '''Split''' - We split out the World Grand Prix results to its own article, but this will necessitate the fixing of the entries in the performance tables at the player articles that are effected by the split.

Currently, the policy states the following about appealing RevDel.
"Actions performed using this tool remain visible in the public logs. They are subject to review by other administrators (who can see redacted material), and to reversal upon clear, wider consensus.

"Material must be grossly offensive, with little likelihood of significant dissent about its removal. Otherwise it should not be removed."

Should this article's infobox include Blackstone Group in the "owner" parameter?

I submitted a request to remove Blackstone Group from the infobox (see the [[Talk:Hilton_Worldwide#Request_for_updates_to_infobox|Request for updates to infobox]] section above, or more specifically, the [[Talk:Hilton_Worldwide#Re:_Blackstone_Group|Re: Blackstone Group]] subsection). Hilton Worldwide is a publicly traded company. According to infobox template documentation (bold emphasis mine), we should "Use [the owner] parameter to list ownership percentages for private companies owned by a few key individuals or to list ownership percentages for joint ventures, if applicable. '''Do not use this field for publicly traded companies.''' When listing a company as an owner, use the full legal name of the entity that holds the ownership stake in the article's subject company."

[[User:Toohool]] disagrees with the infobox documentation. [[User:Altamel]] does not feel strongly either way, but offered the following compromise: "perhaps Blackstone Group could be removed from the infobox while writing a sentence in the introduction about Blackstone's plurality ownership stake". I agreed to this compromise. User:Toohool did not accept the compromise, and User:Altamel closed the edit request saying there is no consensus for update the article accordingly.

I think template documentation supports my argument, but Blackstone Group remains in the infobox and I am not willing to edit the article myself given my conflict of interest (see multiple sections above). I would like for more editors to weigh in on this discussion. Thank you in advance. [[User:Inkian Jason|Inkian Jason]] ([[User talk:Inkian Jason|talk]]) 19:55, 5 May 2016 (UTC)}}

There has been considerable edit-warring here lately by an IP removing the UK term. It has been restored by multiple editors.  I see this as a purely behavioural and POV issue, but before going to ANEW would like to confirm consensus from others.

IMHO, both terms are needed and should be used. This is our usual behaviour.

The IP has made similar edits at [[Mars (chocolate bar)]]. They have raised an RfC here to try and discredit a source showing the prior British invention, but that gained no support. They have claimed, incorrectly, that ENGVAR requires the UK alternative name to be removed (obviously it doesn't). They have used a variety of IPs (a large British ISP), but this is just technical and should not be construed as deliberate socking. They have even raised a protected edit request, when the article was protected against their own edit warring.

A common problem I come across while new page patrolling is tagging pages with CSD tags. It's a problem because they can take hours to be deleted. There are so many users who have very lengthy CSD logs with mostly red-links, and the encyclopedia would benefit greatly by allowing editors other than administrators to delete pages. The deletion log is likely the lengthiest log, because hundreds of pages are deleted daily. It's strange that such a common process can only be done by sysops. I'm proposing that these rights be added to the proposed 'deleter' user-group: <code>delete</code>, <s><code>undelete</code> and <code>deleterevision</code></s>. The deletion of articles would also be restricted to pages created in the last 24 hours and with less than a certain number of edits (I propose 15). <span style="font-family:sans-serif; color:red">&mdash; <span style="font-weight:bold">[[User:Music1201|<span style="color:green"> Music1201</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Music1201|<span style="color:red">talk</span>]]</sup></span></span> 03:53, 31 May 2016 (UTC)}}

Per {{U|Oiyarbepsy}}'s [[Template talk:Rfd2#Template produces hopeless technobabble|request to simplify the raw wikitext result of substituting rfd2]], I worked to build {{tl|rfd2 links}} and have implemented its use in {{tl|rfd2/sandbox}}.

* It is proposed to make this the default configuration for {{tlc|rfd2}}.

There is a concern that whilst {{tlc|rfd2 links}} is transcluded in use, any changes to the template would be reflected in the transclusions, which at any time may be many.

Non-[[WP:AFC|AFC]] drafts in draftspace have no G13 method for automatic deletion or for any review at all.

Attempts to add G13 or other criteria have been repeatedly and expressly rejected so instead these pages take up a lot of time at [[WP:MFD]] where deletion is somewhat routine. I'd like to propose that we allow for a new draft proposed deletion system with the following rules:
# Draftspace drafts that are not tagged with AFC that haven't been edited in six months can be considered.
# If the deletion is proposed, it would go into a dated category similar to [[:Category:Proposed deletion]] for at least ''one month'' at which time any one can remove the proposal for ''any reason whatsoever''. This is similar to the 5 month notification of [[:Category:AfC G13 eligible soon submissions]] with a month before G13.
# After a month with no deletion, an admin can then decide if it's worth deleting.
I've added header for support as is and a separate support in case people support the general concept but disagree on the six month/one prod timeline. -- [[User:Ricky81682|Ricky81682]] ([[User talk:Ricky81682|talk]]) 21:34, 20 May 2016 (UTC)}}

The name "Persian Gulf" is disputed (see [[Persian Gulf naming dispute]]) and although it is ''widely accepted'' in accordance with WP guidelines [[WP:WIAN]], it is not used by Arab states. A recognised (by BGN, Google maps and various atlases) ''alternative name'' is "Arabian Gulf". As a compromise:
:Should the name be determined by the article content? For example, an article about an Arab entity would use the term "Arabian Gulf", while an article on a Persian/Iranian entity would use "Persian Gulf"?

{{ARBGMO talk notice|style=long}}

This is a '''Request for Comment''', conducted under [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee/Discretionary sanctions|discretionary sanctions issued by the Arbitration Committee]], concerning how to indicate the scientific views on the safety of genetically modified crops for human consumption.

'''Introduction'''

[[#Comments|''Jump to comments section.'']]

'''Purpose of this RfC'''

The following pages are affected by this RfC:
{{cot|List of pages|bg=#F2E0CE}}
*[[Genetically modified food controversies]] (lead and health section)
*[[Genetically modified crops]] (lead and controversy section)
*[[Genetically modified food]] (lead and health and safety section)
*[[Genetically modified organism]] (controversy section)
*[[Genetically modified canola]] (controversy section)
*[[Genetically modified maize]] (controversy section)
*[[Genetically modified soybean]] (controversy section)
*[[March Against Monsanto]] (background section)
*[[Regulation of the release of genetically modified organisms]] (lead)
*[[Biotechnology]] (agriculture section)
*[[Denialism]] (genetically modified foods section)
{{cob}}

Each of these pages has language similar to: {{tq|There is general scientific agreement that food on the market derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but should be tested on a case-by-case basis.}} Editors are generally dissatisfied with this wording, but disagree about how to revise it. '''This RfC presents options for content to replace that wording, and is intended to determine community consensus about that.'''

Specifically, '''you are asked to address two questions''':

1. Based upon the policies, guidelines, and concepts related to [[scientific consensus]], listed [[#Policies, guidelines and essays to keep in mind|below]], do the preponderance of reliable sources (see citations in the [[#Proposals|listed proposals]]) indicate that there is a scientific consensus about the safety of genetically modified food with respect to human health?

2. Should the existing language be changed, and which content [[#Proposals|proposal(s)]], if any, best represent the answer to question 1 for inclusion in the articles listed above?

'''Rules'''

Under the authority granted to Uninvolved Administrators and by the terms of the [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Genetically modified organisms|Arbitration Committee GMO case]], and [[WP:ACDS|Standard Discretionary Sanctions]] as [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Genetically modified organisms#Discretionary Sanctions|authorized by that case]], the following limits are imposed on debate:

*'''All editors are required to maintain a proper level of decorum'''. Unnecessary rudeness, hostility, casting aspersions, and battleground mentality '''will not be tolerated''' here, in the interest of arriving at a clear, fair-minded consensus. Inappropriate conduct may be met with warnings, blocks, or bans from further participation in this RfC as the administrator deems necessary. To foster a collaborative atmosphere, editors are encouraged not to bring statements made here to Arbitration Enforcement, but rather to leave it to the patrolling admins.
*The '''sole purpose''' of this RfC is to determine consensus about a specific question concerning article content. It is not a venue for personal opinions about GMOs in general, nor a place to relitigate past disputes.
*All comments '''must''' be about article ''content'' or the ''content'' of users' proposals. Comments on any contributor, ''ad hominem'', attacks, aspersions, or that are found in any other way to not conform to the standards prescribed herein, '''are prohibited'''. 
**Any violations of these restrictions '''will be reverted, removed, or redacted'''. 
**Violating editors '''will face blocks or discretionary sanctions''', with or without warning and at the discretion of an administrator.
*If you came here because someone asked you to, or you read a message on another website, please note that this is [[Wikipedia:Polling is not a substitute for discussion|'''not a majority vote''']], but instead a ''discussion'' among Wikipedia contributors. Wikipedia has [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|policies and guidelines]] regarding the encyclopedia's content, and [[Wikipedia:Consensus|'''consensus''']] (agreement) is gauged based on the merits of the arguments, not by counting votes.
*If you believe that a user is violating policy or the rules set forth by Arbcom or by this page, and you cannot work it out between yourselves, please speak to an Enforcement admin at their talk page or at ANI, '''not here or on this RFC's talk page'''. If you believe an admin is behaving inappropriately, their decisions may be appealed to [[WP:ANI]], [[WP:AE]] or Arbcom directly.
*Please '''do not make changes''' in proposals that have already been posted. '''Anyone is permitted to post additional proposals''', below the existing proposals.
*'''Threaded discussion is prohibited on the RfC page'''. To comment in the RfC, you '''must''' create '''your own section''' within the [[#Comments|Comments]] section, placing your username in the section header. Within your own section, you may present your opinions on the proposals, and briefly pose questions to other editors or respond to questions from other editors. Do not make "support" or "oppose" comments under each proposal; indicate these opinions instead within your own section. '''Do not make any edits in any other editor's section'''. A section may be edited '''only''' by the editor to whom it corresponds, and by enforcing administrators. Editors are encouraged to discuss and collaborate with one another on the RfC Talk page, where threaded discussion is permitted and there are no word limits.
*In each comment section, each editor is '''strictly limited to 800 words''', including replies to other editors. ([http://wordcounttools.com Word Count Tool]) There will be no exceptions. Excessively long statements will be hatted until shortened.
*{{user|KrakatoaKatie}}, {{user|Nakon}}, and {{user|Deor}}, have agreed to serve as a panel of three experienced, uninvolved editors who will close the RfC after 30 days and determine the consensus (if any). Because this is such a contentious area, the RfC will run for '''the full 30 days''', unless additional time is needed to judge consensus, and closing early as per [[WP:SNOW]] is unlikely.
*The consensus reached (if any) '''will be imposed as a Discretionary Sanction''' on the topic area, broadly construed. It may be overturned only by another widely published full 30-day RfC, a consensus of administrators at [[WP:AE]], or by decree of the Arbitration Committee.

*Nobody is required to participate in this RfC, and anybody may cease participation at any time for any reason. However, it is in everyone's best interest that we solicit a wide range of opinions so that we may achieve a strong consensus.
*Finally, if you have issue with my own conduct or with these rules, we request that you please discuss with us on our own user talk pages before escalating. We am always willing to listen to a reasonable argument.

I don't see the point of A9 any more.

For context, the Wachowski Brothers have both come out as transgender women in the time since ''The Matrix'' was released. They are now credited as [[the Wachowskis]], not the Wachowski Brothers.

This is a matter that has been argued over extensively. A 2012 discussion at WikiProject Film ended with the determination that the infobox should reflect names as they appear in the credits, but I have not been able to find any such consensus for anything outside of the infobox.

This template uses a parameter, "end", to display a reason for the termination of a marriage. The template documentation advises that the end date should be the date a marriage was dissolved or the date that the spouse of the article subject died. However, in the event of a marriage ending by the death of the article subject, it is possible to signal that by using "end=widowed", for example <nowiki>{{marriage|Joan Smith|1916|1942|end=widowed}}</nowiki> produces the output "Joan Smith ({{abbr|m.|married}} 1916; {{abbr|wid.|widowed}} 1942)", attempting to indicate that Joan Smith was widowed in 1942.

Per the essay [[Wikipedia:Famous Residents]] I propose that we use these 3 criteria for inclusion on the [[Ipswich]] article:
# Notability: The person must be notable enough to have an article in Wikipedia.
# Residence: The person must be or must have been a true resident of Ipswich itself; not a seasonal or short-term resident; not a resident of a nearby locale or community. Such residence must be verifiable through cited, reliable sources.
# Significance to Ipswich: The person's notability must derive from the location OR the person must have derived the basis for their notability in that location OR the person must hold some significance to the location in general. Examples: an artist who was notable for painting scenes of the town; an author who wrote a book about the town; a singer who developed his/her talent and/or was "discovered" in Ipswich while they were living there; a professional athlete who developed his/her talent in a local athletic team; a mass-murderer who lived in the town when he/she murdered his/her victims; an actor who establishes his/her notability prior to living in the town, but is now a resident who uses his/her notability to benefit local charities or becomes a public servant.
Inclusions must meet all 3 criteria. [[User:Keri|Keri]] ([[User talk:Keri|talk]]) 10:13, 11 May 2016 (UTC)}}

Currently, [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Comics#Titles]] specifies that "comic book series, comic strips and comics publications should be italicized. For the titles of comic book storylines, chapters, comic strip episodes, an individual editorial cartoon or gag panel, editors should use quotation marks." It give as examples:
{{quote|* {{xt|''Identity Crisis''}}, the title of a [[DC Comics]] [[limited series]], should be italicized. {{xt|"Identity Crisis"}}, the title of a Spider-Man storyline that leads to the creation of the [[Slingers]], should be in quotation marks. [...]
* In 2006, Marvel published the {{xt|"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]"}} cross-over event. The flagship title of the event is the limited series {{xt|''Civil War''}}.}}

The MOS does not specify comic-book features. These currently appear generally in quote marks, i.e., the feature "Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD" in ''Strange Tales'' as opposed to the series ''Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD''. (See ''[[Strange Tales]]''.) But this is not formal MOS. How should the MOS address features? --[[User:Tenebrae|Tenebrae]] ([[User talk:Tenebrae|talk]]) 14:34, 11 May 2016 (UTC)}}

* [[User:קיפודנחש/pgn viewer demo|kipod's]] takes [[Portable Game Notation]] (PGN) and optional [[Forsyth–Edwards Notation]] (FEN) for non-standard set-up.
** It will output the PGN in a raw format for users with JavaScript disabled.

** It will fallback to an animated .gif (if provided) for users with JavaScript disabled.
Both these demonstration examples require the addition of JavaScript to [[Special:MyPage/common.js|your common JS]] to see them. This RfC is to determine if and how such a feature might be woven into the fabric of Wikipedia such that ALL users will see the proposed functionality by default.

As [[WP:INTDAB|INTDAB]] indicates, links in mainspace to disambiguation pages are usually (but not always) wrong. [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] does a great job of catching these links when they are added, and letting the editor know on their talk page, but, as [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links]] makes clear, there is significant non-response to these bot messages. It seems to me that we would have greater compliance if we could intercede ''before'' changes are saved.

I propose a high-attention message and two buttons that appear when "Save" is clicked (with the exception of disambiguation pages, which often intentionally link to other disambiguation pages), modeled on DPL bot, e.g.: "You have added [a link{{!}}links] pointing to the disambiguation page[s] [X, Y, and Z]. Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of "Did you mean..." article titles." Buttons: [Return to edit][Save anyway]. So:

If viewing this from the RfC page or an alert on your talk page, the full discussion starts at [[Talk:Eidetic memory#Eidetic vs. photographic]]. One concern is that "It should be very clear to readers that 'eidetic images' (in psychology) and 'photographic memory' are not the same things. Photographic memory does '''not''' exist, and eidetic images are generally not found in adults and they don't allow people to perform spectacular memory feats. [...] 'Eidetic imagery' in psychology is not 'photographic memory' -- it refers to the brief impression of an image that children sometimes see, and it has '''nothing to do with adults who memorize things'''. There is no science to support that." The other concern is that "'''most of the sources [...] are clear that the terms are used interchangeably''' or that photographic memory and eidetic memory '''are''' the same topic, but that the term ''eidetic memory'' is more accurate; if they distinguish photographic memory and eidetic memory at all, it's only slightly. In other words, sources usually treat these topics side by side and as the same thing while other sources distinguish them or slightly distinguish them."

So the issue is this: Should we be strict in stating that eidetic memory and photographic memory are not the same thing? Or should we should initially treat the terms as the same thing, with "photographic memory" as the [[WP:Alternative title]], and then relay that the terms are sometimes distinguished? Sources for examining the terminological matter are below. I will alert [[WP:WikiProject Psychology]] and [[WP:Biology]] to this discussion.

While eidetic imagery is most likely the source of the concept of a photographic memory, there are differences in the two concepts. An eidetic image fades soon after one sees the original image and does not stay with a person over time. The image is subjective, and the details of greatest interest to the person are the ones most easily reproduced. Moreover, a person cannot form an eidetic image in one second, as a camera can snap a photo; several seconds are required to scan the picture. Once the picture has faded away, eidetic images cannot be retrieved. Those who can form eidetic images do not seem to be able to use their special ability to improve long-term memory.}}

Per [[Wikipedia:Summary_style#Rationale]], for major topics Wikipedia should ''"distribute information across related articles in a way that can serve readers who want varying amounts of details, thus giving readers the ability to zoom to the level of details they need and not exhausting those who need a primer on a whole topic"''. It goes on to discuss the parent-child article structure. I have tried in different ways to get the community focused on this question for the huge and complex Israel-Palestine topic, but I have continually failed to get a proper discussion going, probably because I have been asking the wrong question. Here is another attempt, with a hopefully better question.

Please could editors comment as to whether you believe that this article should be the overall parent article of the whole conflict, which began in 1917 or 1920 depending which scholar you look at. Proposed options below:
* '''Yes, this article should be the parent article of the whole conflict'''
* '''No, the parent is at another article''' 
* '''No, we don't need a parent article; the split of three top articles is fine'''

The [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sia_Furler&oldid=723873369 current revision] uses "Sia" throughout the whole article. I want to change from "Sia" to "Furler" to be consistent with the present title. However, in previous discussions, consensus prefer "Sia" in the infobox instead.

I was under the impression that the following sentence was [[WP:SYNTH]] (and another editor thought it was [[WP:OR]]) because it implies that the air action of the Pleiku Campaign was more significant than the ground action of the Battle of Ia Drang without the sources making that claim, or that it violates [[WP:N]] by challenging the significance of this battle; I also feel that the comparison being made is between two things that aren't easily compared, so I don't think the comparison needs to be made in this article at all:
<blockquote>"The air action spent more times,[68] operated in a wider areas,[69] committed more units[70] and attacked more enemy forces,[71] than the ground action."</blockquote>
The editor that wrote this sentence claims that it is a statement of facts that're reliably sourced, and that the comparison is [[WP:BLUE]]. Does this sentence violate any policy or guideline, need rewording, or need removal?

{{rfcquote|text=
The lead already says: "A nominated article is marked for at least seven days; if nobody objects, it is considered by an uninvolved admin, who reviews the article and may delete it or may remove the PROD tag. "

To make the rest of the policy consistent with that, the following changes are proposed:

* In the lead:

<blockquote>;There are three steps to the PROD process:
# To nominate an article, place the {{tlxs|Proposed deletion|2=concern=''reason for proposed deletion''}} tag on the page. This is automatically converted to a {{tlx|proposed deletion/dated}} which lists the article in [[:Category:Proposed deletion]]. You should notify the article's creator or other significant contributors by adding the {{Tlsp|Proposed deletion notify|''Name of Article‎''}} tag or other appropriate text to contributor talk pages.
# If anybody objects to the deletion (usually by removing the {{tlx|proposed deletion/dated}} tag—see full instructions below) <u>within seven days of the PROD tag being placed</u>, the proposal is aborted and may not be re-proposed.
# The article is first checked and then deleted by an administrator seven days after nomination (or any time after seven days that an administrator reviews the article). It may be [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion|undeleted upon request]]. If the reviewing administrator does not agree with the deletion they may remove the PROD tag instead of deleting the article.</blockquote>

* In the "Objecting" section (with notes removed only to reduce clutter)<br>

<blockquote>'''To object to and therefore permanently prevent a proposed deletion <u>during the seven days after the PROD tag has been placed</u>''',remove the {{tlx|proposed deletion/dated}} tag from the article. You are encouraged, but not required, to also:
# Explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion, either in the edit summary or on the talk page.
# Consider notifying the editors involved in the PROD by placing a {{tl|Deprod}} tag on their user talk page.
# Add or modify an {{tl|Old prod full}} tag on the article's talk page, to prevent renomination under Proposed deletion. It will then be listed at [[:Category:Past proposed deletion candidates]] for easy tracking.
# Consider improving the article to address the concerns raised.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'''If anyone, including the article creator, removes a {{tlx|proposed deletion/dated}} tag from an article <u>during the seven days after the PROD tag was placed</u>, do not replace it,''' even if the tag was apparently removed in [[WP:ABF|bad faith]]. This excludes removals that are clearly not an objection to deletion, such as page blanking or obvious vandalism, and tags removed by [[WP:Banning policy|banned users]] may be restored. If you still believe that the article needs to be deleted, or that the article should be deleted but with discussion, list it on [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion]].</blockquote>

While other workarounds are yet to be found the solution to [[phab:T136688]] and [[phab:T136685]] it will probably be solved by repacing all instances of <nowiki>[h] in TeX/LaTeX (and in MathJax) with [tcb] as [h] is not a valid tag and was seen by the PNG rendering mode as [tcb] but now causes an error in the new mode</nowiki>. I propose that some sort of bot or AWB script is written to automaticaly or semi-automaticaly replace <nowiki>[h] in TeX/LaTeX (and in MathJax) with [tcb]</nowiki> to fix this problem as this was already accepted as the correct solution (pending actual code workarounds) at [[phab:T136685#2345546]].

In the second paragraph at [[WP:BIO1E]], the assassination that led to the start of World War I is given as an example (and the only example) of a "highly significant" event. To me, this suggests that the appropriate bar is whether the event is covered in, or can reasonably expected to be covered in,  history books. Others prefer a lower bar, especially for more recent events, that requires only extensive RS coverage and a subjective assessment of the event's impact—an assessment which often takes a short-term view. They would include events that very likely <u>will not</u> be covered in history books. Should the guideline be modified to clarify this point? If so, how? &#8213;[[User:Mandruss|<span style="color:#775C57;">'''''Mandruss'''''</span>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mandruss|<span style="color:#AAA;">&#9742;</span>]] 19:07, 2 June 2016 (UTC)}}

* such data can be excluded only by including an empty parameter: e.g. {{para|isbn}}.  If the parameter is ''absent'' (rather than ''empty''), inclusion of WikiData will still happen automatically.

Some editors have brought up issues with [[WP:WD|Wikidata]] in infoboxes being included in this way. Should such inclusions continue to be "opt-out"?

This has [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam_Warlock&type=revision&diff=537975092&oldid=537949399 come up before], but [[User:Arionapollo]] has brought this up on [[User talk:Argento Surfer#Adam Warlock|my talk page]] and I thought I'd invite more voices to the table since this could apply to other characters as well.

Basically, the [[Adam Warlock]] publication history currently says "The character debuted in Fantastic Four #66-67 ... [and had] a second appearance as "Him" in Thor #165-166" Arionapollo, citing CGC and Overstreet, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam_Warlock&type=revision&diff=719894035&oldid=719888695 wants to note] the ''Fantastic Four'' issues are a cameo, and specify the character's "first full appearance" as the ''Thor'' issues. However, 
* The FF issues present his origin in full. 
* Old ''Wizard'' magazines note that FF 66 is a cameo, and FF67 is the first appearance. 
* Marvel says his first appearance was [http://marvel.com/universe/Warlock,_Adam FF 66]. 
* There was a 2 year gap between the FF and Thor stories. 

I think the current wording is sufficiently generic, and avoids making a judgment on what's a cameo and what's a true first appearance. Google [https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=adam+warlock+first+appearance+thor+165 provides some additional support] for the Thor books, but all the top hits are from sites promoting the book for its sale value. 

[[Venom (comics)]] gives his first appearance as ASM #300, and specifies in the publication history he appeared in cameo on the last page of #299. 
[[Apocalypse (comics)]] gives his first appearance as X-Factor #5 in the lead, and the infobox specifies #5 was "in shadow" and #6 was "first full appearance". 
The lead and PH of [[Wolverine (character)]] mentions Hulk 180 as his "first appearance" and Hulk 181 as his "first full appearance". The infobox has Hulk 180 listed as a cameo.

# Should the publication history section or infobox distinguish between cameos and first appearances?
# Is this disagreement significant enough to discuss within the article?

It's ridiculous that most experienced editors avoid requesting adminship because they don't want to go through the RfA process. After [[Wikipedia:RFA reform|5 reforms]], no ''major'' changes have been made. I think with a final RfA reform, the process should be completely recreated. Something i'm proposing is the creation of "RfA guidelines", where certain topics cannot be discussed in the RfA (edit count, incidents that occurred 8 years ago, etc.) I think with a new RfA reform, the number of sysops will increase significantly. Additionally, i'm proposing that [[WP:RECALL]] be promoted to policy and be required for all sysops, making it easier for administrators to be desysopped. <span style="font-family:sans-serif; color:red">&mdash; <span style="font-weight:bold">[[User:Music1201|<span style="color:green"> Music1201</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Music1201|<span style="color:red">talk</span>]]</sup></span></span> 22:40, 16 June 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
There seems to be dispute among editors wether or not a given candidate is a "presumptive nominee." For example, a lot of editors think that [[Gary Johnson]] or [[Jill Stein]] should be considered the presumptive nominee of their party, others disagree. I think it would be helpful to reach a consensus on what makes someone a presumptive nominee. 

First, I would like to point out what [[presumptive nominee|our article on presumptive nominees]] says: "a candidate becomes the presumptive nominee of his or her party when his or her last serious challenger drops out or when he or she mathematically clinches—whichever comes first." My interpretation of what this is saying would imply that, for someone to be the presumptive nominee, one of these two things must be:
#He or she has no challenger from his/her same party that is featured in a major poll.
#He/she has obtained 50% or more of his or her party's delegates.
The above seems pretty reasonable to me. However, some editors seem to think differently; they think that a major news agency has to announce him/her the presumptive nominee of their party before Wikipedia does. This disagreement could affect at what point in time should we call [[Hillary Clinton]] the presumptive Democratic nominee, or wether [[Jill Stein]] ''is'' currently the presumptive nominee for the Green Party.

I think it would be helpful for this election and future elections for Wikipedia to have a consensus on what makes a candidate the "presumptive nominee" of their party. --[[User:Proud User|Proud User]] ([[User talk:Proud User|talk]]) 23:21, 29 May 2016 (UTC)}}

I am starting a RfC to gather consensus on how the newly-renamed [[Executive Office (Northern Ireland)]] should be referred to. The department was recently renamed from the '''Office of First Minister and deputy First Minister''' to the Executive Office, but this name is rather generic for use on Wikipedia. Should the department be referred to in the lead of articles as simply the ''Executive Office'' or the ''Executive Office of Northern Ireland''. I'm asking because editors may take issue with a name other than the official name being used to introduce the department. <b>[[User:St170e|st170e]]</b><sup><i><small>[[User talk:St170e|talk]]</small></i></sup> 17:52, 23 May 2016 (UTC)}}

:::::: Requesting additional comments as [[User:Johnbod]] clearly can't read his own comments, which justified initial two reversion through "undue weight" argument that claimed previous articles didn't demonstrate-longstanding relationship. He is now reverting because five decades is apparently not long enough to suit him. Can we get some moderation please? Seems wikipedia editors love changing the goalposts when their original claim (argument:undue weight, rationale: no timeframe mentioned in first two insertions) has been debunked. And don't you dare lie like your hero Rothschilds, [[User:Johnbod]]. You said undue weight, tried to spin the concept I was a conspiracy theorist, to which I produced an article that CONCLUSIVELY states the relationship is AT LEAST fifty years. Not only did you not response (regardless of the three-revert warning), you then choose to revert again even though I produced a new source that met the requirements. {{ping|The Anome}} … unsigned, by [[Special:Contributions/31.208.7.22|31.208.7.22]] 15:41, 15 June 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Following the discussions at [[Talk:Birthright_Israel#Jerusalem.2C_Israel]] and [[User_talk:Debresser#1RR]] I want to open an Rfc about the question "Is Jerusalem in Israel or Palestine?"

After I reverted the removal of "Israel" from "Jerusalem, Israel" in a certain article, I was referred to [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Jerusalem]]. I noticed there that "There was no consensus for any phrasing of Jerusalem’s location in either Israel or Palestine." It does not say what to do. I also noticed that that Rfc was about the [[Jerusalem]] article only, and that it is binding for 3 years only, till July 9, 2016.

My first reaction was that in the absence of any clear consensus on this potentially controversial subject, the only acceptable course of action per Wikipedia policies and guidelines would be to refrain from changing any status quo. Then I cam to the realization that I could also initiate a process to try and establish a project wide consensus on this issue, some guideline on the issue, much like [[WP:WESTBANK]] regarding another related hot potato.

I then did some research. A simple search of Wikipedia teaches that there are 438 instances of "Jerusalem, Palestine" on Wikipedia and 9,268 of "Jerusalem, Israel". I came to the conclusion that that fact proves that both alternatives are considered completely acceptable on Wikipedia, and with a ratio of roughly 1:21 even makes a point for "Jerusalem, Israel" over "Jerusalem, Palestine". Also compare the Google search results, which are 331,000 to 5,950,000, roughly 1:18. I remember from my elementary school in Holland, that there never was any issue that Jerusalem is in Israel. Mind you, I am not talking about [[East Jerusalem]], the status of which is widely acknowledged as ambiguous, just simply "Jerusalem".

Then that same respected editor who pointed me to the Jerusalem Rfc, made another interesting point, namely that there is a difference between <nowiki>[[Jerusalem, Israel]] (or [[Jerusalem, Palestine]], for that matter) and [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]] (or [[Jerusalem]], [[Palestine]])</nowiki>, with the latter being more problematic in his eyes.

I see four general options:
# Replace all instances of "Palestine" by "Israel" (unless specific reference was made to [[[East Jerusalem]]);
# Remove all instances of "Israel" and "Palestine" from after "Jerusalem";
# Keep all instances as they are. This means that no changes will be allowed to whatever is the present version. In the case of a new article, local consensus should decide;
# Refrain from making a guideline and leave it up to local consensus. This option might be rephrased, and I mean this non-judgemental, as keep the present anarchy.

In addition there is an idea that can be implemented independently of whichever of the above options will be chosen:
# Replace all <nowiki>[[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]] and [[Jerusalem]], [[Palestine]] by [[Jerusalem, Israel]] (or [[Jerusalem, Palestine]]</nowiki>, to address at least the most problematic form of this issue.

Please take part in the discussion below, and at the end also express your vote. Please note that I made no discussion section regarding the independent replacement option, because I expect the general discussion to cover this as well.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&type=revision&diff=721868899&oldid=721863210] Material claiming that a source of intelligence information was Russian satellite data intercepted by a Norwegian listening station has been included in the article.  I suggest there a number of problems with this:

1. It is only covered in media outlets, with reference to a single TV report and a report on the TV show itself; effectively the same source.  I cannot find reference to it in any other [[WP:SECONDARY]] source.  Whilst we can look to a media report as a source, this isn't encouraged where it is the only source of data.  We also look to other sources that are considered more reliable.  I would suggest the current reference is inadequate.

2. Coverage in this article is disproportionate, it certainly doesn't merit two paragraphs.

3. The sensationalist terms used in the edit are completely inappropriate, with the suggestion is was somehow "vital" and let the British know where the Argentine navy was at all times.  This contradicts just about every source known on the conflict, which details the problems the British had in locating the Argentine carrier.  In any case the Argentine fleet withdrew to port after the sinking of the Belgrano and played no role in the conflict.

It has been removed on this basis several times, on each occasion removal was reverted with the comment "it is cited" "disagree with removal" but as far as I can see these discrepancies have not been addressed.  I suggest that on the basis laid out above, this is very much [[WP:FRINGE]] material, the coverage here is disproportionate and it should be removed.  <span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User:Wee Curry Monster|W]][[Special:contributions/Wee Curry Monster|C]][[User talk:Wee Curry Monster|M]]</span><sub>[[Special:EmailUser/Wee Curry Monster|email]]</sub> 20:11, 24 May 2016 (UTC)}}

There is [[User:BrightRoundCircle/sandbox/self-sourcing|established consensus]] that examples from popular culture are "not self-sourcing", that is, "'''The source(s) cited should not only establish the verifiability of the pop culture reference, but also its significance.'''"

The article [[Wikipedia:"In_popular_culture"_content#Good_and_bad_popular_culture_references|"In popular culture"]] does elaborate on this, and makes it clear: "'''Although some references may be plainly verified by primary sources, this does not demonstrate the significance of the reference'''" and "'''[examples] should be reserved for major, in-depth treatments of the subject that have had lasting significance'''".

Although this article deals specifically with the "Constitution of Medina," it is my opinion that there is a place to mention, in passing, a similar pact or covenant made by Muhammad to the Jews living in Arabia, since it applies to the right of non-Muslims. 
The most appropriate place to add this small note is in the sub-section, "Rights of Non-Muslims," directly after the bullet which reads:
#Non-Muslims will not be obliged to take part in religious wars of the Muslims.
The edit which we are suggesting would read as follows:

:"In Yemenite Jewish sources, subsequent to the Constitution of Medina, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as ''kitāb ḏimmat al-nabi'', written in the 17th year of the [[Hijri year|Hijra]] (638 CE), and which gave express liberty unto Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks, but were required to pay the [[jizya]] (poll-tax) annually for their protection by their patrons." 
This edit will be backed-up by a footnote which reads:
:"[[Shelomo Dov Goitein]], ''The Yemenites – History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life'' (Selected Studies), editor: Menahem Ben-Sasson, Jerusalem 1983, pp. 288–299. ISBN 965-235-011-7."
If such an edit should be viewed by our fellow co-editors as informative in the general history of relations between non-Muslims, we will add the edit. Thanks in advance. [[User:Davidbena|Davidbena]] ([[User talk:Davidbena|talk]]) 14:08, 27 May 2016 (UTC)}}

I am requesting a comment on the notability of the following sources. I have been trying to establish notability for the Austin Petersen presidential campaign, 2016 and I believe the sources I have provided are reliable independent sources, most especially independent on the topic of Petersen or the Libertarian Party in general. I believe the sources show more than enough notability to qualify for [[WP:GNG]] but some users are claiming the sources are not enough as they claim the sources are not reliable. This is only a small list but I believe they are also disqualifying [[WP:NEXIST]] as there is a lot of other coverage including local coverage. While not all coverage is solely on the topic of Petersen's bid for presidency it does state in [[WP:GNG]] "Significant coverage is more than a trivial mention, but it does not need to be the main topic of the source material."

I believe we are being asked to show an unreasonable amount of sources to show notability. As well [[User:MelanieN]] is indicating that all the sources I listed should never be considered reliable, something that [[WP:IRS]] says is an incorrect statement. Even more so I believe the users denying notability are relying on [[WP:BIO]] when in fact the topic of this page is his campaign, an organization separate to a page on Ausin Petersen himself, and thus requires the use of [[WP:ORG]] and [[WP:GNG]] to establish notability as a campaign is an organization. I believe this page was unreasonably speedily deleted as the page deserves a discussion of it's own on notability.

I would like to propose the repeal of the language in this guideline which forbids the inclusion of image galleries in articles about human ethnic groups. This would bring such articles into conformity with Wikipedia's general practice of attempting to include informative image(s) in articles wherever reasonably possible. Even articles about sub-species groupings directly analogous to human ethnic groups, such as [[Maine Coon]], include images of their subjects.

Possible counter-arguments:
#Classification of people on the basis of ethnic group is offensive. -> Please see [[WP:NOTCENSORED]].
#Where no reliable sources for classification of specific people on the basis of ethnic group can be found, such classifications constitute original research. -> The original research policy [[WP:OI|specifically allows]] the use of original images in articles, even when visual analysis of photo content forms the sole basis for concluding that photos depict their purported subject matter.
#Human ethnic groups have no biological, genetic, or other scientific basis. Therefore, there is no reasonable basis for classifying photos of people as depictions of such groups. -> This argument is flat out wrong, according to "Genetic structure, self-identified race/ethnicity, and confounding in case-control association studies" {{PMID|15625622}}. This particular paper qualifies as a secondary [[WP:RS]] since the authors aren't analyzing data they collected themselves. Note also the approval of [[isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine]] by the FDA, which would have hardly occurred if human ethnicity were not a scientifically definable concept.
#The inherent uncertainty and changes over time in definitions of human ethnic groups creates a class of photos which may or may not depict a particular ethnic group. -> When depicting an ethnic group, we aim for the center, and not the edge.

Full disclosure:
I am opening a discussion about this issue in response to a dispute about whether [[Special:Permalink/680609377|a photo gallery for the White people article with the images I selected]] is appropriate for Wikipedia.

{{Edit request|a}}

I am submitting another request on behalf of Hilton Worldwide as part of my work for Beutler Ink. This request proposes 2 changes to the article's lead.

<hr>
{{Resolved}}

:1. I propose a slight wording change to improve flow, eliminate unnecessary detail (re: Chad), and update the number of rooms.

: Before: {{fontcolor|red|As of January 2016, Hilton Worldwide's portfolio includes 4,610 hotels with over 758,502 rooms. In January 2016, the opening of the Hilton in Chad marked the 100th country Hilton resides in, thus making the corporation the largest hotel chain in the world by rooms and international presence.}}

: After: {{fontcolor|green|As of March 2016, Hilton Worldwide's portfolio includes more than 4,660 properties with over 765,000 rooms in more than 100 countries, making the corporation the largest hotel chain in the world by rooms and international presence.}}

<hr>
{{Resolved}}
:2. Currently, the article's lead says, "The company has been a sponsor of the United States Olympic Team since 2005." This is no longer true. I propose changing the tense, since the company is no longer a sponsor, and moving the sentence from the lead to the article's [[Hilton Worldwide#History|History]] section. This past sponsorship does not seem like something worth mentioning in the lead.

<hr>

Should the last paragraph of the lead be shortened to "'''it is not possible to ''delete'' an account'''."?

''' Reasoning '''

Currently, the last paragraph of the lead reads:

: Due to all contributions being licensed under the [[Wikipedia:Text of Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|CC BY-SA 3.0 License]] and the [[Wikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL]], '''it is not possible to ''delete'' an account'''.

This is disingenuous.  These licenses set out no such requirements.  If we're to put aside community norms for a minute, the reason for not being able to delete accounts is technical; as anybody who's had their username changed would know, the software allows for accounts to be created under a previously-held username.  The theory is, if we were to delete somebody's account, somebody else could register under the same name and assume authorship of the departed user's edits.  There's ways to get around this, but none have been pursued for different reasons; foremost is the community's obsession with requiring editors to identify with only one handle - an obsession that is borne of misguided notions of professionalism.  In any case, I suggest condensing the paragraph down to...

: '''it is not possible to ''delete'' an account'''.

... which is strictly factual.  Izkala ([[User talk:Izkala|talk]]) 01:13, 30 May 2016 (UTC)}}

A short discussion was [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#WP:DATERANGE_again|initially had above]] (the latest of many which went nowhere) regarding the re-introduction of the four-digit endrange year in [[WP:DATERANGE]]. When some support was garnered but discussion again stalled, it was then [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#WP:DATERANGE_ambiguity_and_stylistic_concerns|expanded to a discussion and !vote at the Village Pump]], garnering a high level of agree !votes to return to the original style of allowing—or even preferring—four-digit end years (''i.e. 2000–2016'') instead of the current two-digit end years (''i.e. 2000–16'') for ranges that occur post-11th century and within the same century. 
In addition to the support garnered at the Village Pump, it's becoming clear to me that the general editing public (and likely the general public itself) finds the 2000–16 format disagreeable, as I've already had to revert '''three instances''' ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anton_Yelchin&diff=prev&oldid=727482362],[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anton_Yelchin&diff=prev&oldid=726247993],[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anton_Yelchin&diff=prev&oldid=726090890]) within the last few days of someone changing "2000–16" to "2000–2016" in the infobox for [[Anton Yelchin]] (a high-traffic article due to the subject's recent death).

b) an editor notifies [[WT:COIN]] of that fact and provides the Elance link as proof, people than watch the article that does not yet exist 

c) someone on Elance wins the job, creates a new Wikipedia account, and than creates the article.

Consensus has been for some time that in general, lists of many aircraft types do not include the numbers built for each type. Two editors in particular have now challenged that in the case of lists for aircraft types in a given role. There appear to be three possible ways forward:
#Maintain the broad consensus that production numbers should not be listed.
#Change the broad consensus, to add production numbers to all lists of aircraft in table form.
#Make an exception for role-based lists of aircraft.
(An exception has been agreed for the numbers ''in service'' in lists for a given operator, but that is a different number with a particular rationale).

{{rfcquote|text=
I recently initiated [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#WP:DATERANGE_again|a discussion]] regarding [[WP:DATERANGE]], the MoS guideline that specifies use of two-digit abbreviated years in end-ranges (i.e. 1995–99 instead of 1995–1999) for years from the 11th century onward only. Objections have been raised regarding this guideline before, and now again, with many agreeing with my reasoning for reverting to the old format, but it never proceeds any further. Here are several reasons why the current guideline should be abandoned and reverted:

* Date ranges under the current format can easily be confused for something else entirely, especially for ranges ending in years '01–'12. For example, "2010–12" can easily be interpreted as December 2010 instead of a date range of 2010–2012.
* It looks very unprofessional IMHO. Saving a measly two digits is not worth giving the appearance of using unnecessary shortcuts/slang in a respectable encyclopedia.
* It doesn't read naturally for years in the 21st century spanning the 2000s decade to 2010 or later. This is mainly because years from 2000–2009 are usually pronounced "two thousand and", while years from 2010—present are usually said as "twenty". So a range such as 2000–16 being read as "two thousand to sixteen" sounds ridiculous. This is especially problematic for anyone having Wikipedia read aloud by a text-to-speech program.
* Implementation is inconsistent, since it is only applicable to years 1000 AD+ and to none of the years in the BC era (why not?), leading to more confusion and unnecessary stylistic asymmetry.

I am looking to canvass the wider community to see if there is support to revert to the older style, which <s>preferred</s> permitted the entire 4-digit year for end-ranges. Please indicate whether you support the current MoS guideline or the previous one. — '''[[User talk:Crumpled Fire|<font face="Lucida Fax"><font color="#2695A9">Crumpled Fire</font></font>]]'''<small> • ''[[Special:Contributions/Crumpled Fire|contribs]]'' •</small> 00:43, 18 June 2016 (UTC)}}

If a video game has a “Game of the Year Edition,” or an album has a “Collector’s Edition,” or a movie has a “Director’s Cut” release, should the edition name be italicized as well (per [[MOS:T#Major works]])? Is “Game of the Year Edition” considered a partial title, part of the name of the major work, for instance ''Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception: Game of the Year Edition''? (If so, should we also say “they released a ''Game of the Year Edition''”?) A brief internal search shows italics (and even capitalization) inconsistently applied to such labels, at least in video game articles:
*[[Call of Duty 2]] does not italicize “Special Edition” or “Game of the Year Edition,” and doesn’t even capitalize “a collector’s edition” or “the mobile version”.
*[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]] italicizes “''Game of the Year Edition''” both with the game title (with and without a preceding colon) and on its own, but not “Special Edition Soundtrack.”
*[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]] has “Game of the Year edition” roman with a small E, but italicizes “a ''Collector’s Edition''.”

One of the goals of the Manual of Style is to encourage consistency across WIkipedia. To that end, should [[MOS:T#Major works]] be edited to address this? What should it say? —[[Special:Contributions/67.14.236.50|67.14.236.50]] ([[User talk:67.14.236.50|talk]]) 22:29, 2 June 2016 (UTC)}}

Hi,

[[User:Fountains of Bryn Mawr]] disagrees that [[James Gregory (mathematician)| James Gregory]] had influenced [[Isaac Barrow]], however I provided a very robust document that was a 1916 translation of his work, which clearly showed high praise for Gregory's work.
It seems this user is just against establishing this relationship for some reason. It shouldn't be a surprise that Barrow had respect for gregory, and was influenced by his work, yet Bryn Mawr just can't let it go. I provided sources, and they try to claim a translated document from over 100 years ago, showing mutual respect, is somehow original research. It is not original research at all. Calling "the most learned man" is one of the highest compliments a scholar could pay another when using their work. I'm seeking moderation because the user may risk violating the [[Wikipedia:Edit warring#The three-revert rule|3RR]], and I feel what I've provided is quite compelling. I would have to dig a little more, but I find a translated primary source document containing such a phrase as the most compelling piece of evidence. Secondary accounts often are less convincing. <br>Here is some secondary analysis showing the impact of Gregory's work. Secondary analysis such as [http://physics.ucsc.edu/~michael/barrowleibniz15.pdf] (page 4, footnote 11) also refers to the quote I've used, but builds on it slightly more by also mentioning [[Gottfried Leibniz]]' praise of Gregory's work. So we can see that the work of Gregory impressed both Leibniz and Barrow. To suggest such esteemed scholars (of almost 400 years ago) use phrases like "the most learned man" or "elegant theorem by Gregory" (quite the compliments) without being influenced by them (where such influence is in the form of using their work, at the very least) is unreasonable. I just do not know what the editor wants, and it feels like the evidence provided was sufficient. I will try to find more sources but I do not know how what is already provided isn't sufficient to constitute as evidence for influence.<br>
Here is a letter by a prominent publishing intermediary (between Gregory, Barrow, and Newton) John Collins addressed to Gregory [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Extras/Collins_Newton.html] While the letter itself is somewhat mundane (he met Sir Isaac, had dinner, Sir Isaac said [[Opticks]] was going to continue where Reverend Barrow left off, and that Collins needn't ask about Sir Isaac's publishing commitments because Reverend Barrow said the Lucasian chair had such requirements already), it establishes that, while communication was slow at the time, Collins was clearly acting as a facilitator. Thus, the work of Gregory clearly had an influence on Barrow given that the publisher was writing about their progress to the former. Trying to find more.<br>
Here is another secondary source, [http://gec.ncut.edu.tw/teacher/math/homepage/liu_pohong/teach_class2_download.php?sn=14 The Historical Development of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus And Its Implication in Teaching]: <blockquote>Apparently, Fermat reduced a problem of rectification by connecting tangents and
the question of quadratures. Surprisingly, for all his deft use of infinitesimals in a variety of areas, he still failed to recognize this critical relation, denying himself the honored title of “true inventor of the calculus” (Boyer, 1959). The man first overtly aware of generality of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus was James Gregory in 1668, exerting a significant influence on Isaac Barrow’s work.</blockquote>
So I have to ask, why is [[Fountains of Bryn Mawr]] picking a fight over something that seems to be the consensus? Note: I am not talking about assigning priority/credit for the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (which is clearly a bit more involved), but the '''influence''' of their investigations on eachother's work. Clearly assigning priority of the fundamental theorem is difficult because their collaboration (facilitated by Collins where appropriate) muddled the "who did what" part.<br>
Found probably the most definitive scholarly literature on this issue, however, again, I must emphasise that the focus of these scholars is much more than that:
<blockquote>
Barrow's heavy "borrowings" include his restatement of "Gregory's generalization of Wren's proof of a construction for the tangent at a general point on a cyclid arc," as well as his appropriation of Gregory's "rectifying transformation," the basis of the Scot's ''involutio'' and ''evolutio'' method. Even barrow's most famous achievement--the proof for the inverse nature of differentiation and integration--was now reinterpreted as a "neat amendment of Gregory's generalization of Neil's rectification method." - Mordechai Feingold<ref>{{cite journal| last=Feingold|first=Mordechai| url=https://keats.kcl.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/1346678/mod_resource/content/4/Feingold.pdf| title= Newton, Leibniz, and Barrow Too: An Attempt at a Reinterpretation | year=1993| volume=84|page=310-338|journal=[[Isis (journal)]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] on behalf of [[History of Science Society]]}}(page 332)</ref></blockquote>

If you dig further into that cited passage, you will find references to [[Tom Whiteside| DT Whiteside]]<ref>{{cite journal| last=Whiteside|first=Derek Thomas| title=Patterns of Mathematical Thought in the later Seventeenth Century| url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/41133216.pdf| doi=10.1007/BF00327940| journal= Archive for History of Exact Sciences | volume=1|issue=3|publisher=[[Springer]]|pages=179-388|year=1961}}</ref> who argues this line of thinking. However, again, we are not discussing ''priority'' of the fundamental theorem, nor are we discussing ''originality''. What we are discussing is whether it is reasonable to infer that Gregory's work influenced Barrow, and given the in-depth analyses of these scholars (admittedly focusing on originality and priority for the fundamental theorem of calculus), it is hard to argue against, at the very least, the idea that Gregory's work did influence Isaac Barrow.

{{rfcquote|text=
With DC Comics' reintroduction of "Captain Marvel" as part of their "New 52" revamp in 2012, he was officially renamed "Shazam", a name that is used not only in the comics but in the character's subsequent appearances in other media. As a result, for the last four years, the lead and infobox for this article have been in a constant state of flux; I have seen each of the following as the lead sentence - back and forth - over the years:
:'''''Captain Marvel''', is a fictional superhero who appears in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]].''
:'''''Captain Marvel''', also known as '''Shazam''', is a fictional superhero who appears in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]].''
:'''''Shazam''', also known as '''Captain Marvel''', is a fictional superhero who appears in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]].''

The infobox has been in more of a state of flux than the lead - attempts have been made to acknowledge both names - i.e. "Shazam (Captain Marvel)" - in the header, but this again has been constantly edited back and forth, often without attribution. My proposal is that the infobox match whatever the choice for the lead will be, either ''"Captain Marvel"'', ''"Captain Marvel (Shazam)"'', or ''"Shazam (Captain Marvel)"''.

This is mostly the result of longtime fans being upset with the renaming of the character; a situation which doesn't appear to be all that reversible given [[Marvel Comics]]' increasing promotion and use of ''their'' [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] ([[Carol Danvers]]) in their comics and in an upcoming [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film. This was the key impetus for the name change in the first place.

This issue may also affect the naming of the article itself - that is, whether or not it needs to be renamed "[[Shazam (DC Comics)]]" or "[[Shazam! (DC Comics)]]". There also may need to be discussion about to do with [[Shazam (character)]], which redirects to [[Shazam (wizard)]], the article about the hero's wizard benefactor, as well as (eventually) the articles for [[Marvel Family]], [[Mary Marvel]] and [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]]. --[[User:FuriousFreddy|FuriousFreddy]] ([[User talk:FuriousFreddy|talk]]) 23:39, 6 June 2016 (UTC)}}

Some of the people who mill "influenced" aren't worthy. One individual who immediately comes to mind is Kruggy poo, aka Kruggsternator, aka Krugger, paul krugman.

this is getting ridiculous and embarrassing. is wikipedia being used as a way to help nobodies get opportunities they otherwise wouldn't? look at how long the list of "influenced" is! this is longer than [[John Stuart Mill]] who is also a giant. this list needs to be reduced, and to suggest that it doesn't is incorrect. i didnt make a fuss about someone changing the infobox back to "philosophy" because his supervisor [[Edward John Routh]] (a MATHEMATICIAN) was still acknowledged. what is with you "arts kids" on wikipedia? did Whitehead have some exceptional philosophical discourse? of course! however, he was a MATHEMATICIAN. look at some of these references for the "influenced" is hilarious (see reference "CPS Co-Directors", Center for Process Studies, accessed December 12, 2013, http://www.ctr4process.org/about/CoDirectors/. for [[Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki]]). 
:the number of people in this "influenced" box only insult the legacy that was supposed to be left for OUR GUY, the great whitehead. if this was that loser [[bertrand russell]]'s (caveat: i must admit his work was crucial to me "blossoming" though, as it ensured i was "nurtured" throughout my public K-12 education<ref>see [[Genius#Philosophy]]. "Russell's philosophy further maintains, however, that it is possible for such geniuses to be crushed in their youth and lost forever when the environment around them is unsympathetic to their potential maladaptive traits."</ref>), i wouldn't be making as much of a fuss. so can we get some cooperation in lopping off this list? it's way too long and unfair. as was mentioned by another individual in the [[Talk:John Stuart Mill]], many people were influenced by people like Whitehead or Mill. However, that doesn't mean they should all get equal mention. this list is outrageously long and only dilutes his impact.

There is general consensus that the text should not necessarily have its own section header on its own merits. While there is consensus for adding some information regarding this news item, the current text did not have consensus. To (grossly) generalise: While the references (such as The Washington Post) may have noted this information, the text in question does not show what the references state as to '''why''' they noted this information, so ''as written'' this appears to the reader as "trivia". So, while keeping policy ([[WP:BLP]], [[WP:V]], [[WP:OR]], etc.) in mind, there is no prejudice against starting a new RfC to determine what that text should be, and which section it should be grouped under (including the possibility of a whole new section, if deemed appropriate). Note: The arbcom restriction noted at the top of this page still applies, so initially [[WP:BOLD|boldly]] adding such text would likely be seen as disruptive and likely trigger sanction. - <b>[[User:Jc37|jc37]]</b> 09:19, 9 July 2016 (UTC)}}

Following a month long trial (9 May - 9 June inclusive) that was regarded as successful by most commenters based on objective and subjective measures (read this page for the full background), this RfC seeks to establish whether the criteria for the "Recent deaths" section of the "In the news" section of the main page, listed at [[Wikipedia:In the news#Recent deaths]] ([[WP:ITN/DC]]), should be changed to match those used during the trial.

'''Question:''' Should the proposal detailed below be implemented?
{{divbox|plain|Proposal|
'''The existing criteria for a recent deaths listing:'''
*The deceased was in a high-ranking office of power at the time of death and/or had a significant contribution/impact on the country/region.
*The deceased was widely regarded as a very important figure in his or her field.
'''are replaced by:'''<br />
The deceased has a Wikipedia article that is:
#Not currently nominated for deletion or speedy deletion.
#Of sufficient quality to be posted on the main page, as determined by a consensus of commenters.
}}
No other changes to the section at [[Wikipedia:In the news#Recent deaths section]] are proposed. These changes do not alter the criteria, standards or conventions for blurbs, including blurbs for people who have recently died.
 
If this proposal is successful it will apply to all nominations made from the UTC day after the RfC is closed (e.g. if this is closed on the 18 June it will apply from 19 June). [[User:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] ([[User talk:Thryduulf|talk]]) 12:32, 11 June 2016 (UTC)}}

When an article is [[WP:PROD|proposed for deletion]], the PROD tag sits on the article and the article gets deleted after 1 week of no opposition. However, any editor who later disagrees with the deletion may [[WP:UND|request for undeletion]]. When an AfD discussion receives no comments after a week of being open, it is generally relisted to gain higher participation. Usually AfD discussions are relisted a maximum of two times, after which the discussion is usually closed as [[WP:SOFTDELETE]], meaning that any user may request for its undeletion without going through a [[WP:DRV|deletion review]]. Discussion venues such as [[WP:RFD]] and [[WP:RM]] follow [[WP:NOQUORUM]], in that nominations which have received no opposition after a week are deleted (in the case of RFD) or moved (in the case of RM). I cannot see why AfD should be treated differently from PROD. Generally speaking, AfD is monitored by more editors than PROD, meaning that an AfD uncontested after being opened for more than one week should have gotten more attention than an article which has been PRODed for a week. I propose that AfD discussions which have been open for more than a week (168 hours) without any "keep" votes (policy-based or not) be closed as soft delete, provided that the article has never been proposed for deletion or soft deleted in the past. This means that the article is deleted but any user, for any reason, may request for its undeletion at [[WP:UND]] instead of gaining consensus at [[WP:DRV]].

The article cites several sources that I would like some informed opinions on in the context of [[WP:RS]] in a [[WP:BLP]] article.  These seem problematic:

* "The Lordship of Castleshort" [http://home.earthlink.net/~rggsibiba/html/castleshort/castleshort.html] - And simple Earthlink site published by Shortt himself.  This makes it a [[WP:SELFPUBLISH|self-published source]], which normally are not acceptable (especially in this case; most other sources seem to show a lot of it is untrue)
*  "Ryoi Shintô Ryû Clubs Worldwide" [https://web.archive.org/web/20131112024747/http://www.rsrjujutsu.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=29] - Also seems to be a [[WP:SELFPUBLISH|self-published website]] by Shortt himself.
*  www.ibabodyguards.com - While this is an organization, it's also Shortt's business and it reads as though he either wrote it himself or at least has direct control over it's content, which would make it another [[WP:SELFPUBLISH|self-published source]].
*  "Irish Chiefswatch" [http://homepage.eircom.net/%257Eseanjmurphy/chiefs/chiefswatch.htm] and "Niadh Nask: An Alleged Irish Order of Knighthood" [http://homepage.eircom.net/%257Eseanjmurphy/chiefs/niadhnask.htm] - Both part of the [[WP:SELFPUBLISH|Self-published website]] of Sean J Murphy, an alleged genealogist (or something) who was allegedly threatened by Shortt.  He actually references Wikipedia and other wikis in the site.
*  The two [[Private Eye]] articles, "Soldiers of misfortune" and "A Shortt story" - Two problems.  1) There are no links to them and I cannot find them on Private Eye's site or anywhere else online. At present, I cannot verify what they said or if they even exist. 2) Prviate Eye is a ''satire'' magazine, somewhat like the American [[National Enquirer]], and so I am unclear if they are considered reliable sources in general.
*  The three [[The_Phoenix_(magazine)|Phoenix]] articles - same problems as Private Eye above, far as I can tell.
*  BudoExpress Interview - Can't find this anywhere.
*  The Dundalk Leader article - Can't find this anywhere either, not even a mention on a forum post.

[[User:Signedzzz]] has done some fantastic work on this page recently, pulling it up to GA status. However, I notice that there are still some significant omissions to the content; there is no section discussing Dilling's personal life or personality for instance, and no wider discussion of her political views or ideology. Moreover, the lead does not aptly summarise the rest of the article, as is required in [[WP:Lede]] (Contrast, for example, this article with that of other political figures like [[Else Christensen]] or [[Vladimir Lenin]]). Thus, this evening I have gone back to the reliable sources, and used them as part of a project to add these sections into the article and to ensure that on the whole it is more thoroughly sourced. 

Unfortunately, Signedzzz has simply undone almost all of my additions, often not giving any explanation in their edit summaries and barely responded to my Talk Page comments. In my opinion, this smacks of [[Wikipedia:Ownership of content|WP:Ownership]], which I think is completely unwarranted in this situation. I'm more than happy to work with them in improving the article, but at this stage I think it is best if I take it to RfC to see what other people have to say. Do I have a point?

I am making this request due to a discussion I initiated [[Talk:The_Phantom_Tollbooth#Plot_section_in-universe_problem|here]]. The discussion centered on whether the in-universe template should be applied to the article on the [[The Phantom Tollbooth]], which happens to be a featured article. My understanding of [[MOS:PLOT]] and [[MOS:INUNIVERSE]] is that the entire article, including in a plot summary section, should be written in an out-of-universe perspective, and therefore this article should be changed to fix this. To me, it seems that there are a few possibilities:
<ol> 
  <li>I am misinterpreting the plot summary in [[The Phantom Tollbooth]], and it isn't in the in-universe perspective.</li>
  <li>I am misinterpreting the guidelines at [[MOS:PLOT]] and [[MOS:INUNIVERSE]], and it is acceptable to write in an in-universe style, as long as it is within a plot summary section.</li>

The question asked above is valid and deserving of a valid answer. The talk page did not generate enough discussion to achieve that answer so this RfC is the next logical step. It is requested that participants read the level 2 discussion above for the entire background of this dispute. The request essentially asks: Should the [[WP:RS]] examples of plagiarism against Led Zeppelin be included in this article? If so, should that information be presented in its own section of the article? and is the article's current form which mentions plagiarism without specific details adequate?

given the recent addition by [[User:Look2see1]] of the categories "american x", i thought it'd be good to take this to the talk page.

can anyone provide some proof that Emmy Noether was an american citizen, not simply a resident who was there to teach?

i'm not disputing the possibility she was an american, but it just seems weird for someone to add those categories without proof. google's first few pages don't really turn up anything incontrovertible to support this idea, either.

hopefully those who are well-versed in this area can shed some light.

 Our current minimum for featured pictures is "a minimum of 1500 pixels in width and height" with some exceptions. Considering the continuing increases in the quality and size of digital photographs even from smartphone cameras, and the trend toward [[4K UHD]] (3840 x 2160) displays, should we make the following changes:
# increase the minimum size for still images to "3840 pixels x 2160 pixels ([[4K UHD]]), with the height and width interchangeable", and
# change the exception of "Animations and video may be somewhat smaller." to "Animations and video must be a minimum of [[full HD]] (1920 x 1080), with the height and width interchangeable. Exceptions to the minimum may be made for historical, technically difficult or otherwise unique images, if no higher resolution could realistically be acquired."?

The full set of revised size criteria would read:

"It is of sufficiently high resolution to allow quality print reproduction. 
* Still images should be a minimum of 3840 pixels x 2160 pixels ([[4K UHD]]), with the height and width interchangeable; larger sizes are generally preferred. Further information on image size can be found [[Wikipedia:Featured picture criteria/Image size|here]].

Hi! At the suggestion of [[User:Electricburst1996]], I'm requesting comment on edit number [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pendant_Productions&oldid=725565717 725565717]. As of current, there is an ongoing dispute between myself, {{ping|Spshu}}, and {{ping|Electricburst1996}} regarding this edit and our ongoing discussions about it can be read on our User Talk pages [[User_talk:Bmanpa#Pendant_Productions_issues|here]], [[User_talk:Spshu#Pendant_Productions|here]], and [[User_talk:Electricburst1996#Pendant_Productions|here]]. I'm seeking neutral insight into this situation to help us resolve the issue with cool heads.

Paramount to the discussion is an insistence by [[User:Spshu]] that the sources noted in the current revision do not constitute notoriety. It is my opinion that between [[BBC Radio 4]] coverage, a publishing deal with [[Valiant Comics]], several [[Parsec Awards|Parsec Award]] wins, and multi-million download numbers from a the early days of podcasting (When such things were more rare. The sources for this were removed by Spshu because they were Primary Sources.), notoriety is firmly established. His criteria of notoriety includes needing an abundance of coverage by major media (as opposed to New Media sources), which is not a standard being required of any Wikipedia pages of similar material, nor is it a guideline set forth in [[WP:PSTS]]. (Please see [[Earwolf]], [[Maximum Fun]], and [[Nerdist Industries]] for examples similar to this page.) 

As you can see in my edits from 14 June, I attempted to solve this problem by following the [[WP:UNDUE]] and [[WP:PRIMARY]] guidelines, but Spshu did not deem this sufficient and deleted much of the edit against the guidelines of [[WP:DR]]

Also of issue is the Infobox formatting, which is making use of < small > tags. Small tags are currently in use on Infoboxes for major corporate Wikipedia pages, including [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. Unless the formatting on those pages is incorrect, it appears his insistence over not using Small tags constitutes a personal preference (see [[WP:IDLI]]).--[[User:Bmanpa|Bmanpa]] ([[User talk:Bmanpa|talk]]) 02:13, 18 June 2016 (UTC)}}

On the page [[Disney Media Distribution]], a user just changed the type from type = [[Public company|Public]] [[subsidiary]] to type = [[subsidiary]] of [[The Walt Disney Company]]

I know that's wrong, since there's a separate field for parent, but I wanted to confirm what should be in the type field.  

The description page for [[Template:Infobox company]] describes the Type field as follows:

;Type of company, wikilinked where possible. To list percentages owned of a private company, use the ownership parameter (see below).
;Examples: 
;• [[Public company|Public]]
;• [[Privately held company|Private]]

So it's clear that the type can be public or private, but what are the other options?  It would be great to link the template to all the options.  There is a list here <nowiki>[[Category:Types of business entity]]</nowiki>, but the word Type in the [[Template:Infobox company]] infobox is wikilinked to the [[Types of business entity]] article.  That article doesn't really help users understand the type field.

Can we do two things: wikilink the description of the Type field in [[Template:Infobox company]] to <nowiki>[[Category:Types of business entity]]</nowiki>, instead of [[Types of business entity]], and change the wikilinking of the word Type in the [[Template:Infobox company]] template to go to <nowiki>[[Category:Types of business entity]]</nowiki>?  And, while we're at it, shouldn't entity be plural, since types is plural, i.e. Types of business entities?[[User:Timtempleton|Timtempleton]] ([[User talk:Timtempleton|talk]]) 19:26, 6 July 2016 (UTC)}}

Is this "black holes have no hair" statement related to the "hairy ball" observation?  A "hairy ball" (e.g. the physiscist's standard spherical vacuum-racing hamster) ''cannot'' have all of the hair smoothed down perfectly flat. In at least two points ("[[boojum]]s" if you'd like more physics-related neologisms) the hair must either come to either a radial point, or a point of extreme curl. As such points aren't observable from outside the event horizon, we can infer that there's no "hair" on a black hole, where this "hair" analogy can be extended to a number of forms of possible "texture" in its surface.

Hi there,

A few users and I are having trouble agreeing on the best photo to use as a portrait for Bernie Sanders's template.

There seems to be some disagreement regarding discussion above about controversial coverage of the subject of this [[WP:BLP]]. Looking at the article, it seems that fully half of it is the controversy section, which does not appear to be in line with the spirit of [[WP:CSECTION]], and might be treading on shaky [[WP:NPOV]] ground.   

Unfortunately, I know basically nothing about the subject and so I'm opening this to hopefully attract some uninvolved editors who might be better qualified. Also posting a link on WikiProject:India. Feel free to post on other WikiProjects that might be related.

{{rfcquote|text=
Currently, biographical articles of knights and baronets begin with "Sir Firstname Lastname". Wikipedia convention dictates that the person's name at the beginning of a biographical article should be in bold. Most such articles (around 95%) bold "Sir" as well, but a minority of such articles do not bold the "Sir". It goes something like this:

'''Sir John Major''' (born 29 March 1943...
vs.

Sir '''John Major''' (born 29 March 1943...

I want to make it clear that this is not about renaming articles, but about the first mention of the subject's name in the body of the article.

I have been editing certain articles to bold "Sir" as part of the name. I do so for the following reasons:

1) This is the style prescribed by [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biographies]]. The relevant section reads as follows:
"The honorific titles Sir, Dame, Lord and Lady are included in the initial reference and infobox heading for the subject of a biographical article, but are optional after that. '''The title is placed in bold in the first use of the name.'''" (Emphasis added).

2) This is the logical style. "Sir" is part of a person's legal name: it is used not only socially, but in official documents as well. To not bold "Sir" is to imply that is is not part of the subject's name.

3) It is long-standing Wikipedia practice. As previously indicated, 95% of the articles surveyed so far bold "Sir".

I would also like to quote from the MOS, where it is stated that its purpose is to "achieving visual and textual consistency in biographical articles and in biographical information in other articles; such consistency allows Wikipedia to be used more easily". Hence, this is not a case of (say) preferring 'colour' over 'color', but is part of keeping a basic degree of consistency across articles so as to improve usability.

[[User:PBS]] is against the bolding of the prefix in articles' body and asked that I refrain from editing them until a consensus emerges. He will no doubt wish to set out his arguments below. We would be grateful for any comments editors might have on the subject.

is the choice of C really ''arbitrary''?

theoretically speaking, let us say we have a three dimensional euclidean space where each point in this space is independent of the other.
if we were to integrate or differentiate with respect to time, would one not want a unique constant C that essentially facilitate calculation using a two-dimensional approach (a la [[Lebesgue integration]])?
:let us say that we have some discretisation LxWxH (resulting in LWH independent points)
:if we had LWH primes, would these primes not also act as a sort of "unique key" (C) that would make it easier to integrate? 

i admit this but one obscure scenario, but it seems we would ''want'' the constant (ideally, systematically) selected such that it satisfies some rigorous conditions, no? 
probably gonna get mad crickets so w/e. thought i'd throw it out there. <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/174.3.155.181|174.3.155.181]] ([[User talk:174.3.155.181|talk]]) 03:22, 6 July 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serial_killer&diff=726283375&oldid=726213600 This edit] shows the dispute in question. One view is that beginning the lead with "three or more" violates NPOV, or, more specifically, [[WP:NPOV]]. This is based on the viewpoint that "three or more" is "inexplicably trying to declare, in the voice of the encyclopaedia, that a particular definition is correct." and that "As the article clearly states, there is no unique definition, and we have no business pretending there is.  Even if three is the most common, you do not have the right to state that as ''the'' definition."

The other view is that "the [[WP:NPOV]] policy is about [[WP:Due weight]]; it is about giving most of the weight to what is prevalent in the literature. On Wikipedia, it is common to give due weight to the most prevalent definition first, and then present alternative definitions." [[Atheism]] and [[Pedophilia]] are two examples. "Being neutral on Wikipedia does not mean what being neutral means in common discourse; it means following the sources with due weight." Use of "several" in this case is not accurate since "several" is commonly defined as "more than two but not many," when various serial killers have killed many. And "stating 'at least two' is giving undue weight to the 'two or more' definition, which is not as common as the 'three or more definition'."

For those seeing this from the RfC page or a talk page via an alert, full commentary can be seen at [[Talk:Serial killer#NPOV]]. Sources are also provided there. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 07:11, 21 June 2016 (UTC)}}

Hello, everyone.

I think a bold change by yours truly, and a couple of forth and back reverts by our esteemed colleagues {{u|Redrose64}}, {{u|JoeHebda}} and {{u|Moxy}} has very well demonstrated that we need to discuss this issue: Must {{tl|portal bar}} appear in "See also" section, or along with navboxes?

Argument in favor of "See also" section:
# That's where portal links, such as {{tl|Portal}} and {{tl|Portal-inline}} appear. Why should {{tl|Portal bar}} be exempt?

Argument in favor of navboxes section:
# Visually, {{tl|Portal bar}} fits better with navboxes
# Navboxes contain internal links strictly; but they don't appear in "See also" section either, in order to suppress the effects of link bombing.
# {{tl|Portal bar}}, like most navboxes, does not appear in the print, again for the same reason.
# Some navboxes, such as {{tl|Microsoft}} have portal links as well, so portals do not strictly appear in "See also" section anyway

it's possible one could "cobble together" a definition from Rudin's discussion, but i find it lacking. i tried finding a copy of [[Pavel Aleksandrov]]'s combinatorial topology (volume three seems really really nifty), to no avail.

wondering if anyone here has some good recommendations for books touching on functional analysis and duality? {{ping|Zfeinst}} (never thought i'd see this day, did you? lollll): got any good recommendations?

any advice would be great. right now this section is poorly sourced, and if i wasn't familiar with the concept (i learned them through [[Fenchel conjugate]]s), i would have put a request for deletion (exaggerating, sorta).

I'm boldly opening this RfC regarding the two threads above. I think at this point tensions have run high enough that a simple third opinion will be insufficient to establish a solid consensus to which either side will acquiesce.

The timeline being discussed can be seen above. It should be noted that the timeline has been on the article for a sufficient amount of time for it to become the status quo, and the question at hand as such, is whether the timeline should be removed, and not whether it should be included. Per [[WP:NOCON]], a lack of consensus for removal should normally result in the timeline remaining in the article.

I reckon that cases where subpages should not be moved are exceptional, whereas moving subpages is the routine expected behaviour. It's easy to overlook the relevant check box, especially when moving an article page where the only subpages are archives of its Talk page. Catching those archives after the fact can be burdensome and error-prone when there are many such subpages (see [[Talk:Syrian civil war]] for a recent case).
Therefore I suggest that the option labeled "Move subpages" or "Move subpages of talk page" should be checked by default. Opinions welcome. — [[User:JFG|JFG]] <sup>[[User talk:JFG|talk]]</sup> 09:29, 6 July 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The sexual harassment section of this BLP continues to be contentious on certain points.  Currently there seem to be 2 citations in question.  The first is to a blog article at Scientific American, where the Living Person (Karen Stollznow) made claims about sexual harassment.  That is the foundation of this section.  But Scientific American deleted that blog article shortly after publishing it without comment and it exists now only at internet archive.  So does that source still meet the BLP-level requirements for a reliable source, especially considering Scientific Amercican no longer stands behind it?

The second is a response citation to this article, where the head of the organization she accused gives his response.  Is that a self-published source, and does it meet the same requirements needed?

And finally, the whole section is basically about Stollznow making this claim, and the claim being denied.  There have been other links to court documents and twitter documents, which have been removed due to their ineligibility here.  So is what is left a reasonable item for this BLP?  Does the weak sourcing lean toward [[WP:BLPGOSSIP]] or [[WP:BLPCRIME]]? It would be great to get some other comments here!

Ever since the last RfC concluded Pop was going to be the genre, and the only genre for [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_(Taylor_Swift_album)&oldid=686351742 the current revision of Red], there have been numerous discussions, edit wars and complaints. Even though a lot of them were inaccurate (using the nomination for Best Country Album at the Grammy's or Swift claiming it's country as an argument), the essence of the rejection is in the right place, so I started a RfC. 

The genre of an album page on Wikipedia is not like iTunes, in which it is considered which genre section the album fits in best. It is supposed to give a good overview of the genres present on the album. I am not trying to change the genre from pop to country so I am not dismissing the previous RfC. However, I do think that country and rock should be added as genres to give a good overview of the actual content on the CD. Since pop will be the first genre, which usually indicates the genre most present on an album, it will still showcase a transition in comparison to the previous albums of Swift (going from Country to Country pop to Country pop • pop rock to Pop • country • rock to Pop • dance-pop • synthpop).

So should the current revision being kept or changed? [[User:Bjork138|Bjork138]] ([[User talk:Bjork138|talk]]) 20:20, 29 June 2016 (UTC)}}

hi guys,

want to put out a feeler for the appetite to merge [[separable sigma algebra]] into [[sigma algebra]]. i feel the former could be slotted in under a subsection of the latter.

hopefully this is not too radical? the page for separable sigma algebra is quite bare and i think merging into sigma algebra will improve its exposure.

thoughts? [[Special:Contributions/174.3.155.181|174.3.155.181]] ([[User talk:174.3.155.181|talk]]) 21:40, 29 June 2016 (UTC)}}

I think we need to stop arguing over the theoretical hierarchy of knowledge/authority, it is not source based and therefore cannot be used by either side to justify and back-up their argument. We need this discussion to be purely source based, state what a source actually states, not what a vague statement could mean. It is my view that DWM is very open to interpretation, but that is not source based, just like assuming who the official website is sourcing, we don't know who they are sourcing, but they are as reliable as a source can get and it is not open to interpretation, the official website has remained constant in their classification of episodes, whereas DWM has changed their view several times (one time (issue #489) they took a view which was not representative of official designation, referring to TGWD and TWWL as a two-parter), an indicating that it is more their opinion than actual fact, something with DWM is we don't know what Moffat said to them, for all we know they could be misinterpreting him, we can't be sure, while we have a statement from issue #493, that was before the episodes aired and Moffat was likely being purposely vague to keep people in the dark about the episodes, we don't have a post-broadcast statement from Moffat, issue #495 does not quote him, and therefore it cannot be used on the grounds that Moffat shares that view, even if he does, Moffat's personal opinion doesn't necessarily constitute official designation.

One concern is that "It should be very clear to readers that 'eidetic images' (in psychology) and 'photographic memory' are not the same things. Photographic memory does '''not''' exist, and eidetic images are generally not found in adults and they don't allow people to perform spectacular memory feats. [...] 'Eidetic imagery' in psychology is not 'photographic memory' -- it refers to the brief impression of an image that children sometimes see, and it has '''nothing to do with adults who memorize things'''. There is no science to support that." The other concern is that "'''most of the sources [...] are clear that the terms are used interchangeably''' or that photographic memory and eidetic memory '''are''' the same topic, but that the term ''eidetic memory'' is more accurate; if they distinguish photographic memory and eidetic memory at all, it's only slightly. In other words, sources usually treat these topics side by side and as the same thing while other sources distinguish them or slightly distinguish them."

So the issue is this: Should we be strict in stating that eidetic memory and photographic memory are not the same thing? Or should we should initially treat the terms as the same thing, with "photographic memory" as the [[WP:Alternative title]], and then relay that the terms are sometimes distinguished? Sources for examining the terminological matter are below. If viewing this from the RfC page or an alert on your talk page, the full discussion starts at [[Talk:Eidetic memory#Eidetic vs. photographic]].  I will alert [[WP:WikiProject Psychology]] and [[WP:Biology]] to this discussion.

While eidetic imagery is most likely the source of the concept of a photographic memory, there are differences in the two concepts. An eidetic image fades soon after one sees the original image and does not stay with a person over time. The image is subjective, and the details of greatest interest to the person are the ones most easily reproduced. Moreover, a person cannot form an eidetic image in one second, as a camera can snap a photo; several seconds are required to scan the picture. Once the picture has faded away, eidetic images cannot be retrieved. Those who can form eidetic images do not seem to be able to use their special ability to improve long-term memory.}}

But a true photographic memory in this sense has never been proved to exist. Most of us do have a kind of photographic memory, in that most people's memory for visual material is much better and more detailed than our recall of most other kinds of material.

Have linked him as notable alumni to schools and notable professor for Alliant with link backs.  Can't link to his high school at the current time because it is locked by an admin temporary. Will get with an admin to add him there and then will remove the tag of orphan article.  

''' proposed deletion by admin SwisterTwister asking for help on how to show this doctor is the head of his department, has chapters in textbooks used nationally and how to add research papers published. '''

Hello, I'm writing because as of today you put a tag on the article about Glenn S. Lipson saying the page should be deleted.  He is the director at Alliant University for the forensic psychologist dept. I placed that under Notable Alumni for Alliant University as well as what he works on that they put out as  Alliant Spotlights and wrote a whole summary of what he does and what he researches.  I also connected under Alliant his listing as the department head and his interests and research.  Each of the books listed that he contributed are text books.  He writes a lot of chapters in text books that are used nationally in other universities.  Any specific suggestions you can make as to showing all of this without using the PR release by Alliant University under their "spotlights" would be greatly appreciated.  

I was about to begin helping with other waiting psychologists pages waiting for help that needed to be added to Wikipidia but obviously I need to learn more of what is required first.  It was suggesting I not use links to his research papers because they weren't in text books and he did have chapters in multiple text books used today.

I' cross posting this on the talk page for my user page so I can get other help if you are busy this weekend.

Many thanks.

A request is hereby made for other editors to examine various points in dispute in the discussion above where two editors are deadlocked, and then determine, for each point, which view is persuasive, or whether additional argument is needed for resolution. Note that for [[#Item d: removal of "natural time" material as being fringe]] the precise issue is of notability.

(I caution any casual or fly-by commentators that some of these points involve scientific issues for which proper consideration requires examination of external sources; time spent on examination and consideration will enhance the quality of your comments.)

'''Background''': The discussion above concerns a series of edits being repeatedly made in two sections ([[Earthquake_prediction#Electromagnetic_variations]] and [[Earthquake_prediction#1987–1995: Greece (VAN)]]) that touch upon the group (and work) known as "VAN". (And related to similar edits at [[VAN method]].) These questioned edits are entirely from anonymous IP addresses that geolocate to Athens, Greece: first from [[Special:Contributions/195.134.89.153|195.134.89.153]] (and specifically from the University of Athens, home of VAN) and [[Special:Contributions/77.69.86.91|77.69.86.91]], then (since 5 June) from [[Special:Contributions/77.69.80.202|77.69.80.202]]. In general, I dispute these edits on the basis of neutrality, weight, and possible conflict of interest, while 77.69.80.202 complains that the existing text (as well as added text) was negative, "POV-pushing", and "muting" of support. ~ [[User:J.

So I guess we're ignoring wiki BRD policy on this page?  The unsourced assertion that assault rifles were first used in ww2 is not the consensus view, nor is the assertion that the germans were the first to pioneer the assault rifle concept during world war 2.  "The research led to an article published in the NRA Journal for the American Arms Collector, Man at Arms, (Vol. 13, No. 1, January/February 1991), titled The Burton Balloon Buster by William B. Edwards. Mr. Edwards emphatically asserted that this was indeed the first true assault rifle; developed in 1917. The father of this remarkable weapon was none other than Frank B. Burton, the noted engineer who worked with John Browning on the first BAR." http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=121   Other experts argue that the first was the federov avtomat.  There is no consensus among experts that assault rifles were first used in ww2, and there is no consensus among experts that germans were the first to pioneer the assault rifle concept.  I'd support a change to saying that the germans pioneered the sturmtruppen tactics in world war 2, and so it could be said that germany pioneered new tactics based around the assault rifle, sturmgewehr, but it seems like the germans pioneered sturmtruppen tactics at the end of world war 1.[[User:TeeTylerToe|TeeTylerToe]] ([[User talk:TeeTylerToe|talk]]) 11:06, 3 July 2016 (UTC)}}

hi guys,

i know on the surface this proposition may seem unrelated, but wouldn't satisfying properties of strict monotonicity also implicitly satisfy both the [[vertical line test|vertical]] and [[horizontal line test|horizontal]] line tests?

i understand in the case of non-strict monotonicity (i.e. strictly non-decreasing or non-increasing) can introduce a scenario where <math>t_1 < t_2</math>, and <math>f(x_{t_1}) = f(x_{t_2})</math>, thereby violating the horizontal line test, but couldn't we just patch the merged content accordingly?

just spitballin', of course. may help if we merge them into monotonicity under their respective sections, as it may help younger/newer mathematicians see what lies down the road (sorta?).

''' Background '''

[[WP:BLUELOCK|Extended confirmed protection]] (also known as "30/500 protection") is a new level of article protection that only allows edits from accounts at least 30 days old and with 500 edits. The automatically assigned [[WP:EXTENDEDCONFIRMED|"extended confirmed" user right]] was created for this purpose. The protection level was created following [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 129#New usergroup with autopromotion to implement arbitration "30-500" bans as a page protection|this community discussion]] with the primary intention of enforcing various arbitration remedies that prohibit editors under the "30 days/500 edits" threshold to edit certain topic areas. The [[WP:ARBCOM|Arbitration Committee]] recently [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee/Noticeboard/Archive 11#Arbitration motions regarding extended confirmed protection|passed a motion]] that established expectations for use of the protection within the scope of arbitration enforcement.

The protection policy currently states that extended confirmed protection may only be applied {{tq|in topic areas authorized by the Arbitration Committee or as a result of community consensus}} (per [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 129#New usergroup with autopromotion to implement arbitration "30-500" bans as a page protection|this discussion]]). However, it also states that {{tq|Criteria for community use have not been established.}} This request for comment seeks to establish such a community process for the use of extended confirmed protection. A [[Wikipedia:Village pump (idea lab)/Archive 20#Extended confirmed protection policy|discussion at the village pump ideas lab]] produced the following options.

''' Options '''

*'''Option A:''' Allow use only for topics authorized by the Arbitration Committee (current policy).
*'''Option B:''' Allow use only for topics authorized by the Arbitration Committee ''or'' for '''persistent sockpuppetry''' where semi-protection has proven to be ineffective (similar to what ArbCom [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee/Noticeboard/Archive 11#Arbitration motions regarding extended confirmed protection|stipulated]] for [[WP:AE|arbitration enforcement]] and [[WP:AC/DS|discretionary sanctions]] 30/500 applications). Notification is to be posted in a subsection of [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard|AN]] for review, unless the topic is already authorized for 30/500 protection by the Arbitration Committee.
*'''Option C:''' Allow use to combat any form of disruption (such as vandalism, edit wars, etc.) on any topic, given that semi-protection has proven to be ineffective. Notification is to be posted in a subsection of [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard|AN]] for review, unless the topic is already authorized for 30/500 protection by the Arbitration Committee.

Regarding the '''duration of the protection''', extended confirmed protection does not differ from semi or other forms of protection in that the duration is [[Wikipedia:Protection_policy#Guidance_for_administrators|proportional to the disruption observed]]. The one exception is topics authorized by the Arbitration Committee, which are often protected indefinitely.

For clarity, please support only one option. Supporters of option C may inherently support option B unless stated otherwise. <span style="color: #9932CC">[[:User:KrakatoaKatie|Katie]]<sup>[[User talk:KrakatoaKatie|talk]]</sup></span> 00:31, 4 July 2016 (UTC)}}

I am not happy with the RfC as proposed above, because it is the typical "let's dumb down the standard" phrasing that does not solve the problem of [[systemic bias]].  I'm rephrasing the problem: Two recent AfDs jump out at me as illustrative of Systemic Bias based on gender, race and national origin; far, far more  articles are proposed for deletion, and most of the arguments advanced are based upon a list of outcomes.   Where we have AfDs on minor pornstars being routinely kept because they "won an industry award", while women with doctorates and academic careers are routinely deleted as "not notable," we have a serious problem with the interpretation of WP:N.  
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alanna Shaikh]]
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kanwal Ameen]]
So this is my proposal:
*'''Shall WP:N include a section on how to assess issues of possible [[systemic bias]] in notability discussions?'''  
*Clearly, the devil is in the details, and this is '''not''' about "relaxing the standards," but rather it is about refining them so they do not exacerbate the problem of the legitimate systemic bias concern, which is sometimes expressed in articles about women being deemed "non-notable", particularly when the standards set for men often reflect their increased ability to gain promotion and recognition more than actual accomplishment or ability.

*[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography]]

I am requesting help concerning the above talk section comments "Preventing article bias" (subsection So-called) that is a somewhat one-sided discussion concerning the use of the wording "so-called". This is used on several articles and I have even found one reference that does use such wording. My questioning would be:

Is there fair justification for using this wording in instances that would result in the "Nazi-puppet state, ''so-called'' Independent State of Croatia (NDH)", in this article as well as the others? [[User:Otr500|Otr500]] ([[User talk:Otr500|talk]]) 15:55, 4 July 2016 (UTC)}}

Should the following content be included in this article:

{{bquote|In late June 2016, it was reported that Bill Clinton met privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on her private plane on the tarmac at [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]].  Officials indicated that the 30 minute meeting took place when Clinton became aware that Lynch's plane was on the same tarmac at the airport.  When the meeting became public, Lynch stated that it was "primarily social" and  "there was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body".  Lynch was criticized for her involvement in the meeting and was called on by some critics to recuse herself from involvement in the FBI's investigation of the email case.  In response, she stated "The F.B.I. is investigating whether Mrs. Clinton, her aides or anyone else broke the law by setting up a private email server for her to use as secretary of state," but "the case will be resolved by the same team that has been working on it from the beginning" and "I will be accepting their recommendations."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/us/politics/loretta-lynch-hillary-clinton-email-server.html|title=Lynch to Accept F.B.I.

{{rfcquote|text=
As per all valid proofs, Kannada was, is and shall always be the native language of Hindupur. Native languages can't be changed by any amount of migration whatsoever just like native Americans are the natives of America and not English/Europeans and its speakers the natives of US. However during the linguistic reorganisation of states in India in the 1950s, Hindupur was retained on the wrong side of the border in Andhra Pradesh whose official language is Telugu and the official policy encouraged migration of Telugu speakers. Currently, Telugu may be widely spoken there, however, Kannada speakers still constitute about 50% of its population and all of them speak Telugu the official language with others outside. A famous Kannada scholar from Hindupur was Kallur Subba Rao. Kannada was the dominant language in Hindupur in the 19th and even in the early 20th century which started to change only in the latter half of 20th century. Native language, dominant or widely spoken language and official language are 3 different concepts. Hence, the demographics section of Hindupur will contain Telugu as the official and widely spoken language and Kannada as the native language of Hindupur as also its surroundings.
Thanks and Regards!

This RfC is to gauge community consensus about the preferred URL format for [[archive.is]] and [[WebCite]] when used in citations.

Both sites permit two URL formats, a shortened version and a longer version. Examples:

:;archive.is
:*<code>http://archive.is/YYYYMMDDhhmmss/http://www.example.com</code>
:*<code>http://archive.us/Gt56j</code>
:;WebCite
:*<code>http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.example.com&date=YYYYMMDD</code>
:*<code>http://www.webcitation.org/5eWaHRbn4</code>
:*<code> http://www.webcitation.org/5eWaHRbn4?url=http://www.example.com/</code>(used in dewiki, the ID contains a base 62 coded timestamp extracted by the template [[:de:template:Webarchiv]])

::(pretend they go to the same link)

Which one is preferred, or are either equally appropriate? 

Related information:

*The document [[Wikipedia:Using_WebCite|Using WebCite]] says "Either is appropriate for use within Wikipedia," while the document [[Wikipedia:Using_archive.is|Using archive.is]] says "The [longer] is preferred for use within Wikipedia because it preserves the source URI."
*During the archive.is RfC, some users brought up concerns short URLs can hide spam links, noting URL-shortening services such as [[bit.ly]] have been blacklisted from Wikipedia.
*A user at the German Wikipedia said they mandate long form because if the archive service went out of business, they would still know what the original URL was.
*Reverse engineering a shortened link to find the original URI can be done using the WebCite API, or web scraping in archive.is case.  
*WebCite and archive.is default to the shortened version when creating a new link or in page display.

Please leave a !vote below, such as '''short''' or '''long''' or '''either'''. -- [[User:Green Cardamom|<font color="#006A4E">'''Green'''</font>]][[User_talk:Green Cardamom|<font color="#009933">'''C'''</font>]] 21:50, 5 July 2016 (UTC)}}

'''Proposed:''' All articles created on or after October 1, 2016 must specifically cite at least one independent (non-affiliated) [[WP:RS|reliable source]] in support of at least one claim or assertion of fact within the article. Articles created after this date that do not cite any reliable sources may be proposed for deletion using the same procedure employed for [[WP:BLPPROD]]. For the purposes of discussion we may refer to the as yet to be created tag and guideline as [[VPROD]]. Any editor including the article creator, may remove the VPROD tag as soon as a single independent reliable source is added to the article. Reviewing editors and in particular New Page Patrolers are strongly encouraged to look for a reliable source before adding the VPROD tag, especially in cases where commonsense would suggest the likely notability of the subject. Ultimately however, it is the responsibility of the creator of the article and any editors adding material to ensure that all claims are properly referenced to reliable sources. Articles created prior to October 1, 2016 are not subject to VPROD, although they remain subject to the provisions of [[WP:V]] and may be nominated for deletion via [[WP:AfD]] if it is believed that they fail to meet minimal standards for sourcing.

'''OP's Statement''' There are simply too many unsourced articles out there and more are getting through all the time. WP:V is mocked by the existence of unsourced articles, and the credibility of the project is undermined. There aren't enough editors working on NPP as evidenced by the perpetual backlog. And while one would hope that they will try to fix deficiencies in articles they are reviewing, especially serious ones, the reality is that again there aren't enough of them to get every new article up to snuff without the entire system of review grinding to a halt. Yes, I know that one can always later send a problematic article to AfD but that is not a practical solution. AfD is already barely functional from a lack of participation. Articles sent there routinely languish for weeks without a !vote. We need to streamline the process and shore up WP:V. There is no reason why the same standard, which is shockingly minimal, that is applied to BLPs should not be applied to all articles. If requiring editors creating an article to cite just one source is too onerous then it is time to stop calling this an encyclopedia. In closing, I wish to say that I know this will be controversial. All I ask is that the discussion stay calm and polite. (And a support !vote would be nice too.) -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 00:53, 24 July 2016 (UTC)}}

We definitely do not need a bunch of [[WP:REDUNDANTFORK]]s on every possible spelling of this name (or any name), especially when most of it's just disambiguation "un-content" instead of real content, spelling varies widely even for the same historical subjects, there are many more such variants, and none of them are likely possible to develop into a real and properly sourced article on the name without combining them. <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 22:32, 10 July 2016 (UTC)}}

hi guys,

so i saw the wiki for [[pre-measure]] and it says the reason it's not a measure is because it's not defined on a [[sigma-algebra]].
: that part is cool.

however, it seems to me that the content is ''more'' of a "precursor" to a measure than a pre-measure.
: it seems content needn't be defined over a sigma algebra (hence a [[measure]] being a [[sigma-additive]] content), so wouldn't the content be more of a [[pre-measure]] since it's not in terms of [[ring theory]], but sets?

in the case where the content is not defined over a sigma algebra, surely there is some sort of way we could tie it in with [[pre-measure]]?
: i understand the latter is speaking in terms of rings, but so is [[Carathéodory's extension theorem]], which is a measure-theoretic concept that could bridge these ideas together?

both content and pre-measure are sigma additive, too. surely i'm not off my rocker (I HOPE?! ;)) ? ty in advance for the chat guys. [[Special:Contributions/174.3.155.181|174.3.155.181]] ([[User talk:174.3.155.181|talk]]) 20:34, 7 July 2016 (UTC)}}

As can be seen in the section "'Explicit consensus' is bogus", above (section 75 until something gets archived), this page is now being dominated by arguments over what the consensus of this talk page currently is (and was, previously). It would be helpful if some editors not previously involved in this debate could read through the talk page could read through it and offer an opinion on (1) current apparent state of consensus on this talk page (2) state of consensus of the talk page at the time of the edits [[User:Toto11zi|Toto11zi]] keeps complaining about (which I created sections 32 and 33 for the express purpose of discussing).

I started a full rewrite of the article. I cannot say I am really satisfied with the current result, and I would like to apologize for that - I thought I could get it done without using the sandbox, but I saw too big. Do share any opposition to the general philosophy of how the contents are dealt with though, even if the article will badly need a copyedit (but the former version was worse in that respect).

This article, [[Bombardier Movia & CNR Changchun C951]], attracted attention in light of the [[Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries_%26_CSR_Qingdao_Sifang_C151A#List_of_alleged_flaws_on_C151A|C151A scandal]] that broke a few days ago. As a result, there is now a requested move and removal of the phrase "Changchun" trying to remove all references to China. Personally I never liked the MRT rolling stock articles to be named this way as convention in WikiProject Trains follow the operator rather than the manufacturer, but it is a fact established by several sources that these trains are constructed by Changchun Bombardier Railway Vehicles, a joint venture by Bombardier Transportation and CNR Changchun.

This is a continuation of this thread at AN: [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Proper CSD tag for &#123;&#123;OTRS received&#125;&#125; but not confirmed.|Proper CSD tag for &#123;&#123;OTRS received&#125;&#125; but not confirmed.]]
Some background for those that don't want to wade through the AN thread. I have been going through the old images at [[:Category:Wikipedia files with unconfirmed permission received by OTRS]], double checking the permissions ticket, and if the ticket has not been resolved I have been marking them for deletion. The current CSD criteria only mentions OTRS once and that is in [[WP:F11]]. However, this mention uses {{tl|OTRS pending}} not {{tl|OTRS received}}. The two are different. Pending is when the ticket has been said to have been sent but has not been reviewed by an agent. Received means the ticket ''was'' reviewed but did not contain enough information to {{tl|OTRS permission}} the image.
Images that I have been marking for deletion have been sitting, waiting for a response, for well over a month. This is the cutoff that Commons uses (see [[c:template:OTRS received]]) and that is plenty of time to work out the permissions once responded to by an agent.
So the question here is, what criteria should these images be marked under for deletion? Since the policy of CSD is rather strict, this needs to be worked out in order to make the processing of these images easier for everyone. Two main options here. F9 or F11. F11 has the further caveat that normally it has a 7 day delay with it. So if F11, with or without the extra week notice? <u>If you support F11 please indicate whether it should have an additional 7 day waiting period or not as well.</u> The other option would be to just use {{tl|db}} with a custom rationale and do away with the letter + number scheme for these images. --[[User:Majora|Majora]] ([[User talk:Majora|talk]]) 18:08, 7 August 2016 (UTC)}}

hi guys,

given that the generation of the regular borel measure is among the central objects of study in [[measure (mathematics)|measure theory]], and the fact that one can start with a primitive notion ([[set theory]]) to build a content, which then can generate such a measure, i was hoping we could start some discussion on tidying up some pages.
: i dislike definitions of measures that start without a primitive notion, as it defeats the purpose of the simplicity that measure theory is supposed to exploit.
:: this specific page (borel regular measure) is so brief i suspect there won't be much argument if we can merge it into [[content (measure theory)]]. however, i thought it was a useful example of a page that's not really helpful (no details on construction etc).

having read Halmos' (beautiful) construction of a borel measure from a content, which is then used to build the theory of [[Baire measure|Baire measures]] and [[linear functionals]], i feel that we need to have a discussion on how we can combine a bunch of these pages.
:i do not think the likes of [[Constantin Carathéodory]] thought there would be more than one way to define a measure (aside from things like a [[Gaussian measure]], which is the analytic form resulting from measuring "true nature"). 
:: [[Carathéodory's extension theorem]] is a very intimidating proof, but its beauty lies in the fact it can extend the appropriate definition (such as the one given by Halmos) into a Lebesgue measure. 
::: concepts relevant to this proof, such as set cover, enable us to exploit the [[Hasse principle]] (global-local principle) to procure such a measure 
:::: think of a unit sphere centred at each point in space; the natural overlap between adjacent points' spheres ("connected") provides fertile ground to apply Caratheodory's extension theorem. not saying it's published, but it has been done and known for quite some time.

being someone who considers himself a (seasoned, mind you) novice in this intimidating area of [[mathematical analysis]], some of these definitions seem superfluous (inner regular, outer regular, etc). 
:i accept that there are few resources to help fix these issues, but i thought i'd throw out my own view of some of these pages.

i am not trying to disparage contributions from mathematicians like [[Johann Radon]] and the likes, who have all tried to further develop this challenging line of thinking initiated by [[Henri Lebesgue]], [[Hermann Minkowski]] and his student [[Constantin Carathéodory]]; rather, i am just trying to point out the fact that measure theory was *always* focused on *measuring* in the real world. 
:i plan to start reading Caratheodory's exposition that propounds a measure-theoretic approach to thermodynamics after i click "save page", but i suspect this work will directly support my previous sentence (although he is just one person, he is Constantin Caratheodory...).
::i have belaboured the point that any numerical analysis purporting to use measure theory must demonstrate their construction starting from a primitive notion (sets), which are the foundation that later results are built on (see halmos).

you guys may disagree and shut down my line of thinking, which is fine, but i thought i'd throw it out there as i've noticed a lot of fragmentation. thanks [[Special:Contributions/174.3.155.181|174.3.155.181]] ([[User talk:174.3.155.181|talk]]) 22:02, 10 July 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The purpose of this section is to request opinions about this question:

'''Should the article make assertions about what is "currently" true with regard to record closing highs and/or intraday highs?'''  ("currently" meaning whenever a reader happens to read it).

Background info:  The article was edited (by an IP editor) on 15 July 2016 to add such an assertion.  This led to a series of edits and Talk page commentary, including the above comment from OwenX, "If you're going to edit that section, update it to the current numbers".

My opinion on the aforementioned question is "'''no'''", and I invite other opinions and reasons.  My reasons are as follows:
* Upon cursory review of past versions of the article, it appears that prior to 15 July 2016 there was no precedent that the "Price history" section made assertions that any past record highs noted in the article are still current in the present moment (that is, the moment when a reader reads the article).  In the absence of strong arguments to change, my inclination is to follow past precedent.
* Making statements about the "current" record high would place a burden on the editors to update that information whenever the record high changes.  In the absence of any editors who are established as being committed to the task of keeping it updated, we have a situation where readers will see the article frequently containing a false statement (that something is a "current" record high when it is not).
* While I am aware that many articles make assertions about what is true currently ("The current President of the United States is...", "The current capital of Japan is..."), those are things that don't change very often, and in those cases, assertions about what is current will likely be inaccurate for only minutes (or hours) over a period of many years, and very infrequently.  Stock indexes, on the other hand, might reach new record closing highs on a daily basis during steady bull markets, and reach new intraday highs minute-by-minute, meaning that assertions about "current" stock index record highs have a far higher likelihood and frequency of becoming out of date as the facts change, compared with those other kinds of events.
If there winds up being a consensus that the article should, in fact, make this kind of assertion, then my further suggestion would be to put it in a separate section or subsection called something like "Current record highs".  This would make it easier for readers to understand where to find accurate current information (as opposed to historical information, which is what "Price history" seems to imply), and also alert editors to the need for timely and vigilant attention to that section.

Again, my opinion on the above question is "no", for the above-mentioned reasons, and I invite other opinions and reasons.  Thanks.  -- [[User:HLachman|HLachman]] ([[User talk:HLachman|talk]]) 05:47, 28 July 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I have a question which I'd like to raise for discussion, about a potential conflict between [[WP:NMEDIA]] and actual practice. 

Officially, NMEDIA confers notability on a radio station only if it meets ''both'' of two conditions: possessing a broadcast license and having an established broadcast history (i.e. actually operating). In practice, however, WPRS has frequently looked the other way on the second condition, allowing an article about a proposed but not yet launched radio station to stand as soon as its license approval or "construction permit" is granted.

There's an example of the limitations of this approach unfolding in [[Montreal]] right now, where a company called TTP Media was granted three licenses in 2013 for stations on [[600 AM Montreal|AM 600]], [[850 AM Montreal|AM 850]] and [[940 AM Montreal|AM 940]] — as of June 19, however, the 850 license has expired unbuilt, and while 600 and 940 are technically still active licenses, they're also both still unbuilt as of today and will expire in November if they haven't been launched by then. Furthermore, apparently Montreal's established news media have been able to find ''no'' discernible indication of TTP engaging in the amount of corporate activity that would have to be happening right now in order to ''get'' two radio stations launched by November. So, while acknowledging that [[WP:CRYSTAL]] prevents me from stating anything ''definitive'' yet, the balance of ''probabilities'' at this point is that ''none'' of the three stations is actually going to launch. Accordingly, I've already had to nominate 850 for deletion, and while for the moment I'm waiting for it to become official in the case of 600 and 940, they're ''likely'' to have to be deleted in the fall as well.

This, then, is my question: should WPRS continue to permit articles about stations that have been licensed but not yet launched, and then target the ones that expire unbuilt for deletion only after they expire, or should we take NMEDIA more seriously by cracking down on articles about unlaunched stations, and switch to restricting them to draftspace until such time as they ''actually'' launch?

The article on Hamilton states that she coined the term "software engineering" and it now cites three webpages.  I noted on the talk page that authoritative paper encyclopedias disagree with that.  Twice I put the "dubious" tag on it, but they were removed by the same person, without adequate discussion or consideration.

According to ''Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology'', entry on software engineering, Edwin Reilly states that the term was coined at the NATO conference in Brussels in 1968.  He says that participant and historian Brian Randall believes that the term came from Fredrich L. "Fritz" Bauer. 

The ''Encyclopedia of Computer Science'', by Anthony Ralston and Edwin Reiley, third edition, says that the term first appeared at NATO conferences in 1968 and 1969, but in Germany and Italy.  They cite Naur, Randall, and Buxton, editors of "Software engineering: Concepts and Techniques", ''Proceedings of the NATO Conferences'', 1976. 
 
Whether or not Hamilton coined the term "software engineering" needs to be addressed.  [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] <sup>[[User talk:Bubba73|You talkin' to me?]]</sup> 18:34, 15 July 2016 (UTC)}}

As Anderson Lawler was Gary Cooper's closest friend in the early 30s, and a significant person in his life, it is proposed to include the following two sentences in the article: '"In 1929 Cooper met the aspiring Paramount actor Anderson Lawler, with whom he lived with for a year. Popular and unabashedly homosexual, Lawler introduced Cooper to Hollywood society, but their close friendship caused intense jealousy with Clara Bow and Lupe Velez."' Citation would be: Mann, William J. Behind the screen: how gays and lesbians shaped Hollywood, 1910-1969, Viking, 2001, pp105-11 Note: Lawler's homosexuality is referred to because (a) it was widely noted in Hollywood at the time and (b) the friendship with Cooper was frowned upon by some contemporaries for that fact (see citation for both points), but this RfC is only for discussing the proposed inclusion.

I am asking for comment regarding recent edits made by [[Special:Contributions/Gonzales John|Gonzales John]] ([[User talk:Gonzales John|talk]]). My main concern is that the edits appear to violate the neutrality of the article. The use of phrases such as "Christ myth theories are, in the modern age, not taken seriously by virtually all competent scholars" and "a person who believes the Christ myth theory is generally taken lowly by experts", coupled with the elimination of more than 20,000 bytes of referenced material as "excess info" and "undue weight" (quoting directly from edit summaries) and earlier revisions describing this as a "conspiracy theory" lead me to believe that this editor has a non-neutral agenda they wish to impose. 

I have asked Gonzales John to please refrain from making such edits and instead bring their concerns to this Talk page.

I'm raising an RfC question about the appropriateness of including information about a subject's stalker in a biography, in all cases. I see two issues:

* Second, are we inflicting low-value trivia on the reader, if there is no unusual or noteworthy content to relate, beyond the basic existence of a stalker?
The alternative POV is that including stalker info is generally appropriate, based on precedent and custom.

{{rfcquote|text=
After the end of foreign combat operations in Iraq, there were numerous discussions on this talk page as to whether the article should reflect the "conclusion" of the "Iraq War" or whether it should treat the conflict as "ongoing" past that point. The prevailing viewpoint was that, according to reliable sources, the terminology "Iraq War" referred to the 2003-2011 multinational, US-led military conflict within Iraq. In other words, while various conflicts continue to this day, "the Iraq War" had ended.

Recently, a handful of editors reached a questionable local "consensus" to fundamentally change the subject of the article; ''Iraq War'' would now be an umbrella article for ''all'' conflict in Iraq since the 2003 invasion. I've done some research and have come to the conclusion that the reliable sources ''still'' do not reflect the notion that the "Iraq War" is ongoing, and thus the article should not do so. Sources discussing the ''ongoing'' conflict no longer use the terminology "Iraq War", and sources that ''do'' use the term are specifically referring to the concluded multinational conflict of 2003-2011. I can't find anything that indicates that "Iraq War" should refer to ''all'' conflict since 2003, nor do I think the input in the last discussion was ''remotely'' enough to change the fundamental subject of a prominent and controversial article. It should require a stronger consensus, with more input, and [[WP:RS|hard evidence]], to make such a drastic change.

We should change it back to the previous stance, based on the fact that it was supported by reliable sources, or we should have a stronger consensus to the contrary.

===Statement of the problem'''

OK. This is complicated so bear with me (or just skip straight to the Proposal section). Let's fix this long-term bleeding wound. The documentation for this template says
:''{{xt|This template is meant for pull quotes, the visually distinctive repetition of text that is already present on the same page.}}
But this is nonsense, and in fact nobody -- and I mean, literally, nobody -- uses this template for that reason. 

"Pull quotes" are a technique used by by magazines to spiff up the layout. You "pull" a interesting section of text from the body of the article and highlight it by repeating in a box or whatever with a bigger font so so forth.

But an encyclopedia has no use -- literally no use -- for pull quotes in this sense. We are not a magazine. ''Repeating'' text in this way will only confuse the reader, and that is why it is never done. By "never done", I mean that in my 10+ fully active years here I have never seen it done even once. And I challenge the reader to look at ''n'' instances if "what links here" for {{tl|Pull quote}}, and I expect you will find zero instances of {{tl|Pull quote}} being used for actual "pull quotes" for any value of ''n''. I know I have, expanding ''n'' until I was overcome with boredom. All instances -- ''all'' instances -- of {{tl|Pull quote}} are used for normal quotes, in the same way {{tl|Quote}} and {{tl|Quotebox}} are used.

And if, by chance, you should find one instance of {{tl|Pull quote}} being used for it's supposed use of actual pull quotes, I suggest you consider editing the article to remove this, since repeating material in this manner is only going to confuse the reader, probably. This is why the second sentence of the documentation is (properly) {{xt|"In most cases, this is not appropriate for use in encyclopedia articles."}} which someone shoehorned into the text describing ''how to use it in articles'', which makes quite a dog's breakfast of the documentation and BTW renders this useful and attractive template with essentially no earthly use.

(But look, I'm open minded: it's not ''impossible'' that some use for pull quotes could be found. I guess. I can't think of any, but I guess you never know. Anything's possible I suppose. If such an unlikely circumstance should arise someday, we could then either create a new template for this unique situation, or -- more likely -- just let the editor use one of the existing quote templates (cquote, rquote, quote, quotebox, or whatever else we have)).

OK? With me so far? There's no use for pull quotes in this encyclopedia, evidenced by the the fact that there are ''are'' no pull quotes, or practically none, and indeed the second sentence of the documentation says just that.

OK, so then why not just ''delete'' this template? Well, because ''it's attractive and useful''. I use it all the time and recommend that you do also. To my mind it's far superior to {{tl|quote}}, which highlights quotes just by indenting them, which (to my mind) is confusingly insufficient to separate them from the normal text (especially when there are lots of thumbnail pictures or other formatting geegaws, when you can substitute "insufficient" with "completely useless"). I don't like to use {{tl|quote}} because in a lot of instances it's just not at all clear that we are shifting from normal article text to a quotation, and it's confusing to the reader IMO.

But then there is {{tl|quotebox}}, which puts an ASCII-type box around the quote, which is fine -- if you are editing in 1986. I'm not. We used to put ASCII boxes around text in our [[MS-DOS]] programs and we thought we were the bee's knees. It was cool then. It's not now. If disco comes back we can talk about reviving {{tl|quotebox}}. Until then, it's horribly ugly and archaic looking.

But hey. I'm OK with people using {{tl|quote}} and {{tl|quotebox}} if they want. Let a thousand flowers bloom. For my part, I've been using {{tl|cquote}} and {{tl|rquote}} for quotes, with their at least ''somewhat'' sporty large quotation marks, for like ten years now, with no objections and no problems. So have lots of other editors, according to the "what links here here" results.

So I changed the documentation to reflect this (a while back) and an editor objected, so here we are with this RfC which should, to my mind, be open-and-shut. Even if you don't agree with ''me'', you ought to agree that rules should document actual practice, not what some editor thought ''should be'' actual practice ten years ago. 

In one sense it doesn't matter. People are (sensibly) not going to put pull quotes in article, and (sensibly) are going to use to {{tl|cquote}} and {{tl|rquote}} for normal quotes. In another sense, it would make sense to have the documentation reflect this use; probably some editors have been dissuaded from using this functional and useful template because of the incorrect documentation.

'''Proposal'''

*1) Move "Template:Pull quote" to "Template:Cquote", and move "Template:Reduced pull quote" to "Template:Rquote". (These pages already exist as redirects).
*2) Change the documentation for {{tl|Cquote}}. Remove this material from the beginning of the documentation:
::''{{xt|This template is meant for pull quotes, the visually distinctive repetition of text that is already present on the same page. In most cases, this is not appropriate for use in encyclopedia articles. The Manual of Style guidelines for block quotations recommend formatting block quotations using the {{tl|Quote}} template or the HTML <nowiki><blockquote></nowiki> element, for which that template provides a wrapper. Pull quotes work best when used with short sentences, and at the start or end of a section, as a hint of or to help emphasize the section's content. For typical pull quotes, especially those longer than the rest of the paragraph in which they are quoted, {{tl|Pull quote}} provides a borderless quote with decorative quotation marks, and {{tl|Quote frame}} provided ''[sic]'' a bordered quote. Both span the article width. For very short pull quotes, {{tl|Reduced pull quote}} (with decorative quotation marks) or {{tl|Quote box}} (framed) can be used to set the quote off to either the right or left as in a magazine sidebar. This can be effective on essay pages and WikiProject homepages. -- Usage -- For actual pull quotes, this template provides a centered, borderless pull quote, with scalable decorative quotation marks, and optional attribution of the source of the quote. It can be used with or without the names of the parameters.}}''
:and replace it with this:
::''{{xt|{{tl|Cquote}} adds a block quotation to an article page. It is similar to {{tl|Quote}}, but more decorative in that it adds a set of large (but scalable) quotation marks, at the beginning and end of the quoted text, around a centered, borderless quote, and optional attribution of the source of the quote. It can be used with or without the names of the parameters. In all other ways it is similar to {{tl|Quote}}, and may be used in place of {{tl|Quote}}, at the editor's discretion. See also {{tl|Rquote}} for when it is desired to include a short quote which does not span the width of the paragraph.}}''
*3) And make similar changes to {{tl|Rquote}} to match this.
*4) And make the following changes to [[MOS:BLOCKQUOTE]] (which is the "Block quotations" section of the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style]] (MOS)). Change this sentence
::''{{xt|Do not enclose block quotations in quotation marks (and especially avoid decorative quotation marks in normal use, such as those provided by the {{tl|pull quote}} a.k.a. {{tl|cquote}} template, which are reserved for pull quotes).}}''
:to
::''{{xt|{{tl|Cquote}} and {{tl|rquote}} are alternatives to {{tl|quote}} which enclose the block quotation in large quotation marks.}}''

Should reliably sourced content that demonstrates the "Healther Hoax" is based on manipulated photos and videos be kept or deleted? Specifically, the following passage which has been repeatedly blanked (cites removed for ease of reading but viewable here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conspiracy_theories_of_the_United_States_presidential_election,_2016&oldid=735952856]): 
{{cquote|Several videos and photographs were manipulated, or taken out of context, by conspiracy theorists to support claims of Clinton's alleged health issues, including: 
* A [[Getty Images]] photograph from February 2016 showing Clinton being helped by two men to ascend a flight of stairs. The rumor-examination website [[Snopes.com]] concluded that the August 2016 claim was a "mixture" of truth and falsehoods, noting that the photograph was "genuine" but "not recent," as it had been taken back in February. The Getty Images photograph also had a caption that stated that Clinton merely "slipped while [she] walked up stairs in South Carolina."
* A June 10, 2016, video posted to YouTube showing Clinton at a campaign stop in which it appears she turns her head back-and-forth vigorously for several seconds. In fact, the video was manipulated to loop a much shorter Clinton head turn to create the appearance of a [[spasm]].
* An early August incident where a Clinton speech was disrupted by protesters and in which a man approached Clinton, who had paused, and reassured her that the situation was under control. Though some conspiracy bloggers alleged the man to be a [[neurologist]], it was later confirmed he was in fact Secret Service Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Todd Madison.}} [[User:LavaBaron|LavaBaron]] ([[User talk:LavaBaron|talk]]) 07:14, 24 August 2016 (UTC)}}

'''1.''' Should (a) out-of-circulation currency and (b) stamps issued for mass circulation as currency, be admitted as notable and their non-free images used in visually topical articles such as [[Federal Reserve note]], [[United States five-dollar bill]] and [[Puerto Rico on stamps]] when accompanied with the applicable image templates?

:Support would be a step toward permitting the continued informal exemption allowed for national currency and extend it to allow for USPS stamps.

'''2.''' Should NFCC#8 be amended to read, "Contextual significance. Non-free content is used only if its presence would significantly increase readers' understanding of the article topic, and its omission would be detrimental to that understanding. ''Publisher descriptions of currency and stamps issued for mass circulation as currency is sufficient for contextual significance when used along with applicable image templates''.”?

:Support would provide a formal consistent exception for national currency and stamps issued for mass circulation as currency such as USPS stamps. 

* After some lengthy discussion at the Village Pump and [[Wikipedia talk:Non-free content/Archive 66#USPS image use]] over the criteria to allow non-free images of USPS stamps at [[Puerto Rico on stamps]], seven editors were unable to arrive at a consensus on the NFCC and NFCI requirements as currently written, or whether an amendment of NFCC#8 were required. The editors were [[User|TheVirginia Historian]], [[User|WhatamIdoing]], [[User|SMcCandlish]], and [[User|Hammersoft]] for exemption of currency and stamps issued for mass circulation as currency, [[User|Masem]], [[User|Seraphimblade]], and [[User|Diego]] in the minority against. 

'''Proponents''' noted that 11 of the top 25 articles with the most use of non-free images are currency articles. We already have two stamp articles on that same top 25 list. The USPS as a governmental agency may not be competent to copyright its stamps at all. Non-free use of USPS images should be allowed in visually topical articles when they are accompanied with the [[Template:Stamp rationale]] whenever a free use alternative to the stamp image does not exist of the USPS stamp itself. As it explains at [[WP:NFCI]]#3, currency and stamp images may be used for identification of the stamp or currency, not the subjects depicted on it. WP:NFC#UUI#9 justifies use of the stamp image if placed inline next to the commentary, because the stamp itself is the subject of sourced discussion in the article. Just using prose does not replace the visual information found in the image. The Foundation allows exceptions to its non-free use policy at [https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Licensing_policy Foundation licensing policy]. The informal exemption for currency is arbitrarily administered in the case of currency, and results in wholesale deletion of USPS images without discussion on stamp related pages. In the case of [[Puerto Rico on stamps]], it results in removal of over half the US stamps issued about Puerto Rican personalities, places, events in American culture. 

'''Opponents''' held that stamps are not the same as currency, currency can be informally permitted as non-free use images without formal exception because there are fewer notes. Out of circulation notes and coins may or may not be exempted in the future depending on administration of the NFCC by interested editors -- they are allowed without policy, they may be removed without policy. Contextual significance for stamps is found only by scholarly commentary of the art pictured on the stamps, not the stamps themselves, but currency is exempted. While mass circulated currency is informally exempted without policy justification, only images of stamps with printing errors achieve notoriety sufficient for inclusion at WP. These may be exempted, as well as stamps with out-of-copyright art pictured, and the USPS fine art series with USPS fine arts series descriptions of the stamp art. One or two USPS images can always be used in each stamp related article to suggest their existence since 1978. If exemptions are allowed for currency and stamps issued as currency, it will open the floodgates allowing every non-free use image everywhere throughout WP, violating the Foundation admonition to use few of them. 10:08, 28 July 2016 (UTC)}}

Alright so, the RfC above with withdrawn after it became [[WP:SNOW|pretty clear]] that the correct tag for these types of images is F11 as the default. Now the question is whether or not the additional 7 day waiting period should be applied for these types of images. Note, it does not matter that the ''current'' F11 version does not include a type of "immediate F11". This is a question on whether or not the F11 criterion should be amended. The current practice with these images is for the permission holder to send in the proper permissions to OTRS. If the email has been reviewed by an agent but deemed not sufficient the image is tagged with {{tl|OTRS received}}. After 30 days the ticket should be rereviewed by an agent and if no valid permissions has been received the image will be tagged F11.

== Speedy deletion criteria for books '''

I know that there has been talk about creating a speedy deletion criteria for books, but there's never really been any true consensus on this. I think I might have come up with something that could potentially be doable. My thought is that this would fall under [[WP:A9]] for the most part, as that one of the main things I drew from, but it could potentially be a new criteria on its own.

The basic gist of this criteria is that it would only apply to books that are published through vanity or self-publishing outlets like AuthorHouse, Smashwords, and CreateSpace, where the books do not make a credible assertion of notability ''and'' the author/contributor(s) do not have an article. This would allow us to quickly get rid of the obviously non-notable stuff like some random self-published book by a non-notable author without having to go through a full AfD. There are too many articles that have to go through a full AfD, despite being so obviously non-notable that there's not even a question that they'll be deleted. This criteria would also apply to fanfiction posted to places like FanFiction.net, so that we don't have to have to bring something like [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/FASTLANE(Zootopia)|this]] to AfD because fanfiction doesn't always cleanly fit into web content. I've included podcast novels in this since that's sort of akin to self-publishing, but I'm fine with that portion being removed since it's a bit of a grey area publication-wise.

The criteria would not cover any book that is published through a large, indie, academic, or small press. It would also not cover the deletion of any book where the author has an article, nor where any credible assertion of notability is made. This assertion would be considered to be things such as coverage in a RS (a [[WP:TRIVIAL|trivial]] mention would suffice as long as the source is a RS), assertion of bestselling status, the book being adapted into a film/TV show/game, or a major award - the typical type of stuff that admins consider when judging [[WP:A7|A7]] deletions. I am thinking about making the age of the book part of this criteria - if the book was published prior to 2000, it would not qualify under this criteria. People could self or vanity publish prior to this point of time, of course, but it was harder to do so and slightly more rare than it is nowadays. That would keep us from instantly deleting a book from say, the early 1900s or earlier, as there's the possibility that the book ''could'' be notable. I chose 2000 based on the date in the [[self-publishing]] article that stated that the 2000s were kind of a turning point as far as self-publishing goes. We could probably go later if anyone wanted, but I think that 2000 is a decent option that would cover the majority of self-published and vanity works without being too inclusive or exclusive.

Here's my mockup of the basic guideline, but feel free to suggest tweaks and alterations. 

:::''No indication of importance (books).''

:::''This criteria applies to any book that is either self-published or a vanity printing after 2000 and does not give any indication where the work is important or significant and where the author or contributors' article does not exist (all criteria must be true). Fanfiction and podcast novels would qualify under this criteria if there is no assertion of notability and the author does not have an article. This is distinct from questions of verifiability and reliability of sources, and is a lower standard than notability. The criterion does not apply to any article that makes any credible claim of significance or importance even if the claim is not supported by a reliable source or does not qualify on Wikipedia's notability guidelines. The criterion does apply if the claim of significance or importance given is not credible. If the claim's credibility is unclear, you can improve the article yourself, propose deletion, or list the article at articles for deletion.''

;;;'''With new changes suggested by Graeme and Kevin''' (Updated again)
:::''This criterion applies to any book that is published to the self-publishers or vanity publishers CreateSpace, AuthorHouse, Smashwords, Lulu, Leadstart Publishing, or the publisher is the same name as the author after the year 2000 and does not give any indication where the work is important or significant and where the author or contributors' article does not exist (all criterion must be true). Fanfiction and podcast novels would qualify under this criterion if there is no assertion of significance and the author does not have an article. This is distinct from questions of verifiability and reliability of sources, and is a lower standard than notability. The criterion does not apply to any article that makes any credible claim of significance or importance even if the claim is not supported by a reliable source or does not qualify on Wikipedia's notability guidelines. The criterion does apply if the claim of significance or importance given is not credible. If the claim's credibility is unclear, you can improve the article yourself, propose deletion, or list the article at articles for deletion.''

My basic thought is that this is kind of overdue, given that anyone and their mother can put out a work through a vanity or self publisher nowadays. Again, this wouldn't cover anything put out through regular publishing arms or anything with even a remotely viable claim of assertion. 

I'm going to ping the following editors, who were active during the bestseller as notability conversation at [[WP:NBOOK]], are still reasonably active, and are editors that I'm fairly familiar with. {{ping|AngusWOOF|DGG|Coolabahapple|James500|Piotrus|Dream Focus}} I figure that you all run the gamut on how you approach articles, so we'd get a nice variety of input from all of you.

The parameter 'trustees' does not exist in the template code, however it has been documented. This leads to the questions:

1) should the parameter be added to the code, or removed from the documentation? 

2) if the parameter is be be added, should the trustees be listed under 'key people', or have a separate entry in the infobox under trustee/s?

3) Technical question - how can it be determined if any articles using the infobox have used the parameter trustess?

There was a rather poorly devised name change for this article a while ago from Dersim rebellion to Dersim massacre. This has caused some problems that were later moved to ANI, where I suggested an RFC to decide the title. None of the disputing editors took it up on it, and the AN/I thread was archived as usual. So I decided to start one myself upon the suggestion from {{u|Tiptoethrutheminefield}}.

As discussed above, I think we categorize languages in a number of ways. I propose both categories for when the language is first attested and when it is extinct. If there's issues on the titling, that can be discussed later. I also propose that the same language articles be put into the general establishments/disestablishment categories based on locations. Please either support/oppose the ''concept'' of these categories and renaming can be done later. For example, [[Meroitic language]] is in [[:Category:Languages attested from the 3rd century BC]], [[:Category:3rd-century BC establishments in Africa]], [[:Category:Languages extinct in the 4th century]]
and [[:Category:4th-century disestablishments in Africa]]. As noted above, the introductions category can be used as is done for [[Esperanto]]. I put separate discussion sections for each portion.  -- [[User:Ricky81682|Ricky81682]] ([[User talk:Ricky81682|talk]]) 03:17, 3 August 2016 (UTC)}}

Critical reception at the top is always important to make an article to stand out and most importantly, to make readers understand what the article tries to convey. Every article of music here on Wikipedia, at least good ones, tends to have a sum up at the top, talking about the writers, the song's genre, the commercial part and, of course, the critical reception. This part tends to have what the majority of the critics thought about the song, if the song received favorable/positive/negative/mixed reviews, highlighting what some critics thought about the song (if it's a highlight, if it's a filler, etc.) and some adjectives or specific details about it ("catchy", "great hook", etc.) as a simple sum up. In this article (and in some others - that's why I'm adding this template in others that have the same issue), there's an issue, since I revamped the whole article, with reliable sources, and at the top, as usual, after reading again the critical reception, I take what is more important (if the song received favorable or mixed reviews and what some critics think about the song, as what any other good user does) and add it. However, everything about the critical reception at the top was taken and I know how work and effort I put into adding these statements, and I want to contribute more and more on Wikipedia, but every article that I tend to add a critical reception at the top (which is part of good articles here and there's more than 200 examples) is taken away even if what I add (if it's positive or not and some highlights that critics claimed about the song) is the usual, as any other user add. I want to make sure that is correct adding what critics think about the song at the top, and most important, my edits to be reverted and the critical reception part to be add again at the top of the articles, because it seems like every article that I revamp and put a simple sum up about the critical reception is taken away as a big issue, but it's not at all.

Seddique Mateen is the father of the mass murderer in the June 2016 massacre
at a gay club in Orlando.  He attended a rally for the Clinton campaign and
endorsed Clinton.  He has publicly commented that while he disapproves of the
murders, he is against homosexuality (or maybe not).  These facts were
reported by media outlets as something of interest to the campaign
(presumably, something that could influence voters to vote for or against
Clinton), but public commentary on the matter died out after a few days.

Should this incident be mentioned in the article?

I request that people not comment here on details of what the article should
say about the incident, but focus on the simpler threshold issue of whether it
is even worth mentioning, as there is already controversy over even that.  If consensus

'''Should a [[WP:NPAGEANT]] set of consensus guidelines be created, linked from [[WP:N]]?'''

'''Comments by nominator:'''  Per [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Women/Article alerts]], I am seeing large numbers of beauty pageant CONTESTANT articles nominated for deletion, mostly state-level pageant winners or national winners of obscure pageants. There are also navboxes for state pageant winners for Miss USA (and maybe Miss America) as well as navboxes for each year's contestants.  Someone is going to a lot of work, while others are going to a lot work at AfD. I also see there is no [[WP:NMODEL]] set of suggested notability guidelines (SNG) that discuss pageant winners.  Most discussions cite [[WP:NMODEL]] and the general notability guidelines at [[WP:GNG]].  A few AfD discussions point out that [[WP:BIO1E]] may also be applicable. So my suggestion is to save someone a lot of time and effort and create a formal set of guidelines, linked from [[WP:N]], and to include the specific question:  Does winning a state-level pageant that is a qualifier for Miss USA or Miss America automatically or inherently confer notability? This page could also discuss what confers notability of an individual pageant as well.

{{rfcquote|text=
I'd like to propose some common sense guidelines for [[Wikipedia:Stand-alone lists#Citing sources|#Citing sources]] and/or [[MOS:MUSIC]]. There are virtually no guidelines for music genres, and because of that, I often find myself in edit wars making these same arguments over and over again, so I would like official consensus on these matters:
* WP:GENREVERIFY (clarification of [[WP:VERIFY]])
**'''Music genres are almost always [[WP:MINREF|likely to be challenged]]'''. Exceptions may be made for high-level root genres like rock, pop, electronic, folk, etc.
** Thus, '''all entries must be verifiable''' for exemplar subgenre articles like [[List of psychedelic pop artists]], [[List of blues rock musicians]], and [[List of trip hop artists]].
** "The source is in their respective articles" is not a valid rationale ([[WP:CIRCULAR]]). If it is the case, then simply copy over the relevant source(s) to establish verifiability and notability.
* WP:EXPLICITGENRE (clarification of [[WP:STICKTOSOURCE]] and [[WP:SYNTH]])
**References must be explicit in saying that the artist belongs to a genre. For instance, a source that identifies the Beatles' ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' as "a folk rock album" does not mean that the Beatles count as a folk rock band.
** Sources must ''directly support'' cited genres. When a source writes that a work "mixes experimental, rock, and jazz", it does not necessarily follow that it is a work ''of'' experimental, rock, and jazz. By the same token, if a source cites a work of pop music for using synthesizers prominently, this should not lead an editor to refer to the work as "synthpop" if not explicitly stated by the source.

I don't want a Wikia or Wikimedia alternative because I don't see anything I would be interested in editing. Uncyclopedia, RationalWiki and Encyclopedia Dramatica are too strange/weird. I'd like to find a good Wikipedia knockoff that still has strict but easily understood NPOV and verification policies that have the same rules as on Wikipedia but is interpreted the same way throughout the Wiki because it reads in an easy-to-understand way so there are no conflicts over how to properly interpret the policies and reasoning can come pretty fast but despite having similar policies to Wikipedia; won't have any way to block or ban users if they make too many stupid edits or write too much or even for harassing editors and calling them names like "disruptive" and "incompetent" too much but there are no ads so no lag or accidentally clicking one or stumbling on a bad one. I think that would be a good one because stupid people would be politely dealt with instead of being kicked from the site but still has similar copyright policy and other kinds of policy like Wikipedia, but there is no 'competence is required' policy so stupid people don't get discriminated against. #DumbLivesMatter #NoobLivesMatter #AllLivesMatter --[[User:Turkeybutt JC|Turkeybutt]] ([[User talk:Turkeybutt JC#top|talk]]) 12:58, 10 September 2016 (UTC)}}

'''In brief: How should we treat links to anthroponymy pages?'''

For those unfamiliar, [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Anthroponymy]] pages are a somewhat unique beast: they list people who share a given name or surname <s>or complete name</s>, and they are often treated like disambiguation pages, though they are categorized as set index articles. <small>(Aside: there is no MOS guideline for these pages, just the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Anthroponymy/Standards|WikiProject standards]] page. I have tried unsuccessfully to have this page promoted to the MOS; the absence of a MOS for anthro pages is a big problem to be tackled separately.)</small>

'''The issue at hand:''' There is no consensus on how to treat links to anthro pages. For ''dab'' pages, the correct method is to link to "Title (disambiguation)", which may be a redirect to the actual dab page—this is to make it clear to bots that the link is intentional, so it doesn't show up on lists of ambiguous links that need to be fixed (see [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links]]). IMO, the same logic applies to anthroponymy pages, and this has clearly been the practice for quite some time (see tens of thousands of examples in [[:Category:Redirects to disambiguation pages]]). However, this practice is in dispute (see [[User talk:Bkonrad#Alphonse]]), on the basis that anthro pages should not be considered dab pages, even for this purpose. I've tried to create a workaround with {{tl|R to anthroponymy page}}, in parallel with {{tl|R to disambiguation page}}, but I think a question affecting such a huge number of pages needs larger input. The options I see are (add any you think I missed):

For linking to anthroponymy pages:
# Point all links directly to the anthroponymy page (This leaves no simple way to sort intentional links from unintentional ones that should be further disambiguated.)
# Leave or create "Name (disambiguation)" redirects, using {{tl|R to disambiguation page}} (This has the drawback that anthro pages may not ''strictly'' be dab pages, though they do list ambiguous entries.)
# Create "Name (anthroponymy)" redirects, using {{tl|R to anthroponymy page}} (This would require the most work (probably by bot), but would, IMO, leave things in the most useful state.)

Thoughts? If you have a preference for one of the listed options, please indicate so. —[[user:swpb|<u>swpb</u>]]<sup>[[user talk:swpb|''T'']]</sup> 15:52, 24 August 2016 (UTC)}}

Should Eron Gjoni's side of the story be reported?

I tried to add Eron Gjoni's side of the story in edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gamergate_controversy&diff=734887712&oldid=734032358 734887712], but it was quickly reverted by frequents editors of this article citing "need for concensus," which seems to be abuse of the concept of concensus. Concensus is noted to be needed for bold edits. I'm adding Gjoni's side of the story in a tiny manner. There is no controversy in that. Not noting his side of the story would infringe upon [[WP:BLP]]. [[User:Mr. Magoo and McBarker|Mr. Magoo]] ([[User talk:Mr. Magoo and McBarker|talk]]) 11:22, 17 August 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I firmly believe that the lede of the "Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory" section is a case of [[WP:SYNTHESIS]]. [[User:Jobrot]] disagrees and has repeatedly reverted my [[WP:NPOV]] warning without cause. The lede currently states:
{{blockquote|'Cultural Marxism' in modern political parlance commonly refers to a conspiracy theory which sees the Frankfurt School as part of a contemporary movement within the political left to take over and destroy Western society.}}

If we pare the statement down to its essentials, it states that:

{{blockquote|'Cultural Marxism' in modern political parlance commonly refers to a conspiracy theory}}

The claim being advanced is:

1. It is a conspiracy theory.

2. This "fact" is commonly known and the cultural and political mainstream (all major political and cultural  divisions) believes this without a shadow of a doubt.

3. Only a small fringe continues to use the term in a "non-ironic" way.

The sources cited as evidence are:

1. An article by Jerome Jamin, a left-wing academic researching right-wing movements.

2. An article by Bill Berkowitz for the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], a left-wing organization which maintains large lists of what it believes to be right-wing and religious movements and hate-groups. The article is entitled '''Reframing the Enemy'''.

3. American paleo-conservative [[William S. Lind]].

Now, it is no surprise that left-wingers like Jamin and Berkowitz/SPLC believe that "Cultural Marxism" is a conspiracy theory. But Lind does not believe that. Neither do the right-wingers mentioned by Berkowitz in his article.

The conclusion is that only some left-wingers consider "Cultural Marxism" to be a conspiracy theory. And instead of stating things as they are, the section currently uses [[WP:SYNTHESIS]] and weasel words like '''commonly refers to''' (without mention the subjects who do the referring) to convert an opinion held in some parts of the left to a strong, universal claim.

I formally request comments on the structure of the lede. [[User:Last Contrarian|Last Contrarian]] ([[User talk:Last Contrarian|talk]]) 12:44, 16 August 2016 (UTC)}}

RFC Question: '''Should we add a "source code repository" field to the infobox?'''

Caveats:
* It could go against [[WP:EL]] that says links that can be found as part of official website should not be included in the article.
* Doing so can make the infobox long and unwieldy. Sometimes, like in the case of [[Signal (software)]], there are four or five links. The External Links section is a better place.
* It is technical information that is no readily usable to every reader. Only programmers willing to participate in development need ready access to such links.

Consensus was in late 2013 to merge the articles [[Miniature American Shepherd]] and [[Miniature Australian Shepherd]] (see above). This stalled due to arguing about the name in 2014, followed by johnny-come-lately objections in 2015 on the basis that some people out there are still trying to produce a separate breed or subbreed under the "Australian" name. (Note that Australia itself is not implicated in any way; all three breeds or would-be breeds under discussion actually originated in the US).

I would like to propose a discussion on the information in the article, [[List of Mock the Week episodes]], in regards to Wins and Scores.  My belief is that the information should not be included there; in my personal opinion, I don't think it has anything to warrant notability at all, as the show is not a serious competition and most of the rounds don't focus on news articles on the week before its broadcast/filming, because they involve stand-up on certain topics and improve games.  My proposal is simply to comment on what to do with the information and draw some consensus on this (after I let personal feelings get the better of me).  The following options should be considered in this discussion:

* Should the information be deleted, and if so, why should it be the case in your own words?
* Should the information be merged into the main article here, and if so, why?  If it is merged into this article, should it be all the information or some of it?
* Should the information remain where it is?  If so, why?

I have recently encountered a confusion regarding these and A7. It was insisted that Churches are eligible for A7 as organisations. However, I look through the categories, and they are definitely classed under Buildings and Structures, and I haven't yet found any indication of them being classed under organisations (unless I missed something?). Even [[Church (building)|the article about Churches]] explicitly identify them as buildings. Hotels and hospitals appear to be classed under both; what does this mean exactly? Does it mean that both [[WP:ORG]] and [[WP:GEOFEAT]] apply? If so, how does that work? And are they eligible for A7 or not, or both (???). This is all rather confusing because, if I go to (for argument's sake) [[Wexham Park Hospital]], 2 of the 3 categories there are Hospital Buildings, and Buildings and Structures. No indication of it being classed as an organisation yet. Only after digging through the categories do I find that Hospitals are also under Medical and health organisations. Same with (again, for argument's sake) [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo]]; categories include Hotel buildings, and of course, Buildings and Structures. No explicit indication of it being an organisation. Again, only after trawling through the categories do I find that hotels also come under companies. At face value, hospitals and hotels (or at least the two examples given here) appear to be classed under Buildings and Structures only. Does this mean they are ''primarily'' Buildings, and ''secondarily'' organisations? My query is thus: are these (for the purposes of A7) buildings, or organisations, and are they/should they be A7-eligible? And if they're under organisations, perhaps a note explaining all of this should be put somewhere (the templates perhaps?), or maybe a new (sub)category for A7 should be implemented?

===Statement of the issues'''

There's no "Survey" section in this RfC and no up/down vote on an action item. That can come later. There's a lot to chew on here, so let's just have a threaded discussion(s). Maybe we can generate an action item(s) to "vote" on further down the road.

It's a complicated question covering a decade of use of some half-dozen templates which are transcluded over some half a million articles, with documentation in several places. So I apologize in advance for the length of the material.

'''The basic questions of this RfC'''

The basic question is '''"How should quotes be handled in articles"''' A legitimate answer, of course, is "exactly as they have been". (We are referring in this RfC to typical quotes from a general source, not specialized situations handled by specialized templates such as {{tl|Quote hadith}} etc.)

So some more detailed questions that arise from this might be:
*Is it OK to continue to have three different templates used for general quotes, or not? Why or why not?
*The [[WP:MOS]] specifies to use {{tl|Quote}} for quotes, and doesn't mention {{tl|Quote box}} one way or the other, but {{tl|Quote box}} itself says to not use it for regular quotes -- yet {{tl|Quote box}} is used for quotes far more often than {{tl|Quote}}; ought this situation be addressed, or not, and if so how?
*{{tl|Cquote}} is used a fair amount for quotations, even though this MOS strictly forbids this; ought this situation be addressed, or not, and if so how?
*This MOS by inference supports pull quotes ("the {{tl|pull quote}}... template, which [is] reserved for pull quotes"). Should this MOS discourage or even forbid pull quotes, or is it OK like this?

And there are probably lots of other questions. Possible solutions are many, including 
*Doing nothing, leave the present situation as is.
*Functionally deleting two of {{tl|Quote}} / {{tl|Quote box}} / {{tl|Cquote}} (by just making two of them a redirect to the remaining one? or whatever would be the best way technically to achieve this function).
*Changing the documentation to overtly permit use of all three (or: some two) templates for quotes at editors' discretion.
*Designing a new template which is better than any of the existing ones and deprecating the old ones.
*Writing a new protocol which carves out separate uses for {{tl|quote}} and {{tl|quote box}} and/or {{tl|cquote}}.

And certainly there are many other good ideas to be had. That's the purpose of this RfC, to think about these and various other possibilities, and maybe we can find some that seem worthy of being presented as action items, down the road.

Hello,

I am wondering if interested editors would like to establish a WikiProject on [[homelessness]].

# Enough time has passed since [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Proposals/Homelessness|this last proposal]].
# The topic is certainly valid and notable (it's a level 4 vital article in Society), relates to a variety of fields (social work, sociology, psychology, health).
# I have recently created [[Template:Homelessness]], linking at least 70 articles on general homelessness topics, e.g. by country, type, etc. And there are others linked on separate templates and lists (e.g. [[List of homelessness organizations]], [[List of street newspapers]]).

I'm not entirely familiar with the process of creating a project, I'm guessing we would need at least 5 other editors to join the project and help index and tag pages.

Recently, an anonymous IP started annotating the list of athletes in this article with running medal counts, marked by [[File:Gold medal icon (G initial).svg|G]], [[File:Silver medal icon (S initial).svg|S]] or [[File:Bronze medal icon (B initial).svg|B]] icons. And I don't just mean one icon per person, but an icon for ''every'' medal the person ever won — [[Ian Thorpe]], for example, had nine icons after his name. As I don't believe tallying medal counts is relevant in this context, but instead just clutters up the article unnecessarily, I removed it with an explanation in my edit summary — however, my removal has now been reverted twice (once by another anonymous IP, and once by a newly registered username who's probably that same IP), with no explanation given of why the information ''was'' warranted — the only "explanation" given was a false claim that my edits constituted ''vandalism''.

Rather than letting this turn into an ongoing revert war, however, I want to solicit opinions: is there a compelling reason that I'm missing why the list of LGBT athletes in this article ''should'' directly annotate their full medal counts, or was I right to remove that as not being useful or relevant content in this context?

Extensive debate over the past week regarding the selection of a consistent citation format for citations in the [[Jane Austen]] article. A group of three editors have stepped up to offer to do the complete conversion of the article into Harvard format following WP:CITEVAR ({{ping|Jonesey95|RexxS|Prairieplant}}) which has been substantially started by them already. They were rebuffed by users Victoriaearle and Lingzhi who felt that the original version of the article from 10 years ago had initially been started in MLA format by the late Wadewitz. Since Wadewitz passed away, 5-6 editors have edited the article in different cite formats, and the late Wadewitz is no longer here to state a preference. If you SUPPORT the complete conversion of the remainder of the article in agreement with the Harvard format then indicate this as your SUPPORT, and if you OPPOSE the Harvard format then indicate your preference below.

{{rfcquote|text=
Hello, I would like to report an issue with another user on wikipedia, who has clear bias. He claims the citations being used, which involve [[John Murray (publisher)]] and the [[Calcutta journal]] (a very good journal at the time) are "unreliable", without providing any evidence to support his claim. He made similar reversions on the [[Phulkian misl]] page with the same vacuous reasoning. His edit history suggests he has a religious bias, and I am concerned that he will continually revert valid sources to favour perception of his own culture, which at the time was considered a rival to the clan who this article is concerning. I find it hard to believe this user can make such reversions without procuring any sources to support his claim. I am urging others to please investigate this matter.  

:There is a long-standing consensus that sources from the British Raj era and earlier are not reliable for history, for caste-related matters etc. There are some notes about this at [[User:Sitush/CasteSources]], among other places, and of course there is also information of a more general type at [[WP:HISTRS]]. Please do not reinstate them. And please do not ascribe motives to people without good cause, of which you have none in this instance. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 17:30, 23 September 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
 There is disagreement about whether the article should include lists of individual recent antisemitic incidents. I have argued that these are not noteworthy according to wikipedia standards because Wikipedia is not a newspaper [[WP:NOTNP]] and this seems like a list of recent and not particularly noteworthy or historically significant anti-semitic incidents. Also see [[WP:RECENT]]. I think the content in question will not pass the ten-year test. Other editors disagree with me but we seem to be consistently talking past each other, and it would be good to have some additional eyes on this. See above discussion on [[Talk:Antisemitism in 21st-century France#Don't just list incidents]] and a previous similar RfC at

In 2014 there was a very long discussion on this same talkpage, should [[:Category:People of Middle Eastern descent]] be added to this category. Obviously nobody disagrees that the Middle East is the cradle of Judaism and the Jewish people, but that is not the same. The conclusion of that discussion, in which both sides had several proponents, was that there is no consensus for the "Middle East" category. The category, that was added originally in 2012, was not removed at after that discussion, for reasons that do not matter much at this moment. The arguments against its inclusion remain the same, and are basically two-fold:
# Jews do not consider themselves to be of Middle Eastern descent.
# There have been many proselytes over the ages, making it doubtful (to a very high degree) that any person of Jewish descent is in fact of Middle Eastern descent.

The first point can benefit from some explanation. Jews who emigrated from Germany to, let's say, Israel or the United States, will call themselves German Jews. And the same for Jews from Syria, e.g., who call themselves [[Chalabi Jews]] wherever they are. But that is as far as it goes! Nobody ''knows'' in which countries their forefathers from more than a few generations ago lived, ''and nobody cares''! Certainly, if you'd ask any Jew straightforward, if they are of Middle Eastern decent, nobody would say they are because of the mere fact of being a Jew alone.

To further illustrate this point I retold a known Jewish joke in the previous discussion, about two Jews, let's say both 100% [[Ashkenazic]] Jews, where one tells the other: "Do you know you are an Iraqi Jew?" and then when the other guy vehemently denies he says "All Jews are descended from [[Abraham]] who came from [[Ur]] which is in [[Iraq]]". A similar proof [[ad absurdum]] regards mankind as a whole: most scientific and genetic research agrees that man comes from Africa, and nevertheless, not all "of .. descent" categories are part of "People of African descent", and it would be ridiculous to impose that scientific fact on descent categories, and the same is true in this case. The more so that in this case, where it is not a sure fact at all, in view of the second point regarding proselytes.

I propose to reach a conclusion that there is no place for "Middle East" categories, and per the same token "West Asian" or "Asian" categories, on any of the "Jewish descent" categories. There is at present no conformity on this issue in all of the "Jewish descent" categories, and of the many "Jewish descent" categories, some have one or more of the above. This Rfc strives to reach a conclusion that would be binding for all of them, and in my opinion that conclusion should be that those categories are out of place on all "Jewish descent" categories.

I have discovered a lot of templates that when a user prefers to be "gender-neutral", the template will use "they" instead of "it", which looks like that there are '''multiple''' people using the same account.

These templates include several from the [[Template:UAA|UAA]] series of templates, userboxes like [[Template:User not brave not admin|this]], and others.

I think that we should replace "they"s with "it"s, but want to know whether others agree.

As is the case when candidates make factually inaccurate claims, Wikipedia allows content from reliable sources to correct those claims. The Political positions of Donald Trump[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Donald_Trump] and Political positions of Hillary Clinton[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Hillary_Clinton] are full of this kind of content (just ctrl+F "PolitiFact", "Factcheck.org", "false" and so on). There is therefore no reason to remove the the content in bold which has caught attention by RS and been corrected:

* Stein accepts the scientific consensus on climate change, calling it a "national emergency".<ref name=":03" /> '''''[[FactCheck.org|Factcheck.org]]'' and the Washington Post fact-checker have however found that Stein has exaggerated the extent of projected global sea level rise due to climate change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2016/08/stein-over-the-top-on-sea-level-rise/|title=Stein Over the Top on Sea Level Rise|website=www.factcheck.org|access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/08/17/jill-stein-just-went-overboard-on-sea-level-rise/|title=Jill Stein just went way overboard on sea level rise|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref>''' She has described the [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Agreement]] as inadequate, saying it will not stop climate change.<ref name=":03" /> She has proposed to override the agreement and create a more effective one.<ref name=":03" />
* Stein has argued that the cost of transitioning to 100% renewable energy by 2030 would in part be recouped by healthcare savings, citing the experience of Cuba when it lost Soviet oil subsidies and Cubans experienced improvements in health outcomes.<ref name=":03" /> '''The Washington Post editorial board argued that "she improbably cited Cuba’s experience", noting that Cubans "became healthier because they could no longer afford to smoke or drink alcohol and because so many involuntarily lost weight."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jill-steins-fairy-tale-candidacy/2016/08/25/3bf8ba1a-6b08-11e6-99bf-f0cf3a6449a6_story.html?hpid=hp_no-name_opinion-card-b%253Ahomepage%252Fstory&utm_term=.dac83ae6f609|title=Jill Stein’s fairy-tale candidacy|last=Board|first=Editorial|date=2016-08-25|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref>'''

It is not a violation of neutrality (as Wukai claimed when he removed this content) to correct false and misleading claims that candidates make in support of their positions. Should Donald Trump's false claims about climate change be allowed to stand without correction? If not, why should Stein's? If Clinton can't be allowed to make false claims about healthcare costs, solar energy, charter schools etc., why should Stein be allowed to make misleading health claims about her energy plan?

Should the "Douglas Tottle and Others" section contain the following?
<blockquote>According to Canadian historians, "Eventually Tottle’s book lost credibility in all but the fringe Stalinist circles, but in the late 1980s material from it appeared in the American “Village Voice”<ref name="conlon">[[Jeff Coplon]], [http://www.chss.montclair.edu/English/furr/vv.html "In Search of a Soviet Holocaust"], ''[[The Village Voice]]'', January 12, 1988.</ref> and various student newspapers in Canada" [https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211152/http://www.ukrainianstudies.uottawa.ca/pdf/P_Serbyn_Danyliw07.pdf]. According to [[Cathy Young]], "the West has its own inglorious history with regard to the famine, starting with the deliberate cover-up by Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times correspondent Walter Duranty. In the late 1980s, the famine gained new visibility thanks to [[Robert Conquest]]'s [[The Harvest of Sorrow]]: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine (1987) and the TV documentary Harvest of Despair, aired in the United States and Canada. A backlash from the left was quick to follow. Revisionist Sovietologist [[J. Arch Getty]] accused Conquest of parroting the propaganda of "exiled nationalists." And in January 1988, the [[Village Voice]] ran a lengthy essay by [[Jeff Coplon]] (now a contributing editor at New York magazine) titled "In Search of a Soviet Holocaust: A 55-Year-Old Famine Feeds the Right." Coplon sneered at "the prevailing vogue of anti-Stalinism" and dismissed as absurd the idea that the famine had been created by the Communist regime. Such talk, he asserted, was meant to justify U.S. imperialism and whitewash Ukrainian collaboration with the Nazis."<ref>{{cite web|author=Cathy Young |author-link=Cathy Young |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/861rmjep.asp |title=Remember the Holodomor: The Soviet starvation of Ukraine, 75 years later |volume=14, No. 12 |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=8 December 2008 |accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> In a letter to the editors, [[Robert Conquest]] dismissed the article by Coplon as "error and absurdity".<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Conquest|author-link=Robert Conquest|publisher=Village Voice|location=New York|date=February 2, 1988|title=Letters to the editors|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/16317836/The-Ukrainian-Weekly-198808|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20151118072744/https://www.scribd.com/doc/16317836/The-Ukrainian-Weekly-1988-08|archivedate=18 November 2016}} – Reprinted by the ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'', February 21, 1988</ref></blockquote>

I am in the process of cleaning up this article in hopes of getting it to [[WP:GA]] status. One of the last main things that needs to be addressed is the list of fatalities. Now lets get one thing clear, no one is suggesting the loss of life is not tragic. The question here is does a LIST of those killed warrant placement in this article? If so, how and in what format. I took a look at [[WP:USEPROSE]] (thanks {{user|David Eppstein}} for pointing me there!) and it states ''Prose is preferred in articles as prose allows the presentation of detail and clarification of context, in a way that a simple list may not.'' Now I would like to point out the last 2 words '''''may''' not''. It is possible that a list is still the right format here. I am having a hard time seeing what would be gained by having a bunch of sequential sentences that give the name, age and location of death for each of the 15 people killed. I took a look at a couple of other articles that contain large lists of individuals killed: [[Yarnell Hill Fire]], [[Charles Whitman]] and [[Virginia Tech shooting]]. Each of these use a box on the right side of the page to list the names (not sure what the technical name for this box is... Not an infobox and not a navbox...). I am very much leaning in this direction. 

My proposal is to rewrite the [[Cedar Fire (2003)#Fatalities|fatalities section]] to have a paragraph or so about the causes of death, how the fire spread faster than predicted, how people thought they had time they didn't really have, etc. (All well referenced of course). Then to have a side box that contains a list of the killed to include Name, age and both date and location of death. Perhaps broken up by date. I welcome any and all feedback! --[[User:Zackmann08|<span style="color:DarkTurquoise;">Zackmann08</span>]] (<sup>[[User_talk:Zackmann08|Talk to me]]</sup>/<sub>[[Special:Contributions/Zackmann08|<span style="color:orange;">What I been doing</span>]]</sub>) 02:37, 6 September 2016 (UTC)}}

I think that as a matter of curating this content we need to adopt a firm and straightforward rule for inclusion: I propose that the following criterion is used:
; Each entry must be supported by one or more [[WP:RS|reliable independent sources]] establishing the significance and context of the ribbon campaign. Unsourced entries will be removed.
In fact this should be true of all content in Wikipedia but the issue here is the constant addition of poorly sourced content by well-meaning newcomers so I think we need to establish a precedent of removing unsourced or poorly sourced content. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 09:26, 8 September 2016 (UTC)}}

It is unclear how the addition of "cover versions" and "alt Artist" fields is supposed to benefit song articles.  There are now 15 new fields for "covers": 5 for "alt Artist", 5 for "Recorded by", and 5 for "Performed by".  No guidance was provided and "alt Artist" seems to duplicate the "Recorded by" or "Performed by" fields.  Besides these overlaps, "cover songs" (even the use of the term) is a problem area in song articles.  [[WP:SONGCOVER]], which provides guidelines for the addition of song renditions to articles, is routinely ignored.  Large numbers of "covers", regardless of suitability and lacking sources, are added to articles.  Providing fields for cover versions in the infobox would compound the problem.

Except regarding the merger of Infobox standard with Infobox song,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ATemplates_for_discussion%2FLog%2F2014_July_30&type=revision&diff=620184563&oldid=620184535] the addition of cover versions was not discussed.
On March 16, 2015,&nbsp;"Cover versions" and "alt Artist" were added, along with the infobox standard parameters "Recorded by" and "Performed by".[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AInfobox_song&type=revision&diff=651677830&oldid=604742131][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AInfobox_song%2Fdoc&type=revision&diff=651676326&oldid=604741950] On July 18, 2016, these were expanded to include "alt Artist2–5", "Recorded by2–5", and "Performed by2–5", with the edit note "Support up to 5 cover versions".[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_song&diff=next&oldid=730294138]  Since this is a relatively new addition, it may have seen little or no use, so removing these parameters should not be disruptive and may be cleaned up easily.

I think this section gives as it stands doesn't really clarify what Leninism is nor concerns around the theory. It reads like one side of a debate, when the observer isn't even here for it. I think that the section doesn't belong on this article and instead this should be redirected to criticism of another page or within the page. Furthermore, it doesn't really provide insights into the theory, Leninism, but rather a somewhat non-relevant historical account of what Stalin did wrong. While no doubt an important area of scholarship in its own right doesn't fit when discussing political philosophy of Lenin. It might be good under a page on Stalinism. The Philosophical successor component should be merged, but the exact mentions of a couple smaller communist parties removed and replaced with mentions around Mao Zedong Thought(Maoism) and albeit somewhat fringe: Hoxhaism. I propose delete deleting the existing paragraphs ins in this section and replacing it with the following verbage in bold:

'''In post–[[October Revolution|Revolutionary]] Russia, [[Marxism-Leninism]], which detractors at that time referred to as [[Stalinism]], and [[Trotskyism]] were the immediate principal philosophies of [[Communism]] that claimed legitimate ideological descent from Leninism. This lead to different tendencies to develop as factions within the Communist Party, each ideological faction denied the [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] of the opposing faction.<ref>''Chambers Dictionary of World History'' (2000) p. 837.</ref> In the Soviet Union, [[Marxism-Leninism]] ended up winning authority. This political philosophy was likewise adopted internationally by Communist parties who belonged to the [[Comintern]]. Trotskyism found its voice through its own international forum, called the [[Forth International]].

'''Internationally, in the decades after the death of Lenin other political philosophies claimed descendancy from Leninism, including Mao Zedong thought, otherwise known as [[Maoism]], and [[Hoxhaism]].
'''
'''In academic settings, various fields of international relation studies, such as [[Dependency theory]] and later on [[World System Theory]], have been said to be inspired by Lenin's book [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]].'''

I think this would provide a much more concise section, remove issues around undue weight, remove mentions of small political parties(it would be impossible to provide a full list of every Lenin inspired political party), and allow for a better understanding of the topic. It would also upon up the topic for future expansion from academic fields that utilize Leninist philosophy instead of a debate around the vices and virtues of trotsky and stalin.

Recently, I strove to make this article more neutral by inserting a diagram which plainly shows state subsidy, instead of dividing out the passenger kilometers which is increased to help the operators gain more money, with the effect that passengers must travel in more crowded trains. In this way, it would become apparent that state subsidy for the railway (which is what the diagram says it measures) has actually increased by a dramatic amount; this fact is hidden in the way the current diagram is "normalized". I urge bypassers to remind the coauthors who have obstructed myself of the principles of wikipedia, in particular [[WP:NPOV]], which indicates that diagrams should not be used to make a point for the privatisation by "massaging" them so that the increase in subsidy seems less severe. --[[User:Mathmensch|Mathmensch]] ([[User talk:Mathmensch|talk]]) 11:36, 11 September 2016 (UTC)}}

Is it acceptable to state a broad genre in the opening sentence of a band/musician article? For example: "''[[Metallica]] is an American heavy metal band."'' This scenario assumes that genre is reliably sourced and musical style fully explained later in the body of the article. (Like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica#Style_and_lyrical_themes this].)

In the Personal Section: propose the following be added: "In 1921 Grant moved into the [[Greenwich Village]] apartment of Australian Orry George Kelly, later to be known as the Hollywood designer [[Orry-Kelly]]: the apartment was also shared with a fellow Australian, Charles 'Spangles' Phelps, a cross-dressing performer. Kelly and Grant lived together for five years, and it has been speculated they were lovers, but Kelly lost respect for Grant: he was particularly incensed by Grant's subsequent avoidance of military duty during World War II, and their friendship ended badly."

Proposal: Change Disambiguation and Deletion policy pages to eliminate deletion of two-item disambiguation pages.

IMO, deletion of disambiguation pages based on [[wp:TWODABS]] ''NEVER'' makes sense.  If neither of two exact match items is primary, all should agree the dab is needed.  If one of two is primary, the dab page is not absolutely required, but if it is created, it should be kept.  Why?
*1. Readers seeking the primary use meaning get to it immediately, are unaffected by the dab.
*2. Avoid wasting editors' time in monitoring [[:Category:Disambiguation pages containing one non-primary topic]] to find dabs which can be eliminated, and time wasted by other editors in AFDs and other deletion processes.  
*3. <s>Disambiguation pages are glorified redirects, and [[wp:Redirects are cheap]]</s> Like the essay [[wp:redirects are cheap]] says about redirects, disambiguation pages also "take up minimal disk space and use very little bandwidth. Thus, it doesn't really hurt things if there are a few of them scattered around." (Restated per comments.)
*4. Another exact match may turn up soon, or eventually, and can be added.  
*5. A disambiguation page can hold other items useful to readers that are not exact matches, in the list of items being disambiguation or in "See also".  Readers don't necessarily know their target is not an exact match;  partial matches are helpful.
*6. Technically, we violate Wikipedia's promise to contributors that they will receive credit, each time a two-dabs page is deleted and then recreated later with two or more items.
*7. Deletions of two-dab pages are, like all other deletion actions, a negative that contributors often experience as an insult or dismissal or otherwise as a turnoff.  People need 7 or 8 positives to counter a negative experience.  Negativity drives down participation.

Why not?
*1. Readers seeking the non-primary use meaning will arrive at the primary use topic and, instead of seeing hatnote taking them directly to the non-primary use, they might be directed to the disambiguation page instead, requiring one more step.  '''But''':
**a) If the non-primary use name is long and would make the hatnote unwieldy, readers might already be directed to the disambiguation page, under current policy.
**b) '''We can simply choose not to require the hatnote to go to the disambiguation page.  Change wp:TWODABS to allow it explicity: "If there is only one non-primary use on the dab page, the hatnote can go directly to that."'''

The current process described in [[wp:Disambiguation]]'s [[wp:TWODABS]] section involves tagging TWODABS disambiguation pages with {{tl|Only-two-dabs}}, and allowing deletion if, after some non-defined length of time, other items are not added.  Let's stop the bureaucracy, reduce slightly the pipeline of articles into AFD, stop the slow churning that goes on here, and get rid of one small component of Wikipedia's negativity. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 16:22, 15 September 2016 (UTC)}}

One editor feels that the current summary is enough and that the [[Lexa (The 100)]] article should cover the rest. The other editor feels that the fact that the character's death inspired a national debate, rather than simply a small, localized uproar, and that the character became the face of the "[[bury your gays]]" trope, should be relayed. The edit also shows that two references were removed, but the two references aren't really a deal-beaker in the dispute. More on the dispute is seen above this section on the talk page.

{{rfcquote|text=
In 2014 there was a very long discussion on this same talkpage, should [[:Category:People of Middle Eastern descent]] be added to this category. Obviously nobody disagrees that the Middle East is the cradle of Judaism and the Jewish people, but that is not the same. The conclusion of that discussion, in which both sides had several proponents, was that there is no consensus for the "Middle East" category. The category, that was added originally in 2012, was not removed at after that discussion, for reasons that do not matter much at this moment. The arguments against its inclusion remain the same, and are basically two-fold:
# Jews do not consider themselves to be of Middle Eastern descent.
# There have been many proselytes over the ages, making it doubtful (to a very high degree) that any person of Jewish descent is in fact of Middle Eastern descent.

The first point can benefit from some explanation. Jews who emigrated from Germany to, let's say, Israel or the United States, will call themselves German Jews. And the same for Jews from Syria, e.g., who call themselves [[Chalabi Jews]] wherever they are. But that is as far as it goes! Nobody ''knows'' in which countries their forefathers from more than a few generations ago lived, ''and nobody cares''! Certainly, if you'd ask any Jew straightforward, if they are of Middle Eastern decent, nobody would say they are because of the mere fact of being a Jew alone.

To further illustrate this point I retold a known Jewish joke in the previous discussion, about two Jews, let's say both 100% [[Ashkenazic]] Jews, where one tells the other: "Do you know you are an Iraqi Jew?" and then when the other guy vehemently denies he says "All Jews are descended from [[Abraham]] who came from [[Ur]] which is in [[Iraq]]". A similar proof [[ad absurdum]] regards mankind as a whole: most scientific and genetic research agrees that man comes from Africa, and nevertheless, not all "of .. descent" categories are part of "People of African descent", and it would be ridiculous to impose that scientific fact on descent categories, and the same is true in this case. The more so that in this case, where it is not a sure fact at all, in view of the second point regarding proselytes.

I propose to reach a conclusion that there is no place for "Middle East" categories, and per the same token "West Asian" or "Asian" categories, on any of the "Jewish descent" categories. There is at present no conformity on this issue in all of the "Jewish descent" categories, and of the many "Jewish descent" categories, some have one or more of the above. This Rfc strives to reach a conclusion that would be binding for all of them, and in my opinion that conclusion should be that those categories are out of place on all "Jewish descent" categories.

can the editors use the qualifier "major role" to define the role, or is it [[WP:OR|original research]] to add the phrase without supporting citation? - [[User:Jack Sebastian|Jack Sebastian]] ([[User talk:Jack Sebastian|talk]])

'''Alternative phrasings'''

*'''Leave as is''', the editors should be allowed to evaluate the quality of the role without exact sourcing as to phrasing.
*'''Alternative #1''', "During the mid-1990s, Portman had roles in the films A, B and C and Beautiful Girls, '''garnering significant acclaim with the latte'''r.".
*'''Alternative #2''', "During the mid-1990s, Portman had roles in the films A, B and C. '''Her breakout role came in the 1996 film Beautiful Girls, where she garnered significant acclaim'''."
*'''Alternative #3''',''"'"During the mid-1990s, Portman had roles in the films A, B and C. '''Her performance in the small ensemble film Beautiful Girls garnered significant acclaim."''

'''Note'''

The question of phrasing had been the subject of two earlier RfCs, linked [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Natalie_Portman#RfC:_Is_the_language_biased.3F here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Natalie_Portman#Does_a_.22major.22_role_need_to_be_cited_as_such_by_reliable_sources.3F here]. The first RfC's closing Admin took note of  the poor phrasing of the RfC and that use of the term "major role" was not biased. It was suggested that another, better crafted RfC be submitted to address the matter.<br>
The closing admin on the second RfC noted that, as one word had generated so much debate, it would have been wise to ''"rephrase the sentence altogether, and present the available information in another way."''<sup><small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Natalie_Portman&diff=732520000&oldid=731637535 1]</small></sup>

'''Note'''

There have been three previous discussions on this issue in the last six months, all started by the same editor. Two were RfCs linked above, and an earlier discussions at [[Talk:Natalie Portman/Archive 3#Major roles]]. Also see the discussion immediately above this current RfC at [[Talk:Natalie Portman#Revisiting "a major role" wording]]. The first RfC was closed with the statement "there is a very strong consensus that 'a major role' is not biased." The second RfC was closed with the comment "The rough consensus is that 'major role' is an evaluative qualifier that requires verification, but there is '''no consensus to require exact wording in sources''' as it is often described in different terms in cited sources across BLPs of actors." In all four discussions an important point argued for keeping the current consensus of "major role" is that other means of determining major role, such as Portman's top billing in the film, can be used.
:Er, you do see the notes section immediately above this that says the same thing, right? Your're supposed to present a neutral Notes section, without rendering your opinion.

How should the lead section describe the comments that lead to Watson's resignation from CSHL in 2007?

'''Background'''

The current stable version of the lead of [[James Watson]] describes certain controversial comments that led to Watson's resignation in 2007 thusly:

Over the past months several editors (most recently myself) have attempted to change this wording to one which they argue more accurately represents third party coverage of Watson's comments (diffs: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=721267252&oldid=721260231][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=721450244&oldid=721267252][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=730525194&oldid=730448318][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=730630795&oldid=730525722][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=733157247&oldid=730795729][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=733159191&oldid=733157247][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=739607607&oldid=739097329][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=739629197&oldid=739607607][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=740177315&oldid=739717994][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=740193455&oldid=740177315]). Suggestions have included:
* ...after making controversial comments claiming a link between [[race and intelligence]].
* ...after making controversial comments about the intelligence of Africans and people of African descent.
* Watson resigned this position and was widely shunned after making comments implying black people are less intelligent than others.

These changes have been reverted by others who argue that they are not supported by the sources; or that they imply Watson is racist, and that this violates [[WP:NPOV]], [[WP:BLP]] and/or [[WP:ARBR&I]]. Lengthy discussions on this talk page have failed to resolve the dispute, and we think a wider discussion amongst uninvolved editors is sorely needed.

Hi all. I first founded DRN back in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution_noticeboard&diff=432344305&oldid=432344111 June 2011], and I think it's had a good run over that time. But I wonder if it's still effective. Back then, success rate on DRN was quite high and we had a good amount of volunteers. Nowadays, it seems we only have a handful, with one user doing most of the work {hats off to [[User:Robert McClenon|Robert]] for holding down the fort). That said, success seems quite low. DRN closes disputes for three reasons, successful (resolved successfully), failed (clearly unresolved) and general close (neither successful or unsuccessful, often procedural close due to inactivity/unsuitable request/incorrect forum).

I've done some digging, and here's the stats for this year: 208 cases filed, 8% (16) failed, 6 (3%) were successfully resolved, and the other 186 (89%) were closed for other reasons.

I'm hoping to get input from members of the community here. DRN was once a useful process with many volunteers, but I worry that it might have become too process-oriented and strict, and wonder how much value it's adding. What can we do to improve the process, or if nothing else, what dispute resolution alternatives do we have? <span style="font-family:Verdana;">[[User:Steven Crossin|<span style="color:#078330;">Steven</span>]] [[User talk:Steven Crossin|<span style="color:#2875B0;">Crossin</span>]]</span> 05:38, 31 October 2016 (UTC)}}

Sadly, most of these broad investments are as compromised as the American economy—degraded as it is by the fossil fuel, defense and finance industries." Asked why she did not invest in socially responsible index funds or clean energy funds, Stein said that she had "not yet found the mutual funds that represent my goals of advancing the cause of people, planet and peace".[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/26/jill-stein-s-ideology-says-one-thing-her-investment-portfolio-says-another.html} [[User:Snooganssnoogans|Snooganssnoogans]] ([[User talk:Snooganssnoogans|talk]]) 12:23, 31 October 2016 (UTC)}}

Should England be referred to as an '''erroneous''' metonym for the United Kingdom? (bolded word is the proposal)

We have been unable to reach a consensus on this issue.  I have attempted to add information to the effect that using the word "England" to refer to "the United Kingdom" is incorrect, hence the use of the word erroneous.  This is based on the definition of England as a country which borders Scotland and Wales and which is a constituent, along with those two countries, Northern Ireland and numerous overseas territories, of the United Kingdom.  Referring to a part of a country as the whole is incorrect, much like referring to New York and the whole of the USA.  This may be a colloquialism used in some parts of the world, but minor usage does not imply correctness.

I believe that either this definition should be removed completely, or it should be highlighted here that the usage is incorrect, as including it here seems to be attempted approval of the misuse, which I understand is against the purpose of this website.[[User:Triune|Triune]] ([[User talk:Triune|talk]]) 20:43, 3 October 2016 (UTC)}}

Let's move to [[WP:NOTVOTE|collecting !votes]] so we can actually determine what the consensus is on inclusion of Rocky De La Fuente and Laurence Kotlikoff in the infobox.  Keep in mind the previous consensus that the fundamental infobox inclusion criterion is that it is legally possible for the candidate to win a majority of the votes in the Electoral College, and that write-in access counts in principle (see [[#A call for consensus on McMullin and Castle]] above).  This consensus is not being revisited here.  The question here is what kind of write-in ballot access counts.  The main considerations are:
* Should we continue to require actual documentation that electors have been selected, as was done in 2012? (See [[Talk:United States presidential election, 2016/Archive 12#Auditing the write-in access|#Auditing the write-in access]] above.)
* Should we count the 54 electoral votes from the six "free write-in" states (AL, NH, NJ, PA, RI, VT), which do not have a process for advance filing as a write-in candidate?
* Should there be additional requirements for candidates who need write-in access to get to 270 electoral votes, such as requiring that they have on-ballot access for a certain number of states or electoral votes?

The wording on this template is a bit awkward and not adapted. The current text is:

<blockquote>This article contains one or more [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Lists#Incomplete lists|incomplete lists]] which may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by [{{fullurl:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|action=edit}} expanding it{{\}}them] with entries that are [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliably sourced]].</blockquote>

I propose a new parameter and usage for articles that have multiple lists:

* <code><nowiki>{{Dynamic a-list|plural}}</nowiki></code>
* <code><nowiki>{{Dynamic a-list|plural=yes}}</nowiki></code> (alternative syntax)

This template could use a parameter <code>plural</code> to display the following message for multiple lists in article:

<blockquote>This article contains multiple [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Lists#Incomplete lists|incomplete lists]] which may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by [{{fullurl:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|action=edit}} expanding them] with entries that are [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliably sourced]].</blockquote>

In addition, the parameter syntax <code>plural=no</code> could be used to create the following message:

<blockquote>This article contains an [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Lists#Incomplete lists|incomplete list]] which may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by [{{fullurl:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|action=edit}} expanding it] with entries that are [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliably sourced]].</blockquote>

The text without the plural parameter can be left as-is, mainly also for compatibility reasons and ease of use/ambiguity. <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> statements can be considered to be supported as well.

Additionally, can Wikipedia suggest me a reasonable way to ask our editors  - a question continuously deleted from the Ref desk by two editors - who ''mistakenly'' think my question is not genuine?

Today, I asked a question at the reference desk <small>(for details about the question, see the last section below, in small letters)</small>.
Unfortunately, two editors who - ''instead of assuming a good faith'' - thought my question was not genuine, deleted it from the Ref desk, while adding a comment - on the summary edit - that there was no way to answer my question. However, I think that - instead of their deleting a (legitimate) question from the ref desk - they should have written their (unnecessarily correct) comment ''on the ref desk'', and should have let other editors try to answer my (legitimate) question.

<small>Actually, what happened was the following: Today I noticed, that some people had used the connection between the word Trump and the word trumpet, e.g. [http://spectator.org/let-trump-be-trumpet/ in this paper], so I wanted to know whether anybody before me has also noticed the connection between Trump's name and Trump's rival's husband's expertise in playing trumpet. I innocently asked about that - at the reference desk, but unfortunately my question was deleted (instead of assuming a good faith).</small>

'''Proposals'''

'''A: PC1 protection for all articles'''

'''Implement Level 1 Pending Changes protection for all articles.''' The protection itself would be performed by a bot created for this purpose. 

This solution would keep the general public from seeing vandalism or statements that are unsourced/poorly-written, perhaps saving Wikipedia the periodic public embarrassment it has to deal with whenever hoaxes and vandalism are viewed by readers (consider the [http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/hillary-clinton-wikipedia-hacked/ widespread media attention] that Wikipedia recently received after [[Hillary Clinton]]'s article was replaced with an obscene image).  

''It is important to recognize that PC1 protection would not keep anyone from actually editing any page. It would simply require that a reviewer approve article edits by an anonymous or non-autoconfirmed user.''

'''Support A'''

#'''Strong Support'''. Long overdue. Globally, Wikipedia is the seventh most popular website. Millions upon millions of people rely on it every day for basic information. But yet we continue with a policy of letting any random person add anything they want on almost any article (even our most highly-viewed or highly-prized ones) without even reviewing most of those edits or requiring sources for them. We have no way of knowing how many inaccurate statements may exist on Wikipedia already, due to our ''laissez-faire'' quality requirements, and spreading potentially inaccurate or biased information to millions of people is no laughing matter, especially in subjects such as medicine. Such misinformation can have dangerous real-life effects, and it is our moral responsibility to take action to prevent such things.<p>Wikipedia has been publicly embarrassed many times, such as when [http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/hillary-clinton-wikipedia-hacked/ a highly-visible article is grossly vandalized], or when hoaxes or inaccurate information are discovered to have existed for a long time on some articles. Wikipedia itself has a [[Reliability_of_Wikipedia#Notable_incidents|list of such incidents]]. It is long past time that this endless cycle stop. Why do we keep letting this happen? There's an old saying which says that "insanity is doing is the same thing over and over again and expecting different results." No one person is to blame for this, but what is to blame is the general anti-change environment.<p>So these problems are very much fixable, if we simply become willing to try new things and wake up to the need for common-sense changes. And this proposal is one of the simplest, low-impact, most common-sense way to start. '''An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'''

This '''Pending Changes expansion RfC''' consists of several proposals regarding [[WP:PC|pending changes protection]]. 

The first two proposals concern the expansion of [[WP:PC1|Level 1 PC protection]] to either all articles or only ones of the highest quality and/or importance. PC1 protection requires that a reviewer approve any revision by an anonymous or non-autoconfirmed user before it becomes visible to the general public. The aim of these proposals is to ensure that the general public does not see vandalism, inaccurate/unsourced statements, or poorly-written content. In this way, Wikipedia's quality could hopefully be stabilized somewhat, allowing editors to eliminate backlogs without worrying about the backlog increasing yet again.

The third proposal would help PC reviewers deal with the increased backlog by means of more efficient reviewing systems.

As with all other RfCs, this RfC will run for thirty days.

However, this information has been deleted from her page.

The site http://www.wiseshe.com/2013/05/10-most-beautiful-indian-women.html ranks Mumtaz as one of the 10 most beautiful Indian women. 
When Mumtaz was active in Hindi Cinema, Internet was unheard of. So, whatever critical information about her professional life is available, is actually in print media. Transcripts of some of the articles are available at www.angelfire.com/celeb/mumtaz/articles.html. Other sources are the sites which have been created with memories of various persons following her life; her interviews; or information from her family members, etc. However the information exchanged in communications would hardly be available in print. It's not only impossible but also unethical to record the conversations. Hence, there would a large amount of information which cannot be cross-referenced tangibly. Anyway, let's have look at a single article where every word, every phrase, every sentence, and every para is cross-referenced!

The statement that "Jeetendra and Mumtaz acted in a number of films together, including unsuccessful films such as ''Boond Jo Ban Gai Moti'' (1967), ''Himmat'', ''Kathputli'', and ''Roop Tera Mastana'', as well as successful one such as ''Jigri Dost'' (1969), ''Humjoli'' (where Mumtaz had a cameo role) and ''Ek Naari Ek Brahmchari'' (1971). Mumtaz also acted opposite Feroz Khan in ''Aag'' (1967), ''Aadmi Aur Insaan'', ''Upaasna'', ''Mela'', ''Apradh'', and ''Nagin''; and with Sanjay Khan in ''Upasana'', ''Dhadkan'', ''Mela''" does not seen contentious at all.

What's wrong in including the site "www.mumtaz.in" or "www.angelfire.com/celeb/mumtaz" which quotes a number of print media which are the national film magazines of India? [[User:Juhi47|Juhi47]] ([[User talk:Juhi47|talk]]) 09:52, 7 November 2016 (UTC)}}

[[File:Pierre Bourdieu.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Bourdieu Strasbourg crop.jpg|thumb]]
The discussion at hand concerns whether this image of Bourdieu should be in the infobox: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Pierre_Bourdieu.jpg

Or this one: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Bourdieu_Strasbourg_crop.jpg

Why do I believe the former image is better than the latter? As I noted in my latest revision summary: it is aesthetically and functionally better, for it is not a grainy, cropped image taken from a random meeting with other people. It is professional and shows him speaking. It is moreover also the image used on all the other major language versions of the article (French, Spanish, Italian, etc.). Finally it shows him as he was best known to the public appearance-wise; the other image is of him when he was already quite old and shows him in a way that does not fit the public impression of him as established throughout his career (just do a google image search for him).

There are also downsides for that picture, however. It is somewhat blurry, and I hope someone with the requisite Photoshop skills can produce a better version of it as that is one of the main arguments I've seen from those who prefer the other image.

If better arguments are presented for why the other image is better, I am all ears and am open to changing my mind, as I hope others are as well, in particular when a better version of the first image is presented.

There is an increase of the need of a '''Notability criteria for volleyball players''' since there are a lot of recent creation of BLP and clubs with dubious relevance. I would like to introduce this proposal:
;Volleyball players and head coachs are deemed notable if they meet any of the criteria below:
# Has competed in the [[Olympics]], [[FIVB World Cup|World Cup]], [[FIVB Club World Championship|Club World Championship]] or senior [[FIVB Volleyball World Championship|World Championships]].
# Has won a medal at one of the following competitions: [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Champions Cup|World Grand Champions Cup]], [[FIVB Volleyball World League|World League]], [[FIVB World Grand Prix|World Grand Prix]], [[Goodwill Games]], [[Pan American Games]], [[Commonwealth Games]], [[Asian Games]], and any Senior Continental Championship.
# Has won a gold medal at the senior level at any other major elite international event (e.g. the [[All-Africa Games]], [[South American Games]]).
# Has been inducted into <s>a major hall of fame, such as</s> the [[Volleyball Hall of Fame]].
Note: College and youth players <s>are not notable unless they satisfy one of the statements above, or if they can be shown to meet the wider</s> will follow [[WP:NCOLLATH]] or the requirements of [[WP:GNG]].

I know that professional leagues and league players are being left for this proposal and an item about it should be added. Something like:
#Players who have played, and managers who have managed in a fully professional league, will generally be regarded as notable. See a [[WP:FPL|list of fully professional leagues kept by WikiProject Football]].
Another item that should be covered is beach volleyball. It should be something like:
;Beach volleyball players are deemed notable if they meet any of the criteria below:
# Has competed in the [[Beach volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], [[FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships|World Championship]] and the [[FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour|World Tour]].
# Has won a medal at one of the following competitions: [[Pan American Games]], [[Commonwealth Games]], [[Asian Games]], and any Senior Continental Championship
# Has been inducted into <s>a major hall of fame, such as</s> the [[Volleyball Hall of Fame]].
Please let finish the discussion with a solid criteria. I hope this is not left unattended. --[[User talk:Osplace|Osplace]] 15:42, 19 October 2016 (UTC)}}

Should the naming convention for this tree be "Culture '''of''' City" or "Culture '''in''' City"? My understanding was always that consensus had been established as "of", but after reviewing this category and the various country-specific subcategories in {{cl|Culture by nationality and city}}, I'm finding a much closer split than I expected — there are 305 ''ofs'', 238 ''ins'', and a handful of outliers that will have to be renamed either way because they're using non-standard formats like "City culture". (There was also one case, and I'm surprised not more, where "Culture of city" and "Culture in city" ''both'' existed for the same city — given the circumstances, I've temporarily merged them both into the form that was otherwise the "norm" in its ''own'' country, although obviously it can be renamed the other way if consensus settles on the other form.)

;Summary of issue
There has been debates, reverts, and contentious editing regarding the lead of this BLP (see the above talk page sections: [[#Accusations of sexual misconduct in lead section]], [[#Removal of sexual misconduct allegations]], [[#RFC:Recent allegations in lede]], [[#Potential paragraph at end of lede on sex abuse allegations]], [[#Concern about the lede]], [[#Sentence on sexual misconduct in lede paragraph on campaign]], and [[#Access Hollywood tape in lead section]]). 

There are multiple objections and issues raised, but they all center around the inclusion or exclusion of allegations of sexual misconduct, harassment, assault, and crimes by Trump against a number of women. The relevant information in the body of the article can primarily be found at [[Donald Trump#Presidential campaign, 2016|§ Presidential campaign, 2016]], which summaries the fuller article [[Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations]]. 

So far, the issues raise have been about (1) the existence of any mention in the [[WP:LEAD|lede]] and (2) the length of any such mention. Regarding (2), among those who think it should be included, some have suggested only one or two sentences be added while other suggest a stand-alone paragraph is warranted. Specific policies and guidelines raised in previous discussions include [[WP:DUE|due weight]], [[WP:RECENTISM|recentism]], [[WP:LEAD|lede guidelines]], potential [[WP:BLP|biography of living persons]] violations, and adherence to a [[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]].

Examples of past lede edits: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_Trump&diff=744499671&oldid=744494313 paragraphs], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_Trump&diff=744864859&oldid=744863901 paragraph], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_Trump&diff=744763397&oldid=744758492 sentence].

;Need for this RfC
Current discussions are disjointed, redundant, and contentious. Some attempts at consensus-building and !voting have been relative unfruitful. It is unclear if there is [[WP:CONSENSUS|consensus]] for anything. Unlike straw polls and other !votes, an RfC can help bring in new editors to voice their opinions and (hopefully) generate a stronger consensus. Per a request in the above section, I am making a good-faith attempt at creating a neutrally-worded RfC to assess consensus on the aforementioned issues. If you feel I have not adequately or correctly summarized the debate, please feel free to suggest clarification or changes to the background infomation. Because of the complicated nature of the issues and past discussion, please forgive my multi-question RfC. It is the only way I can see any RfC addressing the core issues and making any headway.

;Questions
#Should the lede of this BLP include any summary of the allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump?
#If the material is included, to what extent should it be covered in the lead?

This discussion is about the formatting of the awards table on the page. 

*'''Option A''' is to maintain the current single table. The reasoning given is that the table is sortable, allowing a user to sort through all of the awards, by year, type, recipient and outcome, allowing easier searching of particular items, for instance all awards won by Peter Dinklage.
*'''Option B''' is to use multiple tables as found in many other list articles, separating the awards by type, i.e. a table for Emmy's, a table for Golden Globes, etc, with the table focusing on that particular brand of awards.

I've had enough of my pictures reverted by Nightscream to know how the discussion will go with him alone, so I am creating this RFC. I placed an updated picture of Jaffee taken at his birthday celebration last year. This stayed up for a while but was then reverted to an earlier picture, which I think was inferior. I don't feel I need to explain why, as it would (I thought) be obvious. The photo was removed with a comment about the shadow - it looks fine on the monitors I've checked, but if someone wants to adjust the contrast, I wouldn't object obviously.

The dispute can be found at [[Talk:Barack Obama religion conspiracy theories#Judgement of theological claims]]. The language of the lede section describes the subsequent information of the article body as "false." However, the article contains two distinct types of information: claims that are verifiable (i.e. those pertaining to Obama's religious beliefs) and those that are theological and unverifiable (i.e. what Obama represents to various religions or persons, e.g. "the antichrist). The dispute is whether both of those can be called false while complying with [[WP:NPOV]] or just the former.

{{rfcquote|text=
'''Proposal: Change Disambiguation and Deletion policy pages to eliminate deletion of two-item disambiguation pages.'''

IMO, deletion of disambiguation pages based on [[wp:TWODABS]] ''NEVER'' makes sense.  If neither of two exact match items is primary, all should agree the dab is needed.  If one of two is primary, the dab page is not absolutely required, but if it is created, it should be kept.  Why?
*1. Readers seeking the primary use meaning get to it immediately, are unaffected by the dab.
*2. Avoid wasting editors' time in monitoring [[:Category:Disambiguation pages containing one non-primary topic]] to find dabs which can be eliminated, and time wasted by other editors in AFDs and other deletion processes.  
*3. <s>Disambiguation pages are glorified redirects, and [[wp:Redirects are cheap]]</s> Like the essay [[wp:redirects are cheap]] says about redirects, disambiguation pages also "take up minimal disk space and use very little bandwidth. Thus, it doesn't really hurt things if there are a few of them scattered around." (Restated per comments.)
*4. Another exact match may turn up soon, or eventually, and can be added.  
*5. A disambiguation page can hold other items useful to readers that are not exact matches, in the list of items being disambiguation or in "See also".  Readers don't necessarily know their target is not an exact match;  partial matches are helpful.
*6. Technically, we violate Wikipedia's promise to contributors that they will receive credit, each time a two-dabs page is deleted and then recreated later with two or more items.
*7. Deletions of two-dab pages are, like all other deletion actions, a negative that contributors often experience as an insult or dismissal or otherwise as a turnoff.  People need 7 or 8 positives to counter a negative experience.  Negativity drives down participation.

Why not?
*1. Readers seeking the non-primary use meaning will arrive at the primary use topic and, instead of seeing hatnote taking them directly to the non-primary use, they might be directed to the disambiguation page instead, requiring one more step.  '''But''':
**a) If the non-primary use name is long and would make the hatnote unwieldy, readers might already be directed to the disambiguation page, under current policy.
**b) '''We can simply choose not to require the hatnote to go to the disambiguation page.  Change wp:TWODABS to allow it explicity: "If there is only one non-primary use on the dab page, the hatnote can go directly to that."'''

The current process described in [[wp:Disambiguation]]'s [[wp:TWODABS]] section involves tagging TWODABS disambiguation pages with {{tl|Only-two-dabs}}, and allowing deletion if, after some non-defined length of time, other items are not added.  Let's stop the bureaucracy, reduce slightly the pipeline of articles into AFD, stop the slow churning that goes on here, and get rid of one small component of Wikipedia's negativity.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should the lead of the article on [[Johannes Brahms]] include the statement "He was a master of counterpoint, the complex and highly disciplined art for which Johann Sebastian Bach is famous"? 

This sentence was included by [[User:Marlindale|Marlindale]] in the paragraph describing Brahms's compositional style. [[User:Tony1|Tony]] deleted the sentence, contending that this is "a highly dubious claim in the text that counterpoint was central to Brahms's style" and that "To mount a case in a 'balanced' summary article that counterpoint was central to Brahms's style is, I believe, inappropriate."

I disputed this contention, noting that virtually all the musicologists who have written about Brahms's work have noted his extensive use of counterpoint as an essential element in his style. [[User:Ravpapa|Ravpapa]] ([[User talk:Ravpapa|talk]]) 07:37, 20 October 2016 (UTC)}}

The [[Wikipedia:Non-admin closure]] is an oft-quoted essay amongst editors frequenting deletion discussions. The discussions about upgrading this to an essay perhaps first took place in the [[Wikipedia talk:Non-admin closure#essay vs guideline|year 2008]] and ended with no consensus to upgrade the same; one reason was the instruction creep within the current essay. Another reason was that the essay, at least in the opinion of some, had a few statements that went against current policy.

*Should the [[Wikipedia:Non-admin closure]] essay be upgraded to guideline status, with the community working on the essay thereon to reduce the instruction creep and modifying any statements imminently conflicting with current deletion policy?

However, this information has been deleted from her page.

The site http://www.wiseshe.com/2013/05/10-most-beautiful-indian-women.html ranks Mumtaz as one of the 10 most beautiful Indian women. 
When Mumtaz was active in Hindi Cinema, Internet was unheard of. So, whatever critical information about her professional life is available, is actually in print media. Transcripts of some of the articles are available at www.angelfire.com/celeb/mumtaz/articles.html. Other sources are the sites which have been created with memories of various persons following her life; her interviews; or information from her family members, etc. However the information exchanged in communications would hardly be available in print. It's not only impossible but also unethical to record the conversations. Hence, there would a large amount of information which cannot be cross-referenced tangibly. Anyway, let's have look at a single article where every word, every phrase, every sentence, and every para is cross-referenced!

The statement that "Jeetendra and Mumtaz acted in a number of films together, including unsuccessful films such as ''Boond Jo Ban Gai Moti'' (1967), ''Himmat'', ''Kathputli'', and ''Roop Tera Mastana'', as well as successful one such as ''Jigri Dost'' (1969), ''Humjoli'' (where Mumtaz had a cameo role) and ''Ek Naari Ek Brahmchari'' (1971). Mumtaz also acted opposite Feroz Khan in ''Aag'' (1967), ''Aadmi Aur Insaan'', ''Upaasna'', ''Mela'', ''Apradh'', and ''Nagin''; and with Sanjay Khan in ''Upasana'', ''Dhadkan'', ''Mela''" does not seen contentious at all.

What's wrong in including the site "www.mumtaz.in" or "www.angelfire.com/celeb/mumtaz" which quotes a number of print media which are the national film magazines of India? [[User:Juhi47|Juhi47]] ([[User talk:Juhi47|talk]]) 09:52, 7 November 2016 (UTC)}}

An editor has argued that films are being placed in the [[hebephilia]] category when they are not about hebephilia and/or the characters are not hebephiles (which are people with a sexual preference for young pubescents, and not merely the case of people committing [[statutory rape]]) and that the additions are therefore [[WP:Original research]] violations. Another another editor has argued that some of the films should be included, that the additions aid navigation and that it's better that these films are placed in the hebephilia category instead of being wrongly placed [[:Category:Films about pedophilia]]. The editor is, however, unsure about whether some films should be placed in the category. If we look at the [[L.I.E.]] article, for example, we see that it was categorized as a film about hebephilia, while the lead [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=L.I.E.&diff=746680388&oldid=740102106 once categorized] the character in question as an [[ephebophile]] and the reception section calls him a [[pedophile]]. So should we allow editors to categorize these films based on their own judgment? Or should the films be removed if there are no reliable sources identifying the films as being about hebephilia? Should films only be included if they fit the hebephilia definition (which is the sexual preference for young pubescents, rather than an act of statutory rape)?

There's a slow-motion edit war going on between me (sorry) and an unregistered user who keeps hopping IPs, making communication difficult. For that reason, here's a thread for discussing the issue behind the revert cycle.

*In September 2016, Euronews apparently ceased to be listed on the [[Freesat]] EPG. Nobody has been able to find a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] for this, but there we go.
*The IP user wishes to add the words "after the Brexit vote" (or similar) to the sentence in question. Yeah, it did happen after the Brexit vote, but so did a lot of things.
*I believe that adding the words "after the Brexit vote" implicitly links the two events.
*Nobody, myself included, has been able to find a reliable source that links these two events. Debates on various forums do not count according to Wikipedia rules.
*The IP user asserts that it is the responsibility of the person removing the unreferenced text to find a source that agrees with them. Of course, proving a negative is impossible and that way lies madness.
*The slow motion edit war is staying just under the [[WP:3RR|3RR]] for now, but eventually one of us will cross that bright red line; the IP has the advantage as they will just shift IPs if blocked. I can't.

If PL/I is unsupported, what needs to be done to support it? I would think that, since the article apperance is the same, the source tag would be preferable siince the markup could always be updated later.

Hello Wiki community, this is Jack, I work for Edelman in London, UK.

To begin with, I just want to disclose that Lord Myners is our chairman, so there is a COI here. However, after reading this Wiki entry and seeing this is listed as 'Start Class', I feel that the page can be enhanced with additional factual and encyclopaedic detail. 

It also has some now out of date information. I hope we can work together to present a more complete edition of this entry. As an employee of Edelman, I have not and will not edit the article. Particularly as I do not want to cause any reason to question the neutrality of this article. However, as a person with links to Paul Myners, I would like to provide additional detail. I’ve compiled a few thoughts for potential additions to this posting, including links to 3rd party sources to help maintain factual accuracy.



I think it is relevant to add to the lead section that as well as being made a life peer in consequence of his appointment, he also was made a Member of the Upper House of Parliament. It seems unnecessary to say he’s non elected as it’s implied from ‘by consequence of his appointment’ so this is repetition. He joined the Lords on 16th October 2008 and now sits as a crossbencher – another fact that seems quite worthy of inclusion.
[Parliament website referencing Paul’s current status in the Lords:  [http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/lord-myners/3869]

Just moving on to his background and personal life, it states his political views are not known. While I won’t dispute this – I do have source material saying he views himself as a ‘progressive liberal’. This would seem worthy of inclusion.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v-yvOPKp3RkC&pg=PT99&lpg=PT99&dq=paul+myners+liberal+progressive&source=bl&ots=FB4b1lSG_Y&sig=EoEfDjRs83JyeymKPpNn2t8t6Ko&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDn6uA8YTQAhUi2oMKHU2-ADsQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&q=paul%20myners%20liberal%20progressive&f=false]

It’s also prudent to point out that Alison Macleod is now a former chair of the Institute of Contemporary Art; and that Paul Myners has residences in London and near Falmouth, as well as five children.

Initial Telegraph article announces Alison Macleod’s appointment, while the second confirms that Donald Moore is the current Chair

{{rfcquote|text=
It has been suggested (above, at [[#Philip "Phil" Chess]]) that the example and wording [[WP:QUOTENAME]] regarding the presentation of nicknames and [[hypocorism]]s (diminutives) is not entirely clear, thus leaving open whether an article such as (for instance) [[Tom Petty]] Should begin {{xt|'''Thomas Earl '''"'''Tom'''"''' Petty''' is...}} or just {{xt|'''Thomas Earl Petty''' is...}} (with the "Tom" being implied by the article title and the fact that it's an obvious and very common shortening of "Thomas").  

To avoid endless confusion and discussion and contention, let's clarify what is intended here and nail this down one way or another. (I used <u>underlines</u> to show both additions and changes.)

The '''current wording''' of the operative paragraph in [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section#Usage in first sentence]] is:</br>
:{{xt|The name of a person is presented in full if known, including any given names that are not included in the article's title or are abbreviated there. For example, the article on [[Calvin Coolidge]] gives his name as '''John Calvin Coolidge, Jr.''' If a person has a commonly known nickname, used in lieu of a given name, it is presented between quote marks following the last given name or initial, as for [[John F. Kennedy]], which has '''John Fitzgerald''' "'''Jack'''" '''Kennedy'''. The quotation marks are not put in bold. A nickname that comes in place of the whole name should be presented after the full name, in parentheses. Also acceptable are formulations like "'''Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi''', better known as '''Sandro Botticelli'''", when applicable.}}
</br></br>
'''Proposal 1''' is to clarify that both common [[hypocorism]]s (diminutives) ''and'' nicknames are to be included (in quote marks) in the initial presentation of the name:</br>
:{{xt|The name of a person is presented in full if known, including any given names that are not included in the article's title or are abbreviated there. For example, the article on [[Calvin Coolidge]] gives his name as '''John Calvin Coolidge, Jr.''' If a person <u>is</u> commonly known <u>by a</u> [[nickname]] <u>or [[hypocorism]]</u>, used in lieu of a given name, it is presented between quote marks following the last given name or initial, as for <u>[[Tom Petty]]</u>, which has <u>'''Thomas Earl '''"'''Tom'''"''' Petty'''</u>. The quotation marks are not put in bold. A nickname that comes in place of the whole name should be presented after the full name, in parentheses. Also acceptable are formulations like "'''Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi''', better known as '''Sandro Botticelli'''", when applicable.}}
</br></br>
'''Proposal 2''' is to differentiate between common hypocorisms and other nicknames, and to proscribe writing the hypocorism (diminutive) when it is common and obvious:</br>
:{{xt|The name of a person is presented in full if known, including any given names that are not included in the article's title or are abbreviated there. For example, the article on [[Calvin Coolidge]] gives his name as '''John Calvin Coolidge, Jr.''' If a person <u>is</u> commonly known <u>by a</u> [[nickname]] <u>that is not a common [[hypocorism]]</u>, used in lieu of a given name, it is presented between quote marks following the last given name or initial, as for <u>[[Bunny Berigan]]</u>, which has <u>'''Roland Bernard '''"'''Bunny'''"''' Berigan'''</u>. The quotation marks are not put in bold. <u>If a person has a well-known common [[hypocorism]], used in lieu of a given name, it is ''not'' presented between quote marks following the last given name or initial, as for [[Tom Hopper]] which has '''Thomas Edward Hopper'''.</u> Also acceptable are formulations like "'''Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi''', better known as '''Sandro Botticelli'''", when applicable.}}
</br></br>
:For Proposal 2, it is also suggested to include a footnote in the Notes section, with the link at "commonly used hypocorism" above: <small>{{xt|As a guide to what is a "common" hypocorism, consider consulting the [[Hypocorism#English]] subsections "Shortening, often to the first syllable" and "Addition of a diminutive suffix..."; consider treating names listed in the in "A short form that differs significantly from the name" subsection as non-hypocoristic nicknames, depending on the particular case (a few short forms that differ significantly from the name are well known common hypocorisms, such as "Bob" for "Robert", but most are not.}}</small> [[User:Herostratus|Herostratus]] ([[User talk:Herostratus|talk]]) 17:31, 3 November 2016 (UTC)}}

In [[Talk:Center_for_Security_Policy#Should_the_BBC.27s_description_of_the_CSP_be_Included.3F|this RfC]] it was determined that the specific description of the CSP as "not very highly respected" must be included in the article's lede. There is now disagreement as to where it should be placed in the lede between two alternate versions. Which of the two contested versions should be used? 
:'''Version A:''' The Center for Security Policy (CSP) is a "not very highly respected" Washington, D.C.-based national security think tank that has been widely accused of engaging in conspiracy theorizing by a range of individuals, media outlets and organizations. Its activities are focused on exposing and researching perceived jihadist threats to the United States. The Center has been described as "disreputable" by Salon and the Southern Poverty Law Center designated the CSP as a hate group in 2016. It has faced strong criticism from people across the political spectrum, but has also had its reports cited by political figures such as Donald Trump and Michele Bachmann.

 allows the community to educate companies upfront and directly that promotional editing is not allowed under any username. Additionally, some companies – especially paid editing firms – would continue to create new, nondescript usernames anyway to evade scrutiny, defeating the purpose of the proposal. Finally, the kind of companies who would most likely create such shared, role accounts are non-notable and unsuitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, making it pointless for them to continue editing here.

::One potential area to move forward on is improving the connection between soft-blocked usernames that imply shared use and the new usernames that are created as a result of those blocks. A few proposed suggestions include a software change that forces a user to change their username on their next login (supported by {{U|WereSpielChequers}} and {{U|MER-C}}) and creating a policy of coming back under a account like “John123 (WidgetsInc)” (a brainstormed suggestion by {{U|Ks0stm}}). This would allow us to continue the goal of educating users about COI editing while eliminating the need for shared accounts. I would encourage further discussion along those lines if this is something that we want.

Should it be presented as a music genre and placed in band infoboxes? It is basically a term that appears in a few publications on progressive rock (sometimes in quotes or in sentences like "X could be termed post-progressive") and that is not widely used or recognized as such; there are no bands commonly described as ''post-progressive''. It was also placed in a number of infoboxes on music genres (eg. in [[jazz]] and [[ambient music]]) and in the lead in [[progressive rock]], perhaps giving it undue importance. An article on this topic was [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Post-prog|deleted in 2006]]. Another issue is that the sources listed use ''post-progressive'' as an adjective - should the article use it as a noun as it currently does?

{{quote|Literally no one uses the Certification parameter anymore, it's completely redundant.

The existing language at that time:

Any new writing, including article drafts and talk-page comments, can be freely copied, modified, deleted, reproduced, altered and quoted by third parties for commercial and non-commercial use, with the sole requirement that the work be attributed to Wikipedia contributors.</blockquote>

Was initially  changed and then changed further, and and is currently):

<blockquote>'''Copyright of paid contributions
{{see|Work for hire}}
Editors are reminded that any text they contribute to Wikipedia, assuming they own the copyright, is irrevocably licensed under a [[WP:CC-BY-SA|Creative Commons-Attribution-Sharealike]] license and the [[WP:GFDL|GNU Free Documentation License]]. Content on Wikipedia, including article drafts and talk-page comments, can be freely copied and modified by third parties for commercial and non-commercial use, with the sole requirement that it be attributed to Wikipedia contributors.

Paid editors must ensure that they own the copyright of text they have been paid to add to Wikipedia. If the text is a [[work for hire]], the copyright resides with the person or organization that paid for it ("the employer"). Otherwise the text's author is assumed to be the copyright holder. It is important not to assume that the paid editor is the author, because companies may provide paid editors with approved texts.

Paid editors, the employer, or the author should forward a release to the Wikimedia Foundation (<code>permissions@wikimedia.org</code>). The release must include the name(s) of the author and copyright holder, and that the copyright holder has released the text under a free licence. See [[WP:PERMISSION]] for how to do this.</blockquote>

The notion in the  3rd paragraph that paid editors should always -- whether they own the copyright in the proposed content or not -- forward a release to the Wikimedia Foundation, was discussed at the talk page of the Copyright policy, also in December 2015 starting the same day the content was initially added.  That discussion is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Copyrights/Archive_15#Works_for_hire here].

I have proposed to combine and change the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs to read as follows:

<blockquote>If the copyright for a text that a paid editor wishes to add to Wikipedia is owned by someone else (such as the paid editor's employer), the paid editor is responsible for ensuring that they have the right to grant the required license for the content, or that the copyright owner has granted permission for the content to be used in Wikipedia. See [[WP:PERMISSION]] for instructions.</blockquote>

That version does not include the general obligation but makes it clear that paid editors, like everyone, are responsible for getting clearance to add content to WP that they don't own.

The question:   Should paid editors always be obligated to have copyright permission sent to WMF for content they wish to add to WP, whether they own it or not?  [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]] ([[User talk:Jytdog|talk]]) 20:51, 15 December 2016 (UTC)}}

Still other feelings are that Trump has not held prior political office. Another feeling is that mentioning politician if the only political office held is president because it is redundant.

An examination of other articles of Presidents show that generally they are not called politicians in the lead.

This discussion was prompted by the Trump article but is brought here for the improvement of all Wikipedia presidential articles.

{{rfcquote|text=
I would like to put forward an important discussion in regards to the information that has been put out in the articles that cover each series of ''The Apprentice (UK)''. This discussion is an important one that needs to be looked into, as I, an editor for this site, have begun to question whether the information in these articles is encyclopedic, or whether the articles are beginning to become treated as a Blog, which Wikipedia is not designed as.  As an editor who has worked on these pages, I have been a part of adding in information to discuss the respective episodes, but have begun to question whether the information being put in by myself, and other editors, regardless of whether it is later changed, added to, or deleted, is now really relevant, and more importantly sticks to Wikipedia's principle of providing encyclopedic information.

The chief problem on these articles is in regards to information on episodes.  The layout for this information is that it states the Air Date for each episode in each series, the teams and their candidates within, the task being undertaken on that episode and a review of what happened, results of the task and who won and what they were rewarded with, who was brought back to the final boardroom, who was fired or left, the panellist for the sister show that came after that episode, and notes in regards to events in the episode (i.e. a candidate who made a mistake and tried to lie about it).

Other information in this article, from the lead, the candidate and weekly results, criticism and controversy, and ratings, appears to be fine, with some area certainly backed by citations to prove it.  What I want to know is this - Should the information within the Episode section of each article for these series, be changed or stick to the way it is presented? Does it constitute as being a Blog and thus go against [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]] in regards to this?  And if the first two questions generate "Yes" as an answer, would changing it to listing the episodes in a table, keeping the Air Date and the episode's title, and writing out a short summary of the episode (as with most TV programmes), be more appropriate?

I await word from others on what they think. [[User:GUtt01|GUtt01]] ([[User talk:GUtt01|talk]]) 23:03, 17 November 2016 (UTC)}}

For those who don't know, the [[User:StatisticianBot|bot]] that previously updated [[Wikipedia:Good article nominations/Report]] has been down for some time. I'm currently working on a replacement, [[User:WugBot|WugBot]] (see [[Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/WugBot|BRFA]]). [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] and I have been [[User_talk:Wugapodes#WugBot_output|discussing]] where the links on that page should point to. Currently I have it set up so that the links go directly to the review page of the article (if it exists, to the talk page otherwise) which is different from how the predecesor, StatisticianBot, formatted the links. Previously, the links would go to the GAN page and jump to the section where the nomination is. BlueMoonset makes a good case for the previous format, but I think we'd both like to hear wider input on what others would prefer.

'''TL;DR''': Where should the links on [[Wikipedia:Good article nominations/Report]] point, the GAN page as previously, the article's review page as currently, or some other option?

{{rfcquote|text=
No-one's formally proposed this solution above, but it certainly has received a lot of support. Let's see if there's actual consensus for it. I propose changing the text of [[WP:NOQUORUM]] to the following:

{{blockquote|If a nomination has received no comments from any editor besides the nominator and the article hasn't been declined for proposed deletion in the past, the closing administrator should treat the AfD nomination as an expired PROD. Generally, this will result in soft deletion (see below), but administrators should evaluate the nominating statement as they would a PROD rationale. See [[WP:PROD]] for more details.

If the nomination has received very few comments, has received no comments but appears controversial to the closing administrator, or has been declined for proposed deletion in the past, the discussion may be closed at the closer's discretion and best judgement. Common options include, but are not limited to:

* relisting the discussion (see the section '[[#Relisting discussions|Relisting discussions]]');
* closing as "no consensus" with no prejudice against speedy renomination ('''NPASR'''); and
* closing in favour of the nominator's stated proposal.
* '''Soft deletion''' is a special kind of deletion which may be used after an article's deletion discussion. If a deletion discussion sees very little discussion even after being relisted several times, the administrator can close the discussion as soft delete and delete the page. However, in this case, the article can be restored for any reason on request. If your article was soft-deleted, you can request it be restored at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion|Requests for undeletion]].  The closer should make it clear the deletion is a soft delete as part of the close, ideally with a link to this guideline.
* There is consensus among the community that problematic or likely-problematic articles<ref>Usually articles unreferenced for years.</ref> with an appropriate redirection target may be [[WP:BLAR|blanked and redirected]] by any editor if there are no objections. This similarly applies to deletion nominations as well; if no editor suggests that the corresponding article should be kept, then redirection is an option.}}

{{reftalk}}

Note that most of the text is the same, but I have cut out a "special case" where no comments have been made other than the nominator, in which case the nomination will be treated as an expired PROD. In the spirit of our current PROD process, articles that have had a PROD declined will not be considered as expired PRODs, since PRODs are meant to occur only once per article. ~ [[User:BU Rob13|<b>Rob</b><small><sub>13</sub></small>]]<sup style="margin-left:-1.0ex;">[[User talk:BU Rob13|Talk]]</sup> 01:03, 21 November 2016 (UTC)}}

So I am in the process of cleaning up deprecated parameters from templates. This template has a number of them. During a discussion about these parameters (see above) it came to light that some parameters in the template are all one word (for example {{param|foobar}}) while others have an underscore (such as {{param|foo_bar}}. The question on the table is regarding making all the template parameters consistent. I will gladly be responsible for changing the transclusions (it will be done with a bot), updating the template and the template documentation, etc. I just want to make sure that a consensus is reached! For simplicity sake, the question on the table for '''support''' or '''oppose''' is:
:''Should all multi-word parameters in the template (such as {{param|expansiondraftyear}}) be formatted to use underscores (i.e. {{param|expansion_draft_year}}.''
Obviously all comments comments are welcome! Not just support/oppose. Looking forward to hearing all input! Also if there are additional parameters that are deprecated and should be removed, let's be sure to get that well documented so I can hit them all when I run my bot. --[[User:Zackmann08|<span style="color:DarkTurquoise;">Zackmann08</span>]] (<sup>[[User_talk:Zackmann08|Talk to me]]</sup>/<sub>[[Special:Contributions/Zackmann08|<span style="color:orange;">What I been doing</span>]]</sub>) 06:18, 25 November 2016 (UTC)}}

We have a June 2016 [[Cochrane review]] that states "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27339435 Patients with CFS may generally benefit and feel less fatigued following exercise therapy, and no evidence suggests that exercise therapy may worsen outcomes.]"

;Option 1 (proposed by Doc James)
As this is an important point I propose we add "'''Exercise therapy does not appear to make people worse.'''" to the third paragraph of the lead.

;Option 2 (proposed by Doc James)
Other wording could include "'''There is no evidence of harm from exercise.'''"

We seem to be using terms like "win" and "lose" fast and loose. Can we take a moment to build a consensus as to what it means to "lose" the popular vote so we have an objective standard to measure future edits and avoid edit-warring? Here are a few options: 
#Lose the Popular Vote means to Secure Less than 50% of the Popular Vote
#Lose the Popular Vote means to Secure Fewer Popular Votes than the Person who Received the Most Popular Votes 
#Lose the Popular Vote means to Secure Fewer Popular Votes than Any Other Candidate 
<small>'''If standard #1''' is adopted, Donald Trump would have lost the popular vote in 2016 (along with every other candidate, but this would not materially change the article since he would still be listed as a president who "won" despite "losing").

This article was recently created by me, and shortly thereafter [[User:Bearcat]] disputed the neutrality of this article. Without discussion, an anonymous editor using [http://www.gogoair.com/ airplane Wi-Fi] proceeded to remove a lot of referenced information which he [[WP:IDONTLIKEIT|must not have liked]]. A neutral tone is important, and making the language a little less harsh is understandable, but removing referenced information is [[whitewashing]] and a general disservice to readers of Wikipedia. The overwhelming majority of sources criticize the website. [http://www.snopes.com/fox-news-benghazi-probe-hoax/ Snopes has debunked articles published by Bipartisan Report]. This website is documented in reliable sources as essentially being something ran out of someone's basement, using far-fetched headlines as [[click bait]], and the operator of the website doesn't even contest that. In my opinion, this article is not even worth keeping with only three sentences. The article, as it stands now, barely demonstrates [[WP:N|notability]], and it's debatable if it demonstrates it at all since this website is proof that anyone with an internet connected device can make a site "claiming" to be the world's largest newspaper, just as any 13 year old girl can claim to be the world's best soccer player on her Facebook page. I do believe, however, that the article met the requirements of inclusion prior to the reduction in content, as there were numerous [[WP:RS|sources]] cited.

{{rfcquote|text=
:Background: [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Abortion advocacy movement coverage]] and [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Abortion article titles]] from 2012. Wikipedia has never been quite sure how to refer to the abortion activism movements, and currently the article titles are set from a narrow consensus at [[Abortion-rights movements]] and [[Anti-abortion movements]]. This RFC instead asks the question: how can we refer to the movements in article prose? This question is necessary because the status quo has gradually settled on a certain balance and I contend that that status is entirely out of balance, a clear and present violation of [[WP:NPOV|Wikipedia's core neutrality policy]] and an affront to the supporters of both movements.
*What is the current status quo? Abortion-rights movements are referred to as "[[pro-choice]]" for example [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] and [[Planned Parenthood]] and [[:Category:Pro-choice organizations in the United States]]. The only place "[[pro-life]]" survives is [[:Category:American pro-life activists]], a holdout from the Great Renaming in which cats were mostly moved to "anti-abortion", which is the current status quo term for the so-called [[anti-abortion movements]]. Editors simply will not allow anyone or anything to be called "pro-life", whether or not the topic in question clearly transcends anti-abortion, or a preponderance of [[WP:RS]] describe the topic as "pro-life", which would seem to violate [[WP:V]] and [[WP:OR]].
:Therefore, the logic would suggest that "pro-choice", a biased non-neutral term used only by supporters to describe themselves, should be eliminated in order to level the playing field. It is the only way to comply with [[WP:NPOV]] if we are to avoid accusations of [[WP:SYSTEMIC]] bias which would be indicated by the way that the pro-abortion position is given the largesse to self-identify while pro-life is not. So the questions before us are:
# '''How will we refer to abortion-rights movements in article prose?''' (a) pro-abortion (b) pro-choice (c) abortion rights
# '''How will we refer to anti-abortion movements in article prose?''' (a) anti-abortion (b) pro-life (c) opposition to abortion rights
:I suggest that the outcome of this RFC should become binding project-wide so that we have a clear and consistent method of referring to these topics that will not be the subject of constant contention and edit-wars without any clear resolution.

Hi, Long story short back in December {{noping|Kind Tennis Fan}} had converted the entire article to MDY[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christmas&diff=695844019&oldid=695605220] - There was no consensus for this nor was there any discussion, So having seen Walter Görlitz convert all dates to MDY I then had converted everything to YMD, Since then there's been a disagreement/edit war over this so I wanted to get a wider discussion as to what should be used or done,<br />
I had attempted to revert back to Dec 2015 and readd all of the edits however it would've took forever and was way too much so I had self-reverted and decided to start an RFC, Thanks, –[[User:Davey2010|<span style="color:#147A44;">'''Davey'''</span><span style="color:#C4061C;">'''2010'''</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Davey2010|<span style="color:#147A44;">Merry Xmas</span> / <span style="color:#C4061C;">Happy New Year</span>]]</sup> 23:34, 27 December 2016 (UTC)}}

This request for comments has been created in order to determine what should be done about a user who, late last July, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Augstn&offset=&limit=250&target=Augstn completely revamped] this page for the worse and whom I suspect used a second account by the name of [[User:Bndktfanta]] when doing so. Some may argue that it can be forgiven and forgotten because (s)he was a new editor, but I think that his/her edits show an abundantly clear wish to give the article bias, that they unquestionably constitute [[WP:Vandalism|vandalism]], and that they are too substantial for such brushing off. Because of the changes made since then, his/her edits cannot be [[WP:Rollback|rolled back]]. How do we go about fixing this page and preventing something like this from happening in the future?

I suggest this article could do with a rewrite.  I propose to base this on neutral academic [[WP:SECONDARY]] sources, rather than the [[WP:PRIMARY]] sources it is currently based upon.  This has been opposed with the comment that the article should only be based on [[WP:PRIMARY]] sources, principally political speeches and statements by the parties.  I propose to use:

*Thomas D. Musgrave (2000). Self-Determination and National Minorities. Oxford University Press. p. 239. ISBN 978-0-19-829898-4.
*Simon J. Lincoln (1994). The Legal Status of Gibraltar: Whose Rock is it Anyway? Fordham International Law Journal. Volume 18, Issue 1, Article 8.

This article is more likely to be written in [[American English]] than British due to the country's history as a possession of the the [[United States]]. It, along with other [[Central American]] countries, such as the [[Dominican Republic]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Panama]] were under American hegemony most of the 20th century. Panama and the Dominican Republic were even briefly occupied. A request to include the template [[Template:American English|American English]] be included in the talk pages of the articles.

{{rfcquote|text=
[[Wikipedia:Stand-alone lists|Stand-alone lists]] are defined as ''"articles composed of one or more embedded lists, or series of items formatted into a list."'' The current [[Wikipedia:Good article criteria#What cannot be a good article?|good article criteria]] mentions that stand-alone lists should be nominated directly as [[WP:FL|featured lists]] rather than as good articles. Currently, there are a few lists that have good article status: for example, [[List of counties in Delaware]], [[List of Ops (B) staff]] and more... As lists are technically defined as articles, and as there may be lists that may perhaps qualify to be ''good articles'' before being improved to featured list standards, editors may be motivated to develop good quality lists if lists (in other words, articles by definition) may be allowed to be nominated for GA status. In this context, I request for the comments of my fellow editors to the following queries:

#''"Should stand-alone lists be allowed to be nominated as [[WP:GA|good articles]]?"''
#''"Should a new criteria of Good List status be introduced instead of qualifying lists as Good Articles?"''
#''"Should we continue status quo, that is, not change anything and let it continue as it is?"''
