Trial in the Senate expected to begin in January 2020" to "Impeached by the House of Representatives. ''Trial date in Senate not set''."?

# Mention his self-reported ancestry in the lead as well as in the body.
# Leave out the ancestry in the lead but mention it in the body.
# Don't mention ancestry at all.
And/or
# Don't mention the (as yet unsubstantiated) allegations, coming from two avowedly right-wing sources, at all. Wait and watch for future press or other coverage.
# Mention the allegations, making clear the names of the accusers, in a brief note with the best possible sources, in the body of the text following mention of his self-reported ancestry.

Indian films and television shows often have three credits for writing: Story, screenplay and dialogue. For background, please see [https://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/dialogues-and-screenplay-separated-at-birth-abbas-tyrewala/story-EfS1ol8YDFZ6dTv6XnyqGJ.html this article]. The essence, is that someone might conceive of a story, someone will write the stage direction, and someone will write the dialogue, the latter being a specialised skill that a screenwriter doesn't always perform. This convention is not limited to a handful of series, it is widespread and obviously different from how western television shows are produced.

Currently, when editors add this content, they might lump all three into the {{para|writer}} parameter and format them using pseudoheadings like at [[Naagin (2015 TV series)]]:
:{{ubl|'''Story'''|Mrinal Jha|'''Screenplay'''|R M Joshi|'''Dialogues'''|Deepti Rawal}}

There has been an ongoing discussion about the inclusion of each House race and associated details at [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections]], as well as other articles. Some editors have raised concerns regarding the size of the article, but others have argued that cutting down the information in the article is not justified. Here are some of the options that have been discussed:

* Option A: status quo, essentially. Keep all races and information currently in place in the article.
* Option B: do not list each individual race on this page, instead only having the races listed on state pages (e.g. [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections in Massachusetts]]).
* Option C: Do not list each individual race on this page, but instead have them listed (in essentially their current form) at a separate list article. 
* Option D: List all the races, but cut down on the details listed, shifting the more detailed information to other articles ([[2016 United States House of Representatives elections]] being one potential example)
* Option E: Something else

(NOTE:  This only refers to major performances where the musician is the headline act, not where they just perform a few songs along with many other musicians.)

{{rfcquote|text=
This RfC is about the inclusion of the phrase "local independent record label", releasing Aphex Twin's first record, in the lead. It follows a sentence about the artist starting to perform as a DJ in the area in which they grew up. As most featured/good articles about musicians or bands include in the lead salient summary details of how an artist went from unknown to becoming a notable musician (e.g. [[The_Beatles|1]], [[Nina Simone|2]], [[Elvis Presley|3]]), this aspect of ''how'' the artist achieved that is relevant, but other editor feels it is important not to include it in the lead for space reasons.

In the lead section, per [[WP:MOSLEAD]], part of the aim is to "cultivate interest in reading on", and expanding this section slightly from merely a list of the records and various aliases that the artist has used serves that end. More detail about the launching of the artist's career is given in the body. A [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aphex_Twin&oldid=929840230 version] was arrived at after editing by [[user:Acousmana|Acousmana]], with the word "local" added to give narrative continuity from the preceding sentence [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aphex_Twin&diff=next&oldid=929840230 here], but editor GentleCollapse6 feels it is important that a reference to his widening DJ career, and specifically any reference to the label which began his career and its place in the local techno community, be removed completely. This RfC seeks comments on ways to resolve these conflicting views. <span style="white-space:nowrap;text-shadow:#4682B4 0.1em 0.1em 1.5em,#4682B4 -0.1em -0.1em 1.5em;color:#000000">[[User:Cambial Yellowing|<i style="color:#999900">Cambial Yellowing</i>]][[User talk:Cambial Yellowing|<b style="color:#218000">❧</b>]]</span> 04:20, 9 December 2019 (UTC)}}

It earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor, making him the third-youngest nominee in the category. He portrayed a drug-addicted teenager in the drama ''Beautiful Boy'' (2018), earning a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, King Henry V in the period drama ''The King'' (2019), and collaborated with Greta Gerwig in the coming-of-age films ''Lady Bird'' (2017) and ''Little Women'' (2019).

'''B.''' In 2017, Chalamet gained wider recognition for his portrayal of Elio Perlman in Luca Guadagnino's romantic drama ''Call Me by Your Name'', after which he appeared in the coming-of-age films ''Hot Summer Nights'' and ''Lady Bird'' as well as the western ''Hostiles''. His performance in ''Call Me by Your Name'' earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, making him the third-youngest nominee in the category. He then portrayed a drug-addicted teenager in the drama ''Beautiful Boy'' (2018), for which he was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. In 2019, Chalamet starred as King Henry V and Theodore "Laurie" Laurence in the period dramas ''The King'' and ''Little Women'', respectively.

I have been involved in an edit war with {{Reply to|Doc James}} over the question of whether [[alcoholism]] should be included as a complication of alcohol intoxication. My position is that our own article on Alcoholism provides sufficient language to justify the notion that alcohol intoxication leads to alcoholism: subsection [[Alcoholism#Warning_signs]] states that "warning signs of alcoholism include... frequent intoxication," and subsection [[Alcoholism#Definition]] states that "the drinking will increase as more intoxication is required." The other editor insists that listing alcoholism as a risk factor is sufficient, despite the fact that language published by Wikipedia makes clear that additional alcohol intoxication is just as much of a complication—in other words, my position is that alcohol intoxication is BOTH a risk factor for, AND complication of, alcoholism. I'm saying that we should, at the least, classify it as both. [[User:Rowsdower45|Rowsdower45]] ([[User talk:Rowsdower45|talk]]) 05:12, 10 December 2019 (UTC)}}

Currently, administrators are only technically able to prevent users from editing the entire site via a [[WP:BLOCK|block]]. In 2018 and early 2019, the Wikimedia Foundation's [[Wikipedia:Community health initiative on English Wikipedia|Anti-Harassment Tools team]] worked on implementing '''partial blocks'''. Rather than the entire site, this functionality would allow [[WP:ADMIN|administrators]] to prevent a user from:
# Editing one or more specific page(s)
# Editing all pages within one or more namespace(s)
# Emailing other users
As of December 2019, this functionality [[phab:T218626|has been deployed]] on most large- and medium-size wikis—specifically the Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, and Telugu Wikipedias, as well as on Meta Wiki, MediaWiki, and all Wiktionary, Wikivoyage, and Wikisource wikis. There are plans to deploy the functionality to more projects in the future as well. More information on partial blocks can be read at [[Wikipedia:Community health initiative on English Wikipedia/Partial blocks]]. An example of a partial blocks policy modeled off of other wikis can be found at [[:Meta:Partial block model policy]].

The purpose of this [[WP:RFC|request for comment]] is to determine whether partial blocks should be enabled on the English Wikipedia. 05:45, 12 December 2019 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I was lurking through various ARBCOM cases in 2019, and happened across one that covered this article. I clicked it, interested in the subject, only to find that the article is teeming with NPOV violations. Take the section under "Political views and controversies" called "Birtherism": the entire section is just attacking the subject of the page. I'm not a defender of Fox News or their obvious bias, but this seems completely contrary to Wikipedia's purpose as an aggregate of what reliable sources say to produce an encyclopedia. What's the point of mentioning an AP article that says that he was supposedly a "publicity nightmare"? The only reason this is here is to attack the subject of the article, which is not only a NPOV violation, but is also a BLP violation. Hell, the entire political views and controversies section is just attacks (typically, controversies sections are not something that should take up half of the article). Also, the claim in the lede that he is a "Trump confidante" is not supported by the sources that the claim cites. As a result of all of this, I'm asking for input on '''what we should do to neutrally reword the controversies section, to the best of our ability, as supported by reliable sources'''. I understand that this topic has been discussed ad nauseam on the talk page, but nothing has been done to solve the problem. Do any of the editors of this page have some ideas as to how we could rework the controversies section? Thanks, and happy holidays!

This is a two-part RfC convened as the result of [[Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution_noticeboard#White_Croatia|this discussion at the dispute resolution noticeboard]]. The RfC concerns the addition of claims regarding various source's views on the location of White Croatia. The first issue concerns the addition of claims attributed to 19th century sources, and the second issue concerns the interpretation of the source Živkovic (2012). A third dispute identified at DRN is contingent on the outcome of the Živkovic dispute, and thus there may be a need for a further RfC once this one is closed. <s>'''[EDIT]'''</s> <s><sub>signed, </sub>[[User:Rosguill|'''''Rosguill''''']] <sup>[[User talk:Rosguill|''talk'']]</sup> 04:20, 13 December 2019 (UTC</s>) Resubmitted by [[User:Iryna Harpy|Iryna Harpy]] ([[User talk:Iryna Harpy|talk]]) 06:57, 12 January 2020 (UTC)}}

Should the [[List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches#Booster_landings|booster landings]] graph be simplified? More specifically, is the graph difficult to understand due to having too much detail? A closely related issue is that most editors agree that the captions "Ocean failure", "Parachutes failure", and "Ocean touchdown" should be improved, but we cannot come to a consensus as to how. Simplifying the graph would solve this.

The options for simplification are:

*'''Option 1:''' Do nothing.
*'''Option 2:''' Merge the categories "Ocean failure", "Parachutes failure", and "Ocean touchdown" together into "Test (no recovery)".
*'''Option 3:''' Merge the categories "Ocean failure", "Parachutes failure", "Ocean touchdown", and "No attempt" together into "No attempt".
*'''Option 4:''' Same as option 2, and also merge both kinds of success into "Success" and both kinds of failure into "Failure".

I was the nom of the RM that resulted in moving this article from Chairman to Chairperson ([[Talk:Chairperson/Archive_4]]). I'm also aware that prior to that, an attempt to move this article from '''Chairman''' to '''Chair (person)''' did not succeed [[Talk:Chairperson/Archive_3#Requested_move_22_March_2019]], a decision that was contested and  endorsed in move review ([[Wikipedia:Move_review/Log/2019_May#Archive_4]]).

Despite this history, I still think the issue of this title is not yet quite settled, but before we have a hopefully final RM to get that done, I think we need to find consensus about the answer to the following question:

{{big|'''IF'''}} (that's a big "if") this article were to be moved to '''Chair (''disambiguator'')''', what would be the best disambiguator, ''and why''?

# executive
# officer
# person
# presiding officer
# role
# parliamentary procedure
# title
# officeholder
# position

'''''Note''': Let's please keep the discussion in this section focused on the best disambiguator question. In particular, please refrain from opining about any other title (like '''Chairperson''' or '''Chairman''')  being better or worse than any  '''Chair (disambiguator)''' option - that's for another section, or for a future RM.''

There is an ongoing discussion above about several works included on the main page that recieved popular press attention, but were not submitted to academic review, nor published in any journal.  I think ideally we wouldn't include sources of that nature in this article, which is more technical in focus, and would rely on peer-reviewed academic work, specificially peer-reviewed secondary sources per [[WP:SCHOLARSHIP]]. But at a minimum, we need to include language clarifying that these works recieved no academic review and have recieved some criticism from economists. 

However, another editor has argued that retention for retention of the source, arguing that it meets [[WP:RS]] guidelines, and does not want any hedging language included for fear of not presenting [[WP:NPOV]]. 

I'd like to request comments on whether inclusion of this type of work is warranted here, and what the best language to include might be to clarify its relative standing with other academic works a la [[WP:SCHOLARSHIP]].

 '''For this article, should the introduction include the translated name <del>Caer Ogyrfan</del>{{lang-cy|Croesoswallt }}?'''

There has been a long dispute here raised by some who feel <del>Caer Ogyrfan</del>. "{{lang-cy|Croesoswallt}}" (the Welsh name for Oswestry) should not be used in the introduction. Among registered users I believe there is a consensus for including the Welsh name, however the arguments go back to 2010 and the matter has not been settled formally.

[[Template:More citations needed]] and [[Template:Citations needed]] have had automatic, [[Template:DATE|substituted dates]] for years. You just insert the template and that's it, no need to add or paste anything manually. It looks like this:

{{Quote|text='''Month and year'''<br><nowiki>{{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}}</nowiki><br><nowiki>{{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}</nowiki>|sign=|source=}}

But all (or most) other [[cleanup templates]], like [[Template:Tone]], [[Template:POV]], [[Template:Cleanup reorganize]], etc. seem to lack this feature for some unexplained reason (or just due to lack of attention to the issue). I'm aware that some bot is supposed to go around and do this job (of adding missing dates), but I've seen numerous cleanup templates without dates, and there seems to be no good reason why [[Template:More citations needed]] and [[Template:Citations needed]] have this feature but other cleanup templates don't. I've looked at the template date source codes, but they seemed to be the same. If those templates can have that feature, why not lift that reliance on the bot for all the templates?

Should automatic date substitutions be added to all cleanup templates? [[User:SUM1|SUM1]] ([[User talk:SUM1|talk]]) 18:48, 29 December 2019 (UTC)}}

{{ping|Geographyinitiative}}
The question is whether the [[Traditional Chinese]] or [[Simplified Chinese]] forms of [[Standard Mandarin]] count as the same name or as different names in regards to names of places or people. This determines whether both forms should be displayed in the [[Template:Chinese]] infobox, or whether only one or the other should. For example, would a simplified Chinese form of a name of a person in the Republic of China like leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] be considered a "foreign language name" and therefore excluded from the template ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chiang_Kai-shek&diff=916941725&oldid=916332404&diffmode=source see reasoning in this edit])?

(for people unfamiliar with Chinese history, the [[Republic of China]] controlled the Mainland until 1949, then moved to Taiwan, while Simplified Chinese was introduced in Mainland China by the [[People's Republic of China]] after that; Chiang never changed his allegiance from the ROC and remained on Taiwan)

This may affect multiple articles, including historical Chinese figures who lived before the advent of simplified Chinese characters so I believe it is necessary to do the RFC here.

For further info see:
* [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/China_and_Chinese-related_articles#Should_the_Chinese_infobox_display_both_Simplified_and_Traditional_Chinese_for_all_Greater_China_and/or_Sinosphere-related_subjects,_or_should_it_only_display_the_relevant_ones_per_territory/area?]] (previous discussion on whether articles related to Chinese should have both Traditional or Simplified forms)

The [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2020-01-27/From the editor|January 27 ''Signpost'' "From the editor" column]] describes the several years-long and ongoing paid advocacy abuse by [[Status Labs]] (formerly Wiki-PR), including their community ban from the English Wikipedia, their global ban imposed by the Foundation, a [https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/11/19/wikimedia-foundation-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-wikipr/ cease-and-desist letter sent in 2013], and [https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-1-scrubs-its-image-online-11576233000 six recent and ongoing paid advocacy abuses reported by the ''Wall Street Journal'' last month]. Foundation officials told the ''Signpost'' that they would only take further action if the English Wikipedia community requests such "through its usual governing processes." Accordingly, this RFC asks the Wikimedia Foundation to enforce the Terms of Use against Status Labs violations, such as by reporting infringement of the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]], seeking civil penalties for those violations, and any other actions which the Foundation's attorneys believe will most likely halt the ongoing abuses. 07:30, 27 January 2020 (UTC)}}

For the purpose of gaining WikiProject consensus, I'm starting a discussion regarding a proposal about whatever or not we should have templates for NHL teams that won the [[Stanley Cup]] with the list of players and coaches who won the championship in their respective seasons. We got templates for Super Bowl winning NFL teams, NBA teams who won the NBA Finals and MLB teams who won the World Series. Plus, we got a template for the hockey players who won the [[Triple Gold Club]]. For those reasons, it is possible to have templates for NHL teams who won the Stanley Cup. 

'''Discussion'''

The discussion of this proposal are about putting in navbox templates for NHL teams who won the Stanley Cup in their respective seasons, like the ones we have in teams who won the Super Bowl, NBA Finals and the World Series. Option 1 is '''Support''' for inclusion of the templates. Option 2 is '''Oppose''' of not having them. '''Neutral''' is for those who are indecisive. Please state your comments about the proposal of having navigation boxes of NHL teams who won the Stanley Cup in their Stanley Cup winning seasons.

Does a restaurant having a [[Michelin star]] rating, especially if its the only source, make the restaurant notable? I know the notability guidelines say top 100 and similar lists are not reliable sources, but I'm not sure if Michelin ratings would fit into that or not. The star rating system doesn't seem to give a detailed review of the restaurant receiving the rating. So I think that should disqualify it automatically, but even if there was details I don't think it would be a reliable source on its own or even with other better sources backing it up. I ask because I requested an article for the restaurant [['t Brouwerskolkje]] be deleted due to lack of notability, but two people said the restaurant having a Michelin star rating was enough to keep the article. Although, the article lacks any other reliable sources. Let alone broad coverage. --[[User:Adamant1|Adamant1]] ([[User talk:Adamant1|talk]]) 04:44, 23 January 2020 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
When the previous [[#RFC on Science of Identity Foundation|RFC]] on whether there should be mention of the [[Science of Identity Foundation|SIF]] in Gabbard's BLP was closed, the closer stated there was a majority in favor of 'yes' but noted: "A few editors objected to the phrasing of the RfC statement, because it does not specify the exact wording that would be used in the article." The closer left the [[Talk:Tulsi Gabbard#Proposed wordings|Proposed wordings]] section open for workshopping of text. That section was not used but some proposed wording was put under a new section that been created for another purpose. To open the matter to broad participation and centralize discussion, this RfC is for workshopping text pertaining to SIF and Gabbard appropriate for her BLP.

To my thinking, ''Diagnosis'' is intimately linked with ''Signs/symptoms/Characteristics/Presentation'' and should follow it (hence proposal is to move it up two slots to follow that section. I have come to this way of thinking when writing leads that the information flows more naturally that way. This also allows for (possibly) less duplication as similar material is adjacent in the article. I can't see that there was much discussion about the original order.

{{rfcquote|text=
[[:Tulsa race riot]] → {{no redirect|Tulsa race massacre}} – It's now been six months since the full move request discussion from August 8 2019, and many reliable sources are now referring to the event as a Massacre rather than as a Riot.
For example, when searching "site:nytimes.com tulsa race", we can see the latest article the Times has published refers to the event as a massacre: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/us/tulsa-race-massacre-mass-grave.html (titled "Nearly 100 Years After Tulsa Massacre, City Plans to Search Cemetery for Victims"). Similarly, "site:washingtonpost.com tulsa race" gives us https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/02/03/tulsa-mass-graves-excavation/ (titled "Tulsa plans to dig for suspected mass graves from a 1921 race massacre"), and "site:npr.org tulsa race" gives us https://www.npr.org/2019/12/17/789015343/new-research-identifies-possible-mass-graves-from1921-tulsa-race-massacre (titled "New Research Identifies Possible Mass Graves From 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre"). NPR also has a transcript of an All Things Considered piece from the same day at https://www.npr.org/2019/12/17/789036767/new-discoveries-open-old-chapter-in-tulsa-race-riots-of-1921 which is titled "New Discoveries Open Old Chapter In Tulsa Race Riots Of 1921," but the transcript of the story itself consistently refers to the event as a Massacre, and does not say Riot.
As these three organizations represent sources of record, I believe that we now have enough support from sources to make this move, and as the waiting period [[User:El_C|El_C]] requested has now ended, this seems like an excellent time to re-open the discussion.

Here is the website: https://www.guancha.cn/ It is a Chinese source, and I raised the discussion because I noticed is has been used in topics such as [[Zhang Weiwei]], [[Arab Winter]] (Chinese professor Zhang Weiwei first..) and [[2019–20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak]]. The discussion is not about Fengwen part of the website since it is user-generated, the discussion is about the news and comment part of the website. I believed the website is a questionable source at least in politic since it may be highly promotional of Chinese nationalism. If we needs to cite official statement, government websites and state-run media are more realiable. If we needs to cite nationalism content, Global Times may be more realiable. And how should we treat contents in guancha.cn that are or are not much related to politics?

{{rfcquote|text=
[Continued from "Executive producers" section above]

The current practice for most album articles is to include all the producers credited in the album liner notes or other reliable sources. The template guidance indicates: "Enter the name of the person(s) credited with the '''[[record producer|record production]]'''. This is someone who oversees the recording process and is usually different from the artist or songwriter. For multiple entries, see Notes[instructions for using class=hlist] for details." While historically albums list one to three producers, it has become more common for albums to have different producers for each song or producers who play a limited role. Sometimes this results in a long entry of 20–30 names in the album infobox producer(s)= field. Additionally, the list may include persons who only produced one or two tracks (not the album) or whose role doesn't involve actual music production (such as in some executive capacity). 

To best represent the article, should the infobox list of producers be limited in some way? Please indicate '''Limit''', '''Unlimited''', or '''Comment''' and an explanation. —[[User:Ojorojo|Ojorojo]] ([[User talk:Ojorojo|talk]]) 15:51, 15 January 2020 (UTC)}}

Is it appropriate for one party to a two-party disagreement to give themselves the last word and unilaterally close the discussion (re. "James Bond spoofs")?

All downloads are digital by nature, therefore the word "digital" doesn't need to be included when downloads are mentioned in an article or infobox. It's as simple as that. Using it would be as ridiculous as using "digital streaming" instead of simply "streaming" in the infobox. I've been told that this is the "widely accepted" way of noting a download format in the infobox, which in turn means that we're promoting redundancies, which I ''thought'' was something we try to avoid when editing Wikipedia. Pinging {{ping|Gagaluv1}} and {{ping|MarioSoulTruthFan}} as I have been involved in edit exchanges with them both over this issue. I think it's time for a change here.

* The arguments for exclusion are violation of [[WP:BLP]] (because the material is disputed), [[WP:NOT]] (an indiscriminate collection of information), [[WP:FANCRUFT]] (only relevant to fans) and [[WP:POV]] (I'm unable to find the rationale for this last). [[WP:BLPREQUESTRESTORE]] has been cited as rationale for exclusion, absent consensus on the suitability of the material.
* The arguments for inclusion are that it it does not violate [[WP:BLP]], is not excessive to the point of triggering [[WP:NOT]] for the BLP of an actively engaged and followed media personality, is not [[WP:FANCRUFT]] (for the same reason), and [[WP:BLPREQUESTRESTORE]] is a guideline for admins, not editors so isn't a trigger until admin intervention.

I have requested this article be split into two separate articles. One regarding the Anti-NATO group of deputies in the second Russian State Duma, and the other about general opposition to NATO globally, as one is a group specific to one country, the other is a global school of thought/ideology.

Most of the first paragraph could be put into the article about the Russian State Duma, the rest is relevant to general opposition to NATO. We probably need more information on the State Duma group, as I’m not sure whether or not it meets notability criteria for a Wikipedia article.

 I propose that we begin to number Prime Ministers by tenure, and not by person, hence Boris Johnson would be the 77th PM (and not the 55th); for more information on the differences, please view [[List of prime ministers of the United Kingdom by tenure start]].

I propose this with the following reasons:

:1) It is widely accepted that Robert Walpole is the first PM - he is listed as such on the UK Governments official website<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers}}</ref> and on our own Wikipedia page for the UK Prime Minister. 

:2) It is also widely accepted that BJ is the 77th Prime Minister - again, this is backed up by the official UK Government website and our own Wikipedia pages. 

:3) A quick Google search reveals that multiple mainstream media reports Boris Johnson as the 77th PM, and Theresa May the 76th, David Cameron the 75th, and so on - further reinforcing the numbering system as accurate and widely accepted, and the fact that people do refer to PM's by their tenure number.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/boris-johnson-set-assume-office-britain-s-77th-prime-minister-n1033281}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://theweek.com/speedreads/635741/theresa-may-becomes-britains-76th-prime-minister}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/07/13/brexit-overshadow-david-camerons-legacy/87020394/}}</ref>

:4) Numbering is not exclusive to the USA, as previously suggested - looking at other countries, such as Singapore, New Zealand, and Australia, they all number their PMs. 

:5) Numbering leaders would give much more clarity as to the chronological order of the Prime Ministers tenure when viewing their respective pages, without having to consult the full list.

I feel that we should probably change the name of the article from '''List of music considered the worst''' to '''List of music notable for negative reception'''.

'''What should be the venue for discussing rcat ([[WP:Redirect categorization]]) templates/categories?'''

This question is prompted by [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2020 January 20#Template:R from meme]] where this question was raised. I personally think it should be at RfD since the audience at RfD will likely be more experienced with redirect categories making them better at making decisions about them then the audiences at TfD or CfD. While this is quite different from RfDs regular content I still believe that they are the most suitable for handling these template with RfDers generally having experience using them. Both TfD and CfD have a reasonable claim since they are templates and they are used for categorizing pages. I will transclude this section at [[WT:RFD]], [[WT:TFD]] and [[WT:CFD]] so all interested parties can participate. ‑‑[[User:Trialpears|Trialpears]] ([[User talk:Trialpears|talk]]) 22:12, 24 January 2020 (UTC)}}

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
There is currently no explicit naming convention for government/cabinet articles. This has led to a lot of inconsistency and inevitably disputes. There are three main inconsistencies - capitalisation, numbering format and syntax.
* Capitalisation - Some editors have taken the view that governments/cabinets aren't [[proper name]]s and have not capitalised (other than where required by [[WP:NCCAPS]]) ([[Fourth Merkel cabinet]], [[Second Johnson ministry]], [[Second Philippe government]]). Others have taken the view that they are proper names and capitalised the full title ([[Second Morrison Ministry]], [[Conte II Cabinet]], [[13th Government of Slovenia]]).
* Numbering format - Variations include full ordinal number ([[Second Modi ministry]]), abbreviated ordinal number ([[29th Canadian Ministry]]) or Roman numbering ([[Sánchez II Government]]).
* Syntax - There are several combinations including
** ''[Ordinal number] [Head of government] [government/cabinet/ministry]'' ([[Fourth Merkel cabinet]]);
** ''[Ordinal number] [government/cabinet/ministry] of [Head of government]'' ([[Second cabinet of Geir Haarde]]); and
** ''[Head of government] [ordinal number] [government/cabinet/ministry]'' ([[Michel II Government]]).
We really need an explicit naming convention to avoid such inconsistency.--[[Special:Contributions/Obi2canibe|Obi2canibe]] ([[User talk:Obi2canibe|talk)]] 17:57, 26 January 2020 (UTC)}}

I’m not sure what the controversy is, but this article was expanded by pulling in several sources, yet an IP address keeps deleting it by claiming that there’s been an insertion of word salad/unsourced information/POV. I’ve asked for clarification but they just revert revert revert. I thought this information about an 800 year old dynasty was pretty dry, so I’m not sure what else to do but to ask for a third party to chime in. Maybe something in it *is* controversial? It’s all sourced, and I just don’t see how an 800 year old dynasty is so provoking.

{{rfcquote|text=
'''Question''': What should the general rule/principle/guideline be for categorizing ''current'' localities by ''historical'' administrative subdivision <u>in Central and Eastern Europe</u>? There are quite a few articles of cities and towns that have been categorized not only in which administrative subdivision they currently are in, but also by the former subdivisions. 

'''Typical example''': [[Eišiškės]], a small town in Lithuania, is in these categories: [[:Category:Cities in Lithuania]], [[:Category:Cities in Vilnius County]], [[:Category:Šalčininkai District Municipality]], [[:Category:Vilnius Voivodeship]], [[:Category:Lidsky Uyezd]], [[:Category:Nowogródek Voivodeship (1919–1939)]]. The first 3 categories reflect the current administrative subdivision. [[Vilnius Voivodeship]] was a subdivision in 1413–1795. [[Lidsky Uyezd]] was a 2nd-level subdivision sometime between 1795–1915. [[Nowogródek Voivodeship (1919–1939)]] was an inter-war subdivision.

'''General options''':
*'''A''': categorization should be limited - by what? Whether it is referenced in the article? How long the subdivision lasted? How large the subdivision was? To the 1st-level former subdivision? To how recent subdivision was? Etc?
*'''B''': categorization should not be allowed (i.e. current localities should be removed from the former subdivision categories; historical information could be preserved in a different venue like a separate list or an addition to the locality article or something similar to the "historical affiliation" box as in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=G%C3%B6rlitz&oldid=939805164#History Görlitz#History]) 
*'''C''': ''status quo''; no general rules; specific issues with individual categories should be addressed at [[WP:CfD]]

[[Template:FAC-instructions|FAC instructions]] currently include these sentences, numbered below for reference:

# An editor is allowed to be the sole nominator of only one article at a time, but two nominations may be allowed if the editor is a co-nominator on at least one of them.
# If a nomination is archived, the nominator(s) should take adequate time to work on resolving issues before re-nominating.
# None of the nominators may nominate or co-nominate any article for two weeks unless given leave to do so by a coordinator; if such an article is nominated without asking for leave, a coordinator will decide whether to remove it.
# A coordinator may exempt from this restriction an archived nomination that attracted no (or minimal) feedback.

This RfC proposes three things:

* '''A''': Change sentence 1 to "An editor is allowed to be the sole nominator of only two articles at a time, but three nominations are allowed if the editor is a co-nominator on at least one of them".
* '''B''': Add the following after sentence 1: "At their discretion, the Featured article review coordinators may grant a fourth nomination or co-nomination to editors who actively engage in improving Featured articles in that process".
* '''C''': Modify sentences 3 & 4.  (Note that sentence 3 refers to the nominator(s) of an archived article, per sentence 2.) How to modify them is open for discussion: suggested options are to leave them unchanged; to remove the restriction; or to suggest a different restriction or different wording.

Should the following changes [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ian_Smith&diff=938946036&oldid=938945766 Changes] be included in the introduction ?
: As part of an attempt to remedy an unfortunate pro-smith bias in the article which I have elaborated in previous talk-page discussion, I made some changes to the introduction to correct this imbalance. The introduction is emblematic of the way the article is subtly biased with meaningless cruft from an obituary put into prominence " a man of integrity and vision who understood the uncomfortable truths of Africa,{{sfn|BBC|2007}}{{vague|date=December 2019}} while critics describe" which don't mean anything without context regarding what exactly those uncomfortable truths are. Furthermore, the use of the term predominantly implies some level of non-white representation in Rhodesias Goverment but during the UDI there was not a single non-white minister in the government. The figure of only 500 black electors is from the Book State of Africa which is extensively used throughout the article.

Should "soccer" or "football" be used in articles related to the sport in South African? Or should the unambiguous term "association football" be used? Ideally, Wikipedia should use consistent wording in South African association football articles per [[MOS:TIES]]. Currently, the wording used is inconsistent across Wikipedia articles, including titles. For example, the national team article is located at [[South Africa national football team]], but the article on the sport in the country is located at [[Soccer in South Africa]]. This inconsistency is also reflected in category/template naming. I have included a list below of all the pages related to South Africa which use "soccer" and "football" in the title. [[User:S.A.

{{rfcquote|text=
 [[User:Owennson]] has been adding sections to articles on MTR stations listing, in detail, the vandalism inflicted by [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests|pro-democratic protesters]] at each station, along with images or image galleries showing this vandalism (Examples: [[Wong Tai Sin station]], [[Mong Kok East station]], [[Fanling station]]). So far he/she has systematically added such sections for all stations on the East Rail and Kwun Tong lines, and is now on the Tsuen Wan line, suggesting an intention to add vandalism subsections to ALL MTR station articles.

I have two concerns, related to [[WP:NPOV]] and [[WP:UNDUE]] respectively. Judging by the content of the user's talk page (a passage critical of the U.S. advocating democracy and human rights), I am concerned that the additions to the MTR pages are simply being made to push a political point, e.g. to make pro-democratic protesters look bad. [[WP:NOT|Wikipedia is not a vehicle for political advocacy]]. Secondly, the level of detail provided is beyond excessive. Nearly ALL MTR stations have been subject to vandalism during the protests. We don't need a dedicated subsection for every single MTR station page. The number of images added to illustrate vandalised ticket machines and other fixtures is excessive and needlessly stretches out the pages.

Owennson's counter-argument (on my talk page) is, in essence, that because the [[2019 Yuen Long attack]] and [[2019 Prince Edward station attack]] (e.g. attacks against people carried out by pro-government forces) are covered on Wikipedia, that it would be a double standard not to cover vandalism by pro-democratic protesters. I don't object to mentioning the vandalism within the articles where the vandalism is more serious. But the level of detail currently being given is seriously [[WP:UNDUE]], and I object to these additions being made seemingly just for political purposes.

As a follow-up to topic-specific discussions at [[Talk:Hassium]] and [[User talk:DePiep#MOS and NBSP]], it seems that the current MOS guideline on the usage of non-breaking spaces when separating numbers from written-out units (e.g. 5 kilometers (instead of 5 km); 118 elements) is open to interpretation. It advises to use non-breaking spaces when line breaks are awkward, which they seem to be in this case; however, implementing this would apparently require making heavy changes to lots of articles, as it is not strongly established as are the examples given in the MOS section.

I thus ask, should the same guideline for quantities and abbreviated units be followed for fully spelled-out units? Should non-breaking spaces be used only with abbreviations, or always with units and quantities? I would like to establish a more definite MOS guideline, in which one or the other is widely agreed upon as common practice.

My argument is that each director's films are properly subdivided according to format or medium, which is standard for Wikipedia. In contrast, [[User:Picsovina]] argues that Kenneth Branagh is well known for Shakespeare adaptations so therefore his Shakespeare adaptations as well as his Agatha Christie adaptations (which have nothing to do with Shakespeare so I don't understand how Picsovia's argument about Branagh being famous for Shakespeare adaptations justifies subdividing Agatha Christie adaptations into a separate group as well) should both be subdivided into separate sections in [[:Template:Kenneth Branagh]], leading to an unwieldy and highly confusing structure according to each film's subject matter rather than format. Other directors famous for directing Shakespeare adaptations include [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Orson Welles]] yet their director templates do not subdivide their Shakespeare adaptations into separate sections. [[John G. Avildsen]] is famous for directing the ''Karate Kid'' movies yet his director template is not divided between ''Karate Kid'' films and ''Other'' films. [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] is famous for directing the ''Mad Max'' films yet his director template is not divided between ''Mad Max'' films and ''Other'' films. [[Guy Hamilton]] is famous for directing four ''James Bond'' films yet his director template is not divided between ''James Bond'' films and ''Other'' films. There is therefore no real standard established precedent for doing so. Each director's films are properly subdivided according to format or medium, which is standard for Wikipedia.

User [[Talleyrand20]], seems determined to exclude the following quote by Russian historian [[Boris Vadimovich Sokolov]] from the article and has deleted it multiple times. The same quote has also been deleted multiple times by IP address [[178.155.64.26]].
 
<blockquote>On the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: that without these Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not have been able to win the Great Patriotic War, it would not have been able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins [FDR's emissary to Moscow in July 1941] that the U.S.S.R. could not match Germany's might as an occupier of Europe and its resources.</blockquote>

Which is sourced to "Weeks 2004, p. 9"

The quote appears to me to be referenced and NPOV as it is assigned to its author. 

[[Talleyrand20]] however appears to believe it is "biased". 

The IP address user who has deleted the quote claimed it is "dull", which does not seem like a valid reason to not include the information.

Should the further reading section contain references about the Black Belt?

Background:

At<br>
[[Talk:Black Belt (geological formation)#Content Seems to Conflict with Sources]]<br>
and<br>
[[Talk:Black Belt (geological formation)#Obsolete term?]]<br>
there was a consensus that the term "black belt" is not in common usage the way phrases like "sun belt" and "rust belt" are used and is not a commonly-used phase today outside of [[physical geography]].<br>
The page was renamed from [[Black Belt (U.S. region)]] to [[Black Belt (geological formation)]] without objection.

{{userlinks|Rjensen}} then created [[Black Belt in the American South]] which, while not a phrase that is in common use the way "bible belt" is, is clearly used by enough sources to justify a Wikipedia article. 

Rjensen then inserted content into [[Deep South]] referring to the page he created[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deep_South&type=revision&diff=940738184&oldid=939961440] and inserted multiple references to the black belt into the further reading section of [[Deep South]] article.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deep_South&type=revision&diff=941057289&oldid=940953906][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deep_South&type=revision&diff=941740448&oldid=941695442] 

The question before us is whether material about the black belt but not about the deep south should be retained to the further reading section of the deep south article. --[[User:Guy Macon|Guy Macon]] ([[User talk:Guy Macon|talk]]) 15:46, 20 February 2020 (UTC)}}

I have understood that - de facto - the figures presented for Netherlands are an aggregate for the '''Kingdom''' of the Netherlands, consisting of the a) '''country''' of the Netherlands, b) Aruba, c) Curaçao, and d) Sint Maarten. Since, however, the sole name ''Netherlands'' is ambiguous, I plead for at least adding - and keeping added - as a note that ''Netherlands'' as mentioned in the table is to be understood the whole kingdom consisting of the four countries each with their own responsible authority. I think this is essential for a good understanding of the nature of the figures. This is a matter of both geography (one country lies in Europe, one in the southeastern Caribbean, two in the northeastern Caribbean) and politics (since it concerns the political division of one kingdom into four countries). Notes to this end have been added and removed several times. Why and by whom they have been removed, I cannot seem to retrace in the edit history, either because the rate of edits is rather high or because no comment was added from which I succeeded to understand that it concerned a change with respect to Netherlands.

{{rfcquote|text=
"Unless the cause of death is itself a reason for notability, a single sentence describing the death is usually sufficient, and often none is included in the lead at all, just a death date."

Is this guideline clear enough to be useful to a user trying to determine whether somebody's cause of death should be included in the lead of their bio?
What I see as a lack of clarity - especially with wording like ''often none is included'' - can lead to long animated discussions such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Caroline_Flack#Death_does_not_go_in_lead_in_this_case this recent one]. Those discussions wouldn't be such a waste of time and effort if briefer, or if altogether unnecessary, given we had a clearer guideline.

Being rather a strong anti-sensationalist myself, hoping always that Wikipedia articles about people will not develop into tabloid-type material, perhaps I have misunderstood the guideline along those lines. If ''normal'' (statisticlly) suicides, car crashes, drug overdoses, for example are to be considered by Wikipedia as defining factors in what's notable about those people, then I am wrong in removing them from leads, whereas with a clearly notable death such as that of [[Christine Chubbuck]] I would not do that. If a celebrity's cause of death is widely reported in media, and that alone makes the cause of death in itself a reason for notability, then I am also wrong in feeling it should be removed from the lead as non-notable. 

I am inviting other editors to chime in here, and to help write a clearer guideline in this detail. --[[User:SergeWoodzing|SergeWoodzing]] ([[User talk:SergeWoodzing|talk]]) 11:14, 22 February 2020 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Currently, the [[Christopher Columbus]] page completely eschews the use of the word "discovery". This has gone back and forth over the years, I think it's time to get a wider commentary on this. The cited references pretty much all use the word, and indeed, several of them have the word in the title of the work. Refusing to use the word seems to be a mixture of [[WP:RECENTISM]] (the fashion for excising "discovery" is fairly recent) and [[WP:CENSOR]] ("discovery" as a dirty word). Either way, it means we're going out of our way to not follow our cited sources.

I understand the changes in current fashion, but I think Wikipedia is ill-served by bending to them. It is beyond question that when Columbus made his initial voyages, they were discoveries that hit both sides of the Atlantic like a thunderbolt. We can quibble over the terminology (perhaps say "discovery of the route" or "discovery from the point of view of both Americans and Eurasians"), but only with caution. It would be easy to get so tied up in precision as to make the article unreadable.

Should we host indicators of prominent awards in articles about other awards, in cases where the two awards are not mentioned by a reliable source listing both? For instance, indicating Academy Awards in other film awards articles, or indicating Emmy Awards in other television awards articles, or indicating Tony Awards in other theatre awards articles. Of course, the two awards would always be supported by two separate groups of sources – the combining of the two awards is the question here.

Hey everyone, I would like to propose that we swap the lede image for either of these two that are already in the article body. I understand there has been dispute regarding the current photo in the past, but there were no free/fair use replacements back then.

However, both of these other pictures are in public domain, and Photo 2 is in Commons. Honestly they just seem to better illustrate the article. Most people don't associate the Kubrick persona with his younger self. Those two other pictures are of Kubrick in his prime, so they might be good candidates. Opinions?

This is an Rfc exclusively regarding the infobox template for the [[2020 Democratic presidential primaries]]. Previously, there was an Rfc about state pages, and this does not affect that result.<br>

The question is:<br>
'''Should withdrawn candidates that have delegates (Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Bloomberg) and candidates still in but with no possible path to victory (Gabbard) still be included in the infobox?'''

The options are:<br>
'''A - Remove all withdrawn candidates and candidates with no possible path.'''<br>
'''B - Remove withdrawn candidates but keep all candidates still in the race. Possibly with a 5% threshold?'''<br>
'''C - Keep as is.'''<br>

Several years ago one editor pursued an agenda of attacking the film using original research and was opposed. The editor then found individual sources for individual points but continued to allow their personal POV to stand in the form of a separate section which enumerated the rules of the film, which the sources cited did not do. They appear to be fixated on this. I have made an attempt to balance the section by not treating the topic of plot holes any differently from other topics praised or decried by different critics of the film, as we normally do in film articles. There is no need for a separate section on a single topic like this. It is UNDUE and POV and SYNTH to do that and to enumerate a list of rules when these are and should be referred to ONCE in the plot itself. This is not a fan site where the film can be nitpicked to death by one person. This is an encylopedia article where we report what was said and no more in the appropriate places. The rules may be described in the plot but they do not need to be rehashed by the editor in reception under a separate banner. Finally, the language used by the editor in reporting / quoting the sources is undue, making it sound like these are not reviewer's opinions but stated facts. 

This RfC asks one question: is the reception section fine as it is, or should it be reworked in some manner based on the above? For those interested in what it could look like should these suggestions be followed, I redid it once myself and it was reverted this morning. I reverted back but probably should have made this comment and RfC first. It has since been reverted again, and I was "ordered" not to revert again on my talk page, unsigned.

Should we add the following section to the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Boxing/MOSGuidelines|WikiProject Boxing Manual of Style]]?

'''Lineal champions'''<br>
There is no single canonical list of lineal champions. Don't include the lineal championship in lists of champions, record tables or succession boxes.

Lineal championships are a point of view and should follow the [[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]] policy:
* Avoid stating it as a fact. A lineal championship is an opinion and should not be stated in Wikipedia's voice.

 Back and forth on this discussion removing sources. Editing contradiction of position SummerPhD on content first needing more sourcing and then eliminating sources as not needed or overdone. Disturbing is the the negative statement that SummerPhD makes "  I'm going to be pecking away at this off and on." further stated "The vast majority of this article is unsourced. Clearly, we need more independent reliable sources." My position clearly is that sources of the time period support the context and content that it just not folklore, or marketing puff but is rooted in Philadelphia culture by the amount of "news" attention exploring the Pretzel Company and the Family that lends to fact telling and inference of phenom of Soft Pretzel in Philadelphia as a food, that is more than a food but taking on an iconic cuisine status among the population.

Hello, there is currently debate about the proper use of self-published sources.
#Editors in most areas of the Wikipedia seem to use self-published sources ([[WP:SPS]]) according to the verifiability policy set forth there: in a nutshell, that SPS can be used with caution as long as they meet certain criteria, and secondary, indepdent sources should typically be preferred as the basis for a good article. Any business org article can be seen to use SPS in this fashion, such as [[Boeing]], [[Google]], and [[Apple Inc.]] There has been little to no resistance or protest against using SPS for all manner of statistics and information, as long as reliable secondary indepdent sources are preferred for analysis and support.
#Editors editing in the anti-abortion topic area have adopted a novel interpretation: SPS are never to be used because their information is considered promotional. For example, an organization publishing its membership numbers or revenue cannot be used as a source, because the organizations always inflate those numbers falsely, making the SPS a decidedly unreliable source. In particular, view #2 has been adopted by {{user|Avatar317}}, on the article [[Knights of Columbus]] and related articles.
RFC question: So which view is correct? Should the [[WP:SPS]] policy be interpreted so strictly that we practically never use SPS? If #2 is true, then what are the actual acceptable criteria? What is the action plan for implementing the reinterpretation across vast swaths of topic areas that apparently have had it wrong all this time?

{{rfcquote|text=
[[Template:FAC-instructions|FAC instructions]] currently include these sentences, numbered below for reference:

# An editor is allowed to be the sole nominator of only one article at a time, but two nominations may be allowed if the editor is a co-nominator on at least one of them.
# If a nomination is archived, the nominator(s) should take adequate time to work on resolving issues before re-nominating.
# None of the nominators may nominate or co-nominate any article for two weeks unless given leave to do so by a coordinator; if such an article is nominated without asking for leave, a coordinator will decide whether to remove it.
# A coordinator may exempt from this restriction an archived nomination that attracted no (or minimal) feedback.

This RfC proposes three things:

* '''A''': Change sentence 1 to "An editor is allowed to be the sole nominator of only two articles at a time, but three nominations are allowed if the editor is a co-nominator on at least one of them".
* '''B''': Add the following after sentence 1: "At their discretion, the Featured article review coordinators may grant a fourth nomination or co-nomination to editors who actively engage in improving Featured articles in that process".
* '''C''': Modify sentences 3 & 4.  (Note that sentence 3 refers to the nominator(s) of an archived article, per sentence 2.) How to modify them is open for discussion: suggested options are to leave them unchanged; to remove the restriction; or to suggest a different restriction or different wording.

It was funny when 'General Tomfoolery' got changed to 'General Jerryfoolery'. But when users are edit warring over section titles as happened in the past four years, moving the page randomly to other titles, as happened in 2017, unnecessarily duplicating the page as happened in 2020, blanking entire sections as happened in 2019 and 2020, messing with the text font, orientation, or size, or the css as happened in 2018, 2019, and 2020, linking to random external links, and performing other such examples of vandalism on the yearly April Fools documentation page, it becomes too excessive and out of hand, and the Wikipedia administrators should crack down upon these violations of Wikipedia policy.

{{rfcquote|text=
The sentence about xenophobia and racism related to the pandemic keeps getting edited back and forth by me and other users, so I believe it's appropriate to create an RfC about it. The current formatting of the sentence is "Misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus have spread online as well as xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people of Asian descent, and others from hotspots.", added by me.

Three versions of the sentence have been included lately:
#...as well as xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and people of Asian descent. (Sentence mentioning discrimination against people of Asian descent only.)
#...as well as xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people of Asian descent, and others from hotspots. (Sentence mentioning discrimination against people from other hotspots, but highlighting Asians.)
#...while xenophobia and discrimination against various ethnic groups has increased internationally. (More ambiguous formatting not mentioning specific groups.)
So I am asking, which the three versions is the most appropriate and neutral. It's also worth asking, if the word "Asians" should specify "East Asians", considering Asian is quite a wide term, at least in most usages. --[[User:Tiiliskivi|Tiiliskivi]] ([[User talk:Tiiliskivi|talk]]) 11:18, 2 April 2020 (UTC)}}

While [[Special:Diff/944385399|this particular edit]] wasn't terribly constructive on its own, it does bring up a good point that I hadn't considered before I reverted it: is 'zookeeper' an accurate disambiguator for this person? He owns and operates a wildlife sanctuary, which is not a [[zoo]], so I'm inclined to believe it isn't. If others agree this is not a good word choice, what word/words are better suited for this? Perhaps [[Kevin Richardson (sanctuary owner)]] or [[Kevin Richardson (conservationist)]], but I'm not completely sold on either one. (Between the two I'd lean towards 'sanctuary owner'.) I've made this an RFC as I suspect this will not be seen otherwise.

Often, editors bundle multiple changes into a single edit, such as adding a new section while also fixing a copy error elsewhere on the page. If you object to only part of an edit, be careful to ''revert only the part you disagree with, leaving the rest alone''. The encyclopedia is damaged when positive contributions are caught up and lost in a revert. It is also impolite to the editor you are reverting, since if they wish to restore the uncontroversial portion of their edit, they must edit the page again, which can make it seem to others superficially reviewing the page history like they are edit warring, when actually they are not.

If you do feel that all parts of an edit containing multiple distinct changes warrant reversion, it is best practice to ''explain or at least note your objection to each change in the edit summary''. Otherwise, the other editor may reinstate the unaddressed portion of their edit, believing it to be uncontroversial.}}

* '''Comment''' Hodgdon&#39;s secret garden posted a malformed RfC and then moved this to "Joe Biden Senate aide controversy" without waiting to see what the consensus was. I reviewed the comments at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe Biden assault allegation]] and on this page and it looks like "Joe Biden sexual assault allegation" has the most support, so I changed it to that for now and created a properly formatted RfC. --[[User:Guy Macon|Guy Macon]] ([[User talk:Guy Macon|talk]]) 18:44, 13 April 2020 (UTC)}}

 I've a proposal to modify the lead of the "Millennials" article from saying,

"Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with 1981 to 1996 a widely accepted defining range for the generation."

to "Researchers and popular media ''typically'' use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s as ending birth years, with 1981 to 1996 a widely accepted defining range for the generation."

My justification here, as I've mentioned before, is that a whopping 27 sources in this article ended Millennials in the mid 90s. Only 4 sources in the body end the generation in the early 2000s (2000-2003), one of the them (the Census Bureau) even saying they don't officially define Millennials, another (CNN) saying "sometimes 1980–2000" (emphasis on "sometimes"), and the other two (Elwood Carlson and U.S. PIRG) being outdated sources from when this generation's identity was still heavily in flux.--[[User:CherokeeJack1|CherokeeJack1]] ([[User talk:CherokeeJack1|talk]]) 05:37, 18 March 2020 (UTC)}}

The section which [[WP:XY]] points, in its current state, is confusing. The reason being is that the section stated that "{{Tq|Redirects that could equally point to multiple targets are usually deleted}}", but then the examples it provides are all examples that include the word "and" in a way that joins at least two distinct topics/words. This is misleading since I have recently seen examples where [[WP:XY]] has been cited as a reason for deletion when the nominated redirect only contains ''one word'', and the claim is that the redirect could target multiple targets. With this being said, I propose that one of three resolutions occur ... and I honestly do not care which one, as long as the current state of this section does not remain:
#Change the wording from "{{Tq|Redirects that could equally point to multiple targets are usually deleted}}" to something like "{{Tq|Redirects that '''''contain multiple distinct subjects''''' are usually deleted}}"
#Add examples of RfDs where [[WP:XY]] has been cited where the redirect's title is only one word and/or does not contain a conjunction
#The first option, plus creating a new subsection of [[Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Common outcomes]] to reference discussions that are ambiguous but do not contain multiple distinct subjects in its title connected by a conjunction.

{{rfcquote|text=
From 27 to 30 March, we ran an RfC that resulted in the split of some territories ([[Template talk:2019–20 coronavirus pandemic data/Archive 8#New RfC on countries/dependencies|Link to RfC]]). While the decision did lead to a more stable situation, it did not cover all possible territories. These were deferred to a future discussion but no agreement was reached so far ([[Template talk:2019–20 coronavirus pandemic data/Archive 9#United States source|1]], [[Template talk:2019–20 coronavirus pandemic data/Archive 9#French overseas regions|2]], [[Template talk:2019–20 coronavirus pandemic data/Archive 9#Inconsistent Notes: Disputed Territories (Yes, again)|3]], [[Template talk:2019–20 coronavirus pandemic data/Archive 9#Abkhazia is listed as a country?|4]], [[Special:Permalink/949297092#Luhansk and Donetsk|5]], [[Special:Permalink/949297092#Flags of dependencies (especially those French ones)|6]], [[Special:Permalink/949297092#Lack of clarity and double counting. The same old debate on dependencies|7]], [[Special:Permalink/949297092#Åland Islands merged back|8]], [[Special:Permalink/949297092#Sahrawi PDR|9]]). After the implementation of the decision, we also faced some implementation problems such as the lack of reliable sources for [[overseas France]] after 26 March ([[Template talk:2019–20 coronavirus pandemic data/Archive 9#French overseas regions|example discussion]]) or that our criteria for some territories such as Åland Islands and the Akrotiri and Dhekelia was completely unique and not backed by any reliable source. Further discussions did not lead to any clear consensus to solve these disputes, and the original RfC did not provide enough guidance to solve them either. The goal of this RfC is to agree on more comprehensive criteria for territory listing. --[[User:MarioGom|MarioGom]] ([[User talk:MarioGom|talk]]) 19:41, 7 April 2020 (UTC)}}

2 proposals on new wording

'''Proposal 1'''- Should section addressing the availability of testing, currently reading, ''"Trump over-promised on testing"'' be changed to:

'''Trump also issued conflicting statements on the availability of testing for the virus....afterwards health officials clarified that testing would be available only to those with a doctor's prescription. Yet, many still struggled to get a test even with a doctor's prescription.'''

'''Proposal 2-'''  Should, "He [Trump] ''rejected'' health experts...be rephrased as Trump, "''disregarded'' health experts?"

{{rfcquote|text=
A flurry of edits have been made to this article, on [[Dave Fanning]], in the last month from two users: {{usertcb|johnoil9}} and {{usertcb|Davefanning12}}. While that in itself is not very noteworthy, it's a bit curious that for both accounts, no edits have been made to any other page on Wikipedia. This makes me slightly suspicious that it is the same person using multiple accounts. Per [[WP:MULTIPLE]], it is preferable that users not use multiple accounts (or disclose it where necessary) to avoid sockpuppetry issues. What also has me a little suspicious is the activity coming from Davefanning12. Several photos have been uploaded to Wikimedia Commons by this user that depict Fanning with prominent musicians ([https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dave_Fanning_and_U2_in_studio.jpg U2], [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dave_and_Bono.jpg Bono], [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dave_and_Billie_Eilish.jpg Billie Eilish]). The photos appear to be from Fanning's personal collection (the photo with Eilish was originally posted by the real-life Fanning [https://twitter.com/fanningrte/status/1167503883649855488/photo/1 in a tweet]). And the Commons file pages claim that they are the user Davefanning12's own work. So I see two possibilities: 1.) this user is just a fan of Fanning and improperly uploaded copyrighted, [[WP:NONFREE]] images to Commons, or 2.) the user is actually Fanning and owns the rights to the images but is creating a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] by editing his own page. I would appreciate others opinions on this.

==RFC'''

Hi there! We are proposing a research project to study the intersection between Wikimedia Commons and the needs and goals of other Wikimedia projects. We have four research questions: 
#What are the goals of the Commons?
#What are the goals of Commons curators (editors), and how do they participate to improve Commons?
#How do the goals of Commons curators (editors) align with the needs and goals of other Wikimedia projects?
#How do editors of other Wikimedia projects leverage the content of Commons to improve the quality of their projects?
We’d like to invite individual Commons Curators and Wikipedia Editors for a ~45 min interview to talk about their experience with contributing to Commons and/or using multimedia contents from Commons to illustrate other projects. Please help review our project page. Any comments/critics from the community would be appreciated!

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
It has been long-standing policy to disambiguate only when necessary, and otherwise choose a title that best incorporates the naming principles described at [[WP:CRITERIA]]. The logical conclusion of this, is that [[WP:PARENDIS|parenthetical disambiguation]] is not permitted unless the base title contains a disambiguation page, another article (i.e. the [[WP:PTOPIC|primary topic]]), or a [[WP:PRIMARYREDIRECT|primary redirect]] to a different page. In particular, the base title is not allowed to be empty or a primary redirect to the aforementioned parenthetically disambiguated title. However, there is a notable exception in [[WP:MUSICSERIES]], which mandates that Haydn's 100th symphony be called [[Symphony No. 100 (Haydn)]] even though he was the only composer to have written 100 notable symphonies, and in fact [[Symphony No. 100]] redirects there. The intuition behind this naming convention is that a name like "Symphony No. 100" is inherently ambiguous and should not contain an article on Haydn's work simply by happenstance. This principle may, perhaps, have relevance outside of generically numbered musical works.

'''Question:''' What is our view on parenthetically disambiguated titles which are not strictly necessary from a disambiguation point of view, but are part of a numbered series whose meaning is inherently ambiguous? [[Ahkam|Borrowing from the Koran]], should they be: 1) '''required'''; 2) '''recommended'''; 3) '''permitted'''; 4) '''discouraged'''; or 5) '''prohibited'''?

I'm proposing to remove the  "List of historically significant gay anthem songs" from this article. The table provides no context to entries. It doesn't explain what qualifies as them as a Gay Anthem (a lot of them weren't written to have LGBT themes, so without the context explaining how they became gay anthems anyway is leading out important information). The years are misleading because a lot of these songs became gay anthems years/decades after being released. And there's nothing to explain why these songs are historically significant, which a lot of them aren't. I would support a section in prose which includes a smaller list of noteworthy of gay anthems that provides context to how they became gay anthems and why they're particularly significantly. <span style="color:green;">[[User:JDDJS|<span style="color:green;">JDDJS</span>]] ([[User talk:JDDJS|<span style="color:purple;">talk to me</span>]] • [[Special:Contributions/JDDJS|<span style="color:purple;">see what I've done</span>]])</span> 15:09, 27 March 2020 (UTC)}}

How to deal with the redirect from [[Reading education]] to [[Reading education in the United States]]? The redirect from [[Reading education]] does not seem optimal, because it surprises readers who arrive here via a link to [[Reading education]] ([[WP:SURPRISE]]).

Should we use "mainland China" instead of "China" in article titles, given that the article covers area under the direct jurisdiction of the [[People's Republic of China]] only and excludes the [[special administrative regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] and the [[Political status of Taiwan|disputed]] [[Taiwan]].

==RfC on the title'''

*'''Note this is not a request for a move/rename, but rather what the name of this and future articles should be'''
Some editors and I have a disagreement about the title of the draft article. I moved the page from ''Effects of Hurricane Dorian in the United States'' to its current title per [[WP:PRECISION]] because it excludes US territories (United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico). In order to be "in the United States", I feel it must include all affected land that is owned by the United States. Without the territories, I think that that title would create ambiguity. [[List of United States hurricanes]] includes Alaska, Hawaii, and all territories. The other editors feel that United States itself implies only the mainland. I would appreciate feedback on this issue so we can establish a consensus on handling future articles.

This is [[WP:DUE]]/UNDUE:

In an opinion piece supportive of Finkelstein written for ''[[CounterPunch]]'', Los Angeles attorney Frank Menetrez asserted that "neither Dershowitz nor Harvard ... has identified the specific issues or arguments that Harvard allegedly investigated and rejected. In particular, neither of them has ever said whether Harvard investigated the identical errors issue".<ref name=Menetrez>Dr Frank J Menetrez, [http://www.counterpunch.org/menetrez02122008.html "The Case Against Alan Dershowitz"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218115934/http://www.counterpunch.org/menetrez02122008.html |date=February 18, 2008 }}, ''counterpunch.org'', accessed June 12, 2011</ref>

Should the {{para|based_on}} parameter in {{t|Infobox film}} on the article credit creators ([[Arnold Drake]], [[Gene Colan]]) of the original team? The film is not based on the original [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|1969 team]] but its rehashed [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|2008]] version but that shouldn't discount the original work by Drake and Colan especially when you consider that MCU films are mostly based on later stories but original creators are credited in infoboxes.

The question whether or not to use relief maps in the infobox for cities has come up often. There seems to be no set guidelines on these policies. For my part the relieft maps are more than a little distracting. Political maps properly show the placement of cities with the various political regions. While a relief map might be of use when commenting on the geography of a city and perhaps lay in that section. I would argue that political maps without relief should be the default. What is the actual policy on this though? It seems to be quite arbitrary on how and when these rules are applied. Thank you for any comment on this MoS for city infoboxes.

{{rfcquote|text=
[[Template:Welcome|The main welcome template]] was recently updated to a new style with a small set of large buttons, following [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)#Proposal to streamline the welcome template|discussion on the topic at the Village Pump]]. There has been discussion over whether, in the spirit of [[WP:CONSOLIDATE]], other welcome templates should be adjusted to become wrapper templates, either of [[Template:Welcome]] itself or any of a number of ''core'' templates.

The request for comment in this venue is specifically on the below questions:

'''Should all but a ''core'' of welcome templates become wrappers of members of that core?'''
* If so: {{ordered list|type=lower-latin
  | what should be the defining characteristic of the core?
  | which templates should wrap which?
}}
* If not: {{ordered list|start=3|type=lower-latin
  | is ''any'' modularisation of the templates a good idea?
  | how should welcome templates be kept in sync with each other - should they be at all?
}}

This article is twice the size any article ought to be. It furthermore harps on excessively on ecclesiastical Gothic - misleadingly titled "cathedrals" - to the exclusion of other types and uses of this type of architecture. This discussion deserves a new page, under Gothic Churches, which would also discuss those Gothic churches that are deemed cathedrals. I have requested the split, but the article also has numerous other issues and faults. It is primarily the doing of two editors, whose edits and additions dwarf the content added by anyone else, and the article, which is a popular one, and its talk page, require attention from other editors for balance and objectivity.

The Television Wikiproject have a strong consensus to default to official titles rather than common names per this discussion: [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Television#Episode_title_discussion]]. The RfC was notified here among other venues, so the assumption is that the matter has broad consensus. As such, if it is agreed that there is a broad consensus, it would be appropriate to make some form of amendment to the policy to indicate that [[WP:COMMONNAME]] does not apply to television programmes. I am not advocating one way or another, but setting this up so there is some clarity on the issue and prevent conflict between community policy and WikiProject practise. 

The question is: Should WP:COMMONNAME be amended to allow television episodes to default to official titles? [[User:SilkTork|SilkTork]] ([[User talk:SilkTork|talk]]) 14:55, 11 April 2020 (UTC)}}

We use [[Wikipedia:Non-free content|non-free content]] to illustrate articles where no freely licensed image is available. These files have limited usage due to legal restrictions, and they have to be locally uploaded as they are not allowed on Commons (or a number of other language Wikipedias). However, they can still have the same filenames as images on Commons, and when that happens, the local file gets priority over the one from Commons, which can cause legal issues from automated bot edits (e.g., [[Wikipedia:Bots/Noticeboard#Re-examination of ListeriaBot|Listeria]]) or other automatic transclusions, or if a local non-free image is uploaded to the same filename as a popular freely-licensed image. Additionally, it is not clear for reusers of our content that images are not freely licenced when looking at their filenames, which may cause downstream legal problems. It is also not clear when looking at article wikitext that the images aren't freely licenced, which may mean that we are using non-free content where we could be using freely-licensed content instead.

I proposes that all non-free media, i.e., those using {{tl|Non-free media}}, are renamed to include '(non-free)' in their filenames - or a similar phrase that is unlikely to be used in Commons filenames. This can be automatically changed by bot (which I can write and operate if there is consensus to do so), and will affect around 650,000 non-free files and their uses in a similar number of articles. Additionally, [[Wikipedia:Non-free content#Policy]] would be modified to add an 11th criteria: "Clear filename: the filename must include '(non-free)' to indicate that it is not freely-licenced". This will avoid non-free files shadowing commons files in the future; the accidental use of non-free files when trying to include freely-licensed files; and will generally make it more obvious that the use of these files is restricted.

There was [[Talk:ContraPoints#"Controversies"|a discussion back in January]] on the talk page of the article for [[ContraPoints]], in which the reliability of [https://www.pride.com/ Pride.com] was briefly discussed.

For example, [https://twitter.com/jessiegender Jessie Earl], who has also written for ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', has written articles for Pride.com. Fellow editor [[User:Bilorv|Bilorv]] agreed that the Pride.com article used on the ContraPoints page was an acceptable source in that case.

It is not possible to use machine translation in the English version of Content translation tool today (in April 2020).

However, this rule has not been changed in response to the January 2019 contract between GOOGLE and Wikimedia Foundation regarding GOOGLE translate.

Therefore, perhaps it assume Yandex translate which could be used before January 2019.

Comparing Yandex and GOOGLE translations, from my experience Yandex translation is awful (maybe it depends on the source and destination languages).
However, according to my experience, the GOOGLE translation into English is considerably higher quality than the GOOGLE translation into Japanese, and I (a non-English speaker and an English beginner) can understand the translated text. Therefore, when translating from other language to Japanese, in parallel I make English translation using GOOGLE translation. (I posted some text of them to DRAFT, as you can see in my post history)
I know, of course, that the translated text produced by GOOGLE Translator are not sufficient for English speakers.
However, I consider that an English-speaking person can correct an English expression by reading the English sentence created by the translation, even if he or she has little knowledge about the source language.
Therefore, I propose to enable machine translation for DRAFT and user page. I don't propose to enable machine translation for the standard space because I think some improvements by English speakers (as described above) should be done.

Thank you !!!

{{rfcquote|text=
Currently, [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)#Use of Stock nomenclature]] states:
<blockquote>Stock nomenclature should not be used for compounds with mixed or non-integral oxidation numbers: hence {{xt|{{nowrap|triiron tetraoxide}}}} ''not'' {{!xt|{{nowrap|iron(II,III) oxide}}}} (in fact, this article is difficult to name and, as an exception, redirects to [[magnetite]]).</blockquote>
The section on [[stock nomenclature]] has existed since [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ANaming_conventions_%28chemistry%29&type=revision&diff=18320566&oldid=16660257 July 2005]. However, one can see that there, in fact, does exist an article at [[Iron(II,III) oxide]] which is distinct from the [[Magnetite]] article and it was created in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iron%28II%2CIII%29_oxide&type=revision&diff=207144589&oldid=32825194 April 2008]. So for 12 years, apparently no one (apart from [[User:Double sharp|Double sharp]] above) has noticed this discrepancy in the very example that the guideline is trying to use to illustrate what not to do, suggesting that the guideline is not being enforced in practice. So what do we do here? I see several possibilities:
# Stock nomenclature #5 does not represent current community consensus, and should be struck or modified.
# [[Iron(II,III) oxide]] should be moved to [[Triiron tetraoxide]] to comply with the guideline.
# [[Iron(II,III) oxide]] should be merged into [[Magnetite]] to comply with the guideline.
I don't have a strong view but the current situation is rather risible.

On April 24, 2020, there was a release of previously-unseen documents relating to the investigation of Michael Flynn, including one that shows that, before the meeting with Flynn, one FBI agent had written, "What's our goal? Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?". Should this article mention this release of documents?

{{rfcquote|text=
I propose to change the behaviour of the [[Help:Citation Style 1|CS1]]/[[Help:Citation Style 2|2]] citation templates: the auto-linking mechanism (which provides a default value for {{para|url}} when {{para|pmc}} is available) would also cover {{para|doi}} with {{para|doi-access|free}}.

In short: if {{para|url}}, {{para|chapter-url}} and {{para|pmc}} are not set, but {{para|doi}} and {{para|doi-access|free}} are set, the title of the citation would be linked using the DOI.

'''Example'''

With the following code:

<code><nowiki>
{{cite journal |author1= Hoffman S.J. |author2=Lavis J.N. |author3=Bennett S. | year = 2009 | title = The Use of Research Evidence in Two International Organizations' Recommendations about Health Systems | journal = Healthcare Policy | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 66–86 | doi = 10.12927/hcpol.2009.21005 | doi-access = free }}
</nowiki></code>

You would get the same result as if {{para|url|https://doi.org/10.12927/hcpol.2009.21005}} was set:

* {{cite journal |author1= Hoffman S.J. |author2=Lavis J.N. |author3=Bennett S. | year = 2009 | title = The Use of Research Evidence in Two International Organizations' Recommendations about Health Systems | journal = Healthcare Policy | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 66–86 | doi = 10.12927/hcpol.2009.21005 | doi-access = free | url = https://doi.org/10.12927/hcpol.2009.21005 |ref=none}}

This affects multiple pages, so I thought this would be the best place for a discussion.

We have always used a stadium's actual location instead of the official FIFA host city in the venue tables, for example, [[Pontiac, Michigan]] instead of [[Detroit]] for the [[Pontiac Silverdome]]. On [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup]], and [[2026 FIFA World Cup]], the tables have recently been edited to the names of the official FIFA host cities, so "Detroit" instead of "Pontiac" is displayed more prominently in the table. Both of these are factually true: Detroit was the host city, but games were played in Pontiac. Since this may impact other World Cup articles (for instance, the 2002 world cup shows Miyagi, but the FIFA web site shows Rifu).

Should the table of venues be changed to display the host city, where the host city differs from the stadium location?

I have encountered [[Talk:Chicken or the egg#Disputed see also entry|the claim]] that adding a link {{tquote|doesn't require a citation}}, even when [[WP:CHALLENGE]]d. (To be clear: I did not ask for an ''inline'' citation, merely that one be provided on the talk page.) Another editor subsequently claimed that [[MOS:SEEALSO]]'s criterion of "editorial judgment and common sense" is among the {{tquote|things that go [...] beyond the verifiabilty principle}}.

My reasoning is that, since See also links have to be relevant, adding a link comes with the implicit claim that the linked topic is relevant to the one at hand. In this particular instance, the stronger claim was made that the linked topic is an instance of the topic linked from. Since [[WP:PROVEIT|all content must be verifiable]], I don't see how See also should escape one of our pillars. That needs to be clarified here, regardless of the outcome of this RfC.

Since there's a thread at BN about bureaucrat activity, and I've told people the way to solve the problem is by creating an RfC, I'll go ahead and start one. I'm proposing the activity policy for bureaucrats be updated to the following:
{{talkquote|Bureaucrats who do not have qualifying bureaucrat activity within the last two years before will have the bureaucrat permissions removed for inactivity, and may only have the bureaucrat permission restored by a new successful request for bureaucratship. Users will be notified one month prior to removal of their permissions. Qualifying bureaucrat activity shall consist of the following:
*Granting or removing permissions that can only be done by a bureaucrat
*Closing of discussions that are restricted by policy to bureaucrats
*Participation in bureaucrat discussions either as a part for requests for adminship or bureacratship or as a part of ordinary discussions at the bureaucrats' noticeboard.
Simply expressing willingness to participate as a bureaucrat without activity is not considered activity for the purposes of maintaining permissions. Bureaucrats who have their administrator permissions procedurally removed for inactivity will also have the bureaucrat permissions removed, but may request them back if they return to activity and would otherwise qualify as an active bureaucrat.}}

This is a proposal to create a new usergroup, main page editor, as documented at [[Wikipedia:Main page editor]].

This will allow editors with this permission to update content on the main page, and to fix errors on it. Details of the proposed mechanisms to grant and remove the right, and restrictions on its use, are at [[Wikipedia:Main page editor]]. If this request is successful, a phabricator request will be initiated, and once completed, [[Wikipedia:Main page editor]] will be changed from a proposal to a policy page and appropriately updated.

The question is quite simple:
# Suppose there are two people called "John Smith" who are notable for playing the sport known officially as [[Association football]]. One of them is an American soccer player and the other is a British footballer. Is "John Smith (soccer)" and "John Smith (footballer)" adequate parenthetical disambiguation, or do more disambiguators such as nationality or year of birth need to be used?
# Now suppose there are multiple British footballers called "John Smith" who are already disambiguated by their year of birth, but still only one American soccer player. What is the correct parenthetical disambiguation for the American?
Reading the current guideline does not make it clear whether football and soccer are intended to be treated as different sports or the same sport for the purposes of disambiguation.

There are two organizations who raise private funds to commission a presidential portrait. As explained by TIME here, [https://time.com/5140261/official-presidential-portraits-history/ "In more recent history, the money has come from private donations, usually raised by the National Portrait Gallery. (The White House Historical Association has also raised private funds for portraits, but that’s a separate operation.)"]. Such presidents as Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43, and Obama have had separate portraits painted by both entities, with Clinton's and Obama's explained within the article.

Should we have a separate list of National Portrait Gallery portraits in this article, with such examples as John Quincy Adams's (above) and James Buchanan's (below).

The [[Catholic News Service]] was established in 1920 by the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]. It remains sponsored by the bishops. However, they are [https://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2010/usccb-communications-department-to-undergo-reorganization.cfm "editorially independent and a financially self-sustaining"] department of the bishops' conference (link is to their website but Google seems to think this is true). Their mission is to be "a leading agency for religious news. Our mission is to report fully, fairly and freely on the involvement of the church in the world today. CNS staff members and stringers are professional journalists who adhere to ethical practices and standards of the trade." [https://www.nzcatholic.org.nz/about-us/news-services/ They are] "used by about 240 newspapers, broadcasters and other news outlets in over 35 countries." 

They are established, editorially independent, financially self-sustaining, and trusted around the world. They are also an arm of the United States bishops.

A number of editors have repeatedly removed Donald Trump's directly stated views on racism on the basis that the statements are not credible, or that any racist would say they are not racist or condemn racism.  Others have argued that Trump's directly stated views are highly relevant to a page on Donald Trump's views, and should be featured at least as prominently as his critics' views.

A related issue concerns NPOV, while several of us have argued there are serious POV issues on the page, when the tag is added it is simply removed.

I'm not overly familiar with Wikipedia's rules and policies, so I apologise if this too lengthy or is otherwise inappropriate, but I think this discussion needs some external input.

{{rfcquote|text=
Under the ''Discography'' section of the article, Limp Bizkit's major releases are listed; however, their 2005 EP ''The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)'' is not listed. This is because many editors quickly undo the edits as they think it is against Wikipedia's guidelines. It is true, that Wikipedia says not to include EPs and other non full-length albums; however, the exact quote is: ''"Live and compilation albums, EPs, singles, etc. should generally not be included."'' GENERALLY is the key word here. Another quote from the WikiProject Discographies Style's page: ''"In an ideal situation however, any deviations from the guidelines should be with a clear purpose that is unique to the particular artist and situation in question."'' This supports the fact that the guidelines of not including EPs is NOT set in stone, and that it should be treated on a case-by-case basis.

'''To what extent should this article discuss the scientific consensus on reparative/conversion therapy's potential harms and benefits?'''

Participants on both sides of this debate believe the other side's preferences would constitute [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]].{{efn|I hesitate using the word "sides" because it might inaccurately imply a clear demarcation between the beliefs of two diametrically opposed camps, which is not the case. Please read the discussions above. (The entire talk page constitutes the debate.)}} 

One side believes that devoting substantial discussion of the aforementioned scientific consensus to an article about a book constitutes undue weight. 

The other side believes that failure to adequately discuss the medical and psychological consensus constitutes an dereliction of duty (so to speak) to ensure that readers understand that "reparative therapy" is a [[WP:FRINGE|fringe theory]] that harms patients.

 New rule for Czech Republic and Slovakia charts.

I think the fact that the common use of the term is derogatory or pejorative needs to be included in the lede, it's like leaving "During daylight, the sky appears to be blue" out of the Sky article's lede.

Regarding suggestion that Biden sexual assault allegation article needs to include more material concerning accuser's back story. Currently the article contains only material concerning her educational background (see [[Joe Biden sexual assault allegation#Controversy over Reade's educational background]]). But much more has been found of revelance; see for example: 
#[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/politics/tara-reade-joe-biden.html nytimes] feature on Reade's background: ''".. Ms. Reade’s own back story has been caught up in the churn of #MeToo-era politics, as rising questions about her credibility add fuel to the social-media combat between Mr. Biden’s defenders and detractors. .. Ms. Reade, through her own pluck and smarts and powers of persuasion, overcame an unsettled and abusive childhood to find opportunities on the big stages of acting, politics and law. She won praise for what friends took as a sincere commitment to helping other abuse victims and to animal rescue. .. The Times’s findings comport with the autobiography Ms. Reade, now 56, has rendered in cinematic detail across blog posts, online essays and court statements. But in the dramatic retelling of her life story she has also shown a tendency to embellish — a role as a movie extra is presented as a break; her title of “staff assistant” with clerical responsibilities in Mr. Biden’s office becomes “legislative assistant” when his shepherding of the Violence Against Women Act is an asset for her expert-witness testimony in court. .."''

Specific instance - the Alabama Covid-19 page. [[2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Alabama]]

In recent weeks, with the push from business to reopen the economy, the actual daily increase in the number of infected and the daily increase in the number of fatalities have become highly relevent statistics because federal guidelines called for a consistant decrease in those numbers before economies should relax their stay at home directives. These daily statistics had been presented in charts on the wikipedia page as per this older version of the page.
 https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Alabama&amp;oldid=952992317

I had noticed the stats in those tables had been updated consistantly since the beginning of March but the daily updates suddenly stopped about two weeks ago. I tried to update them myself but I found the edits I made did not show up on the charts. I assume this means the charts are locked to prevent editing? Shortly after that those two charts were removed completely, the edit comment claims the reason is because the data those charts presented was already contained in the main chart which it clearly is not.

Although it is possible to calculate the daily numbers by using the data from the main chart, the actual daily number of new infections and the actual number of new fatalities is not presented by the main chart. I reversed the aformentioned edit to put back the charts that had been removed but they were subsequently removed again the next day. 

You can see, the only other way to source the actual number of fatalities each day is to manually calculate them from the main chart. Even the Alabama Dept of Health website is only presenting cumulative numbers. It seems to me, the political motivation for obscuring the actual daily numbers of new infections and new fatalities is obvious when the federal guidlines for reopening economies assumes access to those daily numbers. So what do we do about this? [[User:Raven9nine|Raven9nine]] ([[User talk:Raven9nine|talk]]) 15:57, 10 May 2020 (UTC)}}

Hello! Another source that has raised questions: [[PanAm Post]]. I noticed that PanAm Post was describing a member of their staff as having a Harvard University "degree". They say that Emmanuel Rincón, a self-published author {{small|([[WP:QUESTIONABLE]]/[[WP:RSSELF]])}} who writes for the site, has "[https://panampost.com/author/emmanuel-rincon/ a degree in Modern Masterpieces of World Literature from Harvard University]". That "degree" is a free [[edX]] course provided by Harvard ([https://www.edx.org/course/modern-masterpieces-of-world-literature see here, where 40,000 people are already enrolled!]). This raises concerns about their reliability and if the site exaggerates the credentials of their staff (or their reporting).

So I am asking the community to decide the following evaluations about PanAm Post:

*'''Option 1:''' Generally [[WP:RS|reliable]] for factual reporting	
*'''Option 2:''' Unclear or additional considerations apply	
*'''Option 3:''' Generally [[WP:QUESTIONABLE|unreliable]] for factual reporting
*'''Option 4:''' Publishes false or fabricated information, and should be [[WP:DEPS|deprecated]]

Not sure if these type of RSN RfCs are still permitted since changes were proposed when I was last active, but a few opinions on this source would be appreciated!----[[User:ZiaLater|<i style="text-shadow:#C0C0C0 0.2em 0.2em 0.2em; color: ForestGreen">ZiaLater</i>]] ([[User talk:ZiaLater|<span style="color: ForestGreen">talk</span>]]) 04:54, 20 May 2020 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Briefly summarizing, a disagreement has arose regarding content within the COVID-19 subheading of Whitmer's article. Most of my points have already been established regarding why it needs major revision above, but I'll quickly restate myself starting with the subheading itself:

*COVID-19, not Covid-19.
*It hasn't been an epidemic in several weeks, even the "main article" link acknowledges this.
*"leadership" is clearly implying praise on her part, we don't do this for [[Donald Trump]], [[Mike Pence]], [[Gavin Newsom]], [[Andrew Cuomo]], for instance. In fact, this article can take example from Cuomo's, who has undoubtedly received greater media coverage regarding this pandemic than Whitmer ever has.

Now, [[User:NorthBySouthBaranof|NorthBySouthBaranof]] has argued against the inclusion of the protestors, claiming they are a "small minority viewpoint". Despite this, he agrees to include the judge's decision, which is inherently linked to the protests, and aren't even in favor of the protests as it is. When I brought it back for the shake of context, NorthBySouth decided to bring back the emotional appeal of a dead child's mother's testimony. Not only does this affect the NPOV of this article, it contradicts NorthBySouth regarding what constitutes a "small minority viewpoint".

I propose we revert back to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gretchen_Whitmer&type=revision&diff=956689094&oldid=956565251 my edit here] excluding the SNL and rap group fluff, which we both agreed is irrelevant already.

In the previous RfC, I made several comments that were interpreted as being off topic. My comments were not intended to be off topic. Anyway, I still believe that black and white supremacy need to be described as the same thing. I have mentioned that even if there is an almost universal opinion on an issue, there will still be those that disagree. I have also mentioned this quote from [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]:
*“A doctrine of black supremacy is as dangerous as a doctrine of white supremacy. God is not interested in the freedom of black men or brown men or yellow men. God is interested in the freedom of the whole human race, the creation of a society where every man will respect the dignity and worth of personality.”
:Source: [https://prospect.org/civil-rights/martin-luther-king-jr.-50-years/]
This quote says that all types of racial supremacies are dangerous. I believe that this quote should be used to make the decision on how to describe both supremacies. I have also mentioned that we could support our descriptions of supremacies if we add polls based on [[Political ideologies in the United States|political ideologies]] and [[List of political parties in the United States|political parties]]. I would like to know everyone's opinions on everything that I just mentioned. [[User:GamerKiller2347|GamerKiller2347]] ([[User talk:GamerKiller2347|talk]]) 19:21, 15 June 2020 (UTC)}}

This section is in woefully bad condition and I will be rewriting it, but there are two issues that I'd like to bring up for discussion. First of all, the page title. The main subject here (although you can't tell by looking at the page at this point) is mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) and Graeco-Latin squares are just a special case. This special case does have an interesting history, but the name is rather passé except possibly in some application areas. When I'm finished revising the page, I'll ask for a title change if other editors agree. The second point (and more ticklish one) has to do with the big bright example of a compounded MOLS 5 that has been on the page in one form or another since March 2009. I like the example, it is correct and well crafted ... but it is also completely [[WP:OR]]. Other editors must have felt the same as I do, it is just too good to toss. I will be rewriting the section so that this example is not as prominent (it makes for a poor introduction to the topic) and I can explain what it is in more traditional terms. I would like to see some consensus to keep the diagram even though it is OR.--[[User:Wcherowi|Bill Cherowitzo ]] ([[User talk:Wcherowi|talk]]) 18:33, 19 June 2020 (UTC)}}

I'm quite surprised that I haven't seen any discussions relating to these three criteria. It appears (at least to me) that U1, U2, and U5 can be merged into G7, G8, and G11, respectively.
:U1 - User pages are only supposed to be edited by their respective users, so if the user requests the deletion of their user page in good faith, then it fits under G7 because they are the only contributor. G7 and U1 proposals are even merged into [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion by user]].
:U2 - User pages of nonexistent users can easily be superseded by G8 with the addition of a single bullet point.
:U5 - This one may be slightly controversial, but blatantly misusing user pages as web hosts can easily fit under G11 (pure advertising). However, I am at a loss for exactly how to fit such a criterion. Consensus anyone?

I suggest that the dating across not only this but all the Islamic articles are to be Hijri (Hj.) or Before Hijra (BH.) and then BCE/CE added in braces like; '''Umayyad Mosque was constructed circa 86-96 Hj. (705–715 CE)'''.

I am aware that is going to be quite a tedious and time consuming task and may also be somewhat confusing for someone reading the article for the first time, but in the longer run it will add a new aspect to the relevant articles and content which will not only present a non-christian and neutral tone of the content but also add a the "academic touch" as well, as the BCE and CE have become more academically adopted. Please see following for a more detailed explanation; these sources can be found here ([[Anno_Domini#CE_and_BCE]]) as well

I don't how there hasn't been an RfC on this before, perhaps the talk page was difficult to find for some. I think using the dagger icon (which resembles the [[Christian cross]]) for KIA is a bit confusing when representing KIA (Killed in action) for non-western editors, such as Chinese,  Hindu's and Muslims who comprise about 3/4 of worlds population. I propose changing the dagger icon to skull, which is the universal symbol of death. The skull icon is currently used on [[Template:Executed]] so if this passes I think that should be changed with abbreviation (EXE) for executed.

{{rfcquote|text=
When describing periodical works such as newspapers, magazines, journals, comic books, radio programs, televisions shows, podcasts, and web series that are no longer published, should we use "is" or "was"?

For example:
* "''Gourmet'' is a magazine that was published from 1941 to 2009" vs. "''Gourmet'' was a magazine published from 1941 to 2009"
* "''I Love Lucy'' is a TV show that ran from 1951 to 1957" vs. "''I Love Lucy'' was a TV show that ran from 1951 to 1957".

Note that the MoS guideline that covers this question is [[WP:WAS]], which says {{tq|By default, write articles in the present tense, including those covering works of fiction...and products or works that have been discontinued. Generally, do not use past tense except for past events and subjects that are dead or no longer meaningfully exist.}}  However, attempts to resolve the question this RfC is asking by referring to this have not agreed on whether defunct periodicals should be considered to be "dead...and no longer meaningfully exist" -- see [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#WP:WAS and defunct magazines]].

If you believe some types of periodical should use "was" and the others should use "is", please make that clear in your response.

There was [[Talk:ContraPoints#"Controversies"|a discussion back in January]] on the talk page of the article for [[ContraPoints]], in which the reliability of [https://www.pride.com/ Pride.com] was briefly discussed. In the discussion, I asserted that the reliability of the website should probably be taken on a case-by-case basis. The site is said to [https://web.archive.org/web/20180130204433/http://www.magazine.org/industry-news/press-releases/member-press-releases/here-media-introduces-pridecom prominently feature user-submitted content], but it also has an editorial director, and features content by established figures. For example, [https://twitter.com/jessiegender Jessie Earl], who has also written for ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', has written articles for Pride.com. Fellow editor [[User:Bilorv|Bilorv]] agreed that the Pride.com article used on the ContraPoints page was an acceptable source in that case. However, I'd like more editors to weigh in, so perhaps a consensus regarding the site's status as generally reliable, generally unreliable, or marginally reliable could be listed at [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources|WP:RSP]].

[[WP:USEENGLISH]] says that we should use the name which is mostly commonly found in English-language sources. Sometimes, as with the [[Technical University of Berlin|Technical University of Berlin / Technische Universität Berlin]], both the native name and a translation are widely used in English sources and it is impossible to tell which one is more common. In these cases, what should the tiebreaker be?
# Give the edge to the [[WP:OFFICIALNAME]], i.e. what the subject would prefer to be known as in English, which could be the native name or the translation.
# Give the edge to the English translation. Note that [[WP:USEENGLISH]] does not currently say that we prefer names in English, but rather names which are most commonly used in English sources.
# Keep the long-standing title, per [[WP:TITLECHANGES]]. This is the general default option when there is no specific guidance to do something different.

I am now initiating a vote since there is an escalating dispute as to who did formally accuse Michael Jackson of child sexual abuse: Evan Chandler, his son Jordan Chandler or the two of them.

'''I ask that''' Banananasas' edit[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Square_One:_Michael_Jackson&diff=959690452&oldid=959659753] that reads: "''Square One'' is an independent investigative documentary that examines the original child sexual abuse allegations by Jordan Chandler, a 13 year old boy, against Michael Jackson." be changed back to "''Square One'' is an independent investigative documentary that examines the original child sexual abuse allegations brought against Jackson first by Evan Chandler and then by his son Jordan Chandler."

{{rfcquote|text=
The page underwent major changes with the addition of self-published sources. 

Prior to these changes, the article was [[Special:Permalink/950753453|this]], and specifically cited several sources which discussed the various proposed origins of the Soomro tribe, including native Sindhi, Rajput, Arab, and mixed-Arab heritage. Following the edits of a rather zealous editor, any discussion of the various theorized origins was completely obliterated, and the page presented one-sided information that made it seem that their potential Rajput origins were an open-and-shut case. He goes on to introduce a random story about their origins that was self-published by Harjani. There was a discussion about this author and his work at [[WP:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive 294#Notion_Press_publications]], and when it was removed, he re-introduced it with the crazy edit summary that [[Special:Diff/960271226|he was the one removing self-published source]], even though he clearly reinserted it. 

He also changed several terms to introduce POV - such as that "some members of the tribe converted to Islam," even though this is an almost entirely Muslim tribe now - downplaying the current religion. In the infobox he tries to change this fact by including Hinduism as a current religion of the tribe, though if you actually read his citation, the only claim is that the tribe converted from Hinduism, not that they are currently Hindus. He also introduces subtle terms to emphasize this suggestion, like that this is not a tribe, but instead a "caste." 

His edits are reintroduced on this and other pages with {{u|Srijanx22}}, whose infopage says he enjoys "trolling leftists."

Please add your perspective on whether this is disruptive. The two together are difficult to counter, since it doesnt seem like theyre interested in fact, and are much more interested in promoting POV. 03:10, 2 June 2020 (UTC)}}

# Should we preemptively disambiguate when the topic can only reasonably exist for A, such as [[President of Georgia]]?
# Should we preemptively disambiguate when no article currently exists for B, but one could theoretically be created, such as [[Law of Georgia (U.S. state)]]?
# When B is geographically part of A, should we preemptively disambiguate when no article currently exists for B, but one could theoretically be created, such as [[List of beaches in New York]]?

::''{{tq|In July of 2019 a previously undisclosed tape recorded in the Nixon White House was released. In the audio recording, made in 1971 and documenting a phone conversation between then-President Nixon and then-Governor Reagan, Mr. Reagan can be heard saying, “To see those, those monkeys from those African countries—damn them, they’re still uncomfortable wearing shoes!“ <ref> <iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/353811584" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </ref> This statement was made in reference to a United Nations delegation from Tanzania, which opposed the United States in a vote to officially recognize the People’s Republic of China.

* {{article|Mr. Wrestling II}}
Recently it has come to my attention of a bit of a content dispute, which focuses on whether Mr. Wrestling II was a registered sex offender. The editors involved are all IPv6 anonymous editors, and they've seemed to be getting into an edit war over this (see {{pagehistory|Mr. Wrestling II|history}}).

This is quite a controversial topic, and its sudden addition [[Mr. Wrestling II#Death|just after his death]] does raise some red flags. However, the content is sourced twice, both in a sex offender registry ([https://www.homefacts.com/offender-detail/HIA0031098/John-F-Walker.html]) and a clipping from the [[Honolulu Advertiser]] ([https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19212498/mr-wrestling-ii-johnny-walker-rape/]) clipped in 2018.

Is the content acceptable to include into the article?

Requesting a peer review and changes to the article. I do not believe it to be correct or objective. For example the first sentence "is an American celebrity doctor who advocates what he calls a micronutrient-rich diet" is a subjective statement and is mis-quoted from the original reference which states "...and his nutrient density program..." page 41. Regardless this subcategory idea is not appropriate for the introduction of the subject. I propose a more accurate and fair introduction: "...is a Board Certified physician and author based in New Jersey."

The entire Diet and health section is essentially controversial material from one perspective (against) the subject. I propose renaming this heading to "Diet Controversy..." where all of the controversial material can go instead of being scattered throughout the entire article. Thank you.

Shall we summarize the following:

{{tq|According to a BBC article, the US government described the MEK as a "Cult", with one US colonel saying "the organisation was a cult", and yet another retired US general saying "Cult? How about admirably focused group?". United States Department of State describes MEK in a 2008 report as "cult-like terrorist organisation". Iraq's ambassador to the U.S., Samir Sumaidaie, said in 2011 that the MEK was "nothing more than a cult". Some academics, including Ervand Abrahamian, Stephanie Cronin, Wilfried Buchta, Eli Clifton and others have also made similar claims. Former French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal criticized the MEK for having a "cult nature"; while Former French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said that he was "ashamed" by this statement.|}}

{{tq|A report commissioned by the US government, based on interviews within Camp Ashraf, concluded that the MEK had "many of the typical characteristics of a cult, such as authoritarian control, confiscation of assets, sexual control (including mandatory divorce and celibacy), emotional isolation, forced labour, sleep deprivation, physical abuse and limited exit options". In 2003 Elizabeth Rubin referred to the MEK as "Cult of Rajavi".|}} [[User:Stefka Bulgaria|Stefka Bulgaria]] ([[User talk:Stefka Bulgaria|talk]]) 09:40, 14 June 2020 (UTC)}}

This RfC asks:
1) Can the above source be relied upon solely for the purpose of alleging that the tweets were made? You'll note the blog posts contain screen shots of the alleged tweets.
2) Had the offending tweets not been deleted, could they be relied on as a source given Mr Well's twitter account is "verified"?
3) If the answer to either of the above is "no", what is preventing Mr Well's from continuing to make inflammatory tweets and delete them, without any being able to attract criticism on Wikipedia?

2. If the answer to the above is yes, then which Wikipedia policy merits its inclusion as a reliable source?

 I would like third-party feedback on the following questions:
* When an institution or other thing is named after a person, should this person be brought up in a way that focuses on naming-specific issues (why was the thing named after this person and what (potential) controversies are there around this naming)? Or should the mention focus on what makes the person notable in general? Or a bit of both?
* Is the fact that Berkeley is named after a slave owner only [[WP:DUE|appropriate to include]] when there is a (sufficiently non-fringe) active activist effort to specifically rename UC Berkeley? Or do the many attempts to destroy the statues of slave owners and to rename institutions, buildings and such that are named after slave owners, open racists and such, indicate that there is a general interest in knowing whether something is named after a person who was a slave owner?

Note that there seems to be no disagreement that Berkeley was a slave owner, so I see no need for people to provide feedback on that issue. [[User:Aapjes|Aapjes]] ([[User talk:Aapjes#top|talk]] 14:25, 9 July 2020 (UTC)}}

Asking to be able to include the United Kingdom as part of the person's birth place and death place in the infobox, for the following reasons. Firstly, the person is specifically defined as British in both the infobox and the main text. The corresponding sovereign state to British nationality is the UK. Secondly, under [[Template:Infobox person]], for birth place and death place it is stated we include under each "city, administrative region, sovereign state." The sovereign state in this instance is the United Kingdom (not England or Wales). Thirdly the prominence of this article is largely due to the person being known for being the last woman executed in the UK. Therefore contextually the article has far more relevance to the UK as a whole than England or Wales (the law being applied was UK law also, not relevant to specifically England or Wales). Adding the UK only helps greater inform global [[Wikipedia:Reader|readers]] of the article with little or no knowledge of the subject. See [[WP:DRDR]] and [[WP:RF]]. Providing more correct factual information that also adds as clarification only aids the informativeness of the page, it does not take it away.

Should the article include https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/resellers/psu-selector.html as Intel requires all the 80 Plus spec., but not only that (see information above), they also add info for tested PSU about ErP when you turn off PC (there are always some parts of cumputer that work even when PC is turned off), they also test Modern Standy (Always On, Always Connected, when PC works like smartphone, it will be used in next notebook bigLittle Intel Cores), also there are some min. requirements for C6-C9 sleep states. That was a problem in the past when PSU were not compatible. We should not only use one source for tests (from 80 Plus itself, it is just wrong as we must not use primary sources).

I propose that the section ''[[Chrysler#Chrysler brand|Chrysler brand]]'' be split into a separate article called ''[[Chrysler]]'' and the remaining sections of this article be titled '''[[FCA US]]'''. The company that was once know as Chrysler has officially been named FCA US for a number of years now and the Chrysler name merely lives on as a vehicle brand of the parent company. The [[Chrysler#Chrysler brand|Chrysler brand]] section is adequately sized to be its own article. Currently, all of [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]]' brands have their own articles except for Chrysler. [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]]' other direct subsidiary is [[FCA Italy]] which already has its own article separate from the [[Fiat]] brand, so there is precedent for this split. Chrysler is no longer even [[FCA US]]'s top brand and it is arguably not even a household name anymore. When the merger of [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] and [[Groupe PSA]] is complete, Chrysler won't even be in the name of the parent company anymore as it is being renamed [[Stellantis]].

Is integer division well defined in mathematics, and in computer programming languages?

Many of the algorithms in the article use the integer division operation (but no use is made of the remainder, which might be thought of in math as one of the results of a division, the other result being the quotient). But [[User:Eric Kvaalen|Eric Kvaalen]] states in the thread [[#Wrong formulas]] ' All I'm saying is that we can rewrite the formulas to use FLOOR instead of so-called "integer division" which is not well defined and not commonly understood.'

{{rfcquote|text=
I'm a bit lost here as to where the articles [[Welfare]] and [[Social security]] differ. The leads of both articles describe their subject as payments to those with little or no income for the purpose of subsidising/paying for/assisting with basic human needs. Even in this article, the terms "welfare" and "social security" are thrown around as synonyms for each other. When you strip down the topics to their core subject, surely [[welfare]] and [[social security]] are one and the same? If not, there needs to be serious work done on both, as they are indistinguishable right now. I also think it's worth considering the influence of [[Americentrism|americentric bias]] in these topics; they seem to focus quite heavily on only the US' system of welfare (or lack thereof), and truly, don't fairly or equally explore other countries where welfare is significantly more important. Even the term "social security" points to the United States - In Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and many many many more countries, it's called welfare, Germany and parts of Europe calls it social care, the UK calls it state welfare. You can even see on this Google Trends map that "social security" is almost exclusively American: [https://ibb.co/zSxrBHq https://ibb.co/zSxrBHq].

Traditionally, the '''Hanging Gardens''' (the Wonder of the Ancient World) were thought to have been in Babylon.  The current Wikipedia article is entitled '''Hanging Gardens of Babylon'''.  Some very credible academic work has argued that the Hanging Gardens were actually in Nineveh, making both historical-literary and archaelogical arguments.  There are two questions: to what extent is there a 'consensus' view that the Hanging Gardens definitely were in Nineveh as opposed to the idea being just one interesting and compelling hypothesis? And: what is the best title for the page - '''Hanging Gardens of Babylon''', '''Hanging Gardens of Nineveh''' or simply '''Hanging Gardens'''? At the moment, discussion is between a very small number of editors, and it would benefit from wider perspectives.

Should the following sentence be temporarily added to [[Wikipedia:Administrators#Restoration_of_adminship]] (in the "over two years with no edits" bullet)?

:Adminstrators desysopped on or before November 4, 2019 may be resysopped if they have made at least one edit in the last ''three years'' (rather than two years), as long as they file their resysop request before 00:00 UTC on October 1, 2020. This means that admins that meet these criteria and were desysopped for inactivity may be resysopped if they have edited in the past ''two years'' (rather than one year).

In addition, admins that would have been eligible for resysop under the pre-2019 rules should be notified of the 2019 rule change and the existence of this grace period.

This is in response to a question raised at a resysop request on [[WP:BN]]. Hopefully this RfC will clear up confusion on this and any future similar cases.

There is a dispute about whether to include the [[District of Columbia]] and the [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] (in tables) within the [[Political party strength in U.S. states]] article. The five U.S. territories are [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]. The proposal to include the District of Columbia and territories would involve moving the article to "Political party strength in the U.S. states and territories" or simply "Political party strength in the United States". The argument in favor of including the District of Columbia and territories in the article is that these political entities are often considered state-equivalents, with state-like characteristics (such as governors and legislatures). The opposing argument is that the District of Columbia and territories are not relevant to the article. 20:22, 30 June 2020 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Consistency in category names and the main article is positively helpful in some hierarchies, e.g. music albums, because of the use of {{tl|albums category}} then automatically links to the main article, the head category and the songs category, e.g. [[:Category:1927 (band) albums]]. In that example, we are committed to keeping the disambiguator "(band)" as part of all the related category names. 

However, great minds have told us that
:"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds" – [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]
:"Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative" – [[Oscar Wilde]]

In other hierarchies we are rolling out consistency even where there is little apparent gain. For example, [[Terminator (disambiguation)|Terminator]] is a disambiguation page covering e.g. gene terminator as well as the famous film series and its spin-off media, whose main article therefore has to be [[Terminator (franchise)]]. The main category is therefore likewise [[:Category:Terminator (franchise)]]. The debatable point is that [[WP:C2C]] is then invoked to rename all its sub-cats e.g. [[:Category:Terminator films]] to [[:Category:Terminator (franchise) films]]. IMHO this would result in longwinded and clumsy titles for insufficient gain. 

I therefore propose that the disambiguator "(franchise)" should '''generally''' not be replicated into sub-category names for e.g. specific media types within a franchise hierarchy. Only the top category for that franchise needs to contain the word "(franchise)".

Likewise, similar disambiguators may also be excluded from the general requirement for consistency, e.g. the disambiguators "(film series)", "(TV series)" and "(video game series)" probably do not need to be replicated down to categories of characters, episodes etc, except where there is ambiguity at that level. – [[User:Fayenatic london|Fayenatic]] [[User talk:Fayenatic london|'''<span style="color:#FF0000;">L</span>'''ondon]] 09:23, 2 July 2020 (UTC)}}

Should this article be tagged with [[WP:COI]], [[WP:AB]] and [[WP:NPOV]] template messages.
Also, because we already have sections on "Views", "Activism" and "Controversies", should we balance its narratives, while we could also create a section on "Style, Techniques and Themes". I have found three excellent sources in Serbo-Croatian (see above sections), there is one in Norwegian provided by [[User:Tataral]]. It would be great to have few in English. --[[User:Santasa99|<span style="color:maroon;text-shadow:#666362 0.2em 0.2em 0.4em;font-size:0.8em;">'''౪ Santa ౪'''</span>]][[User talk:Santasa99|<span style="color:navy;text-shadow:grey 0.2em 0.2em 0.4em;font-size:0.7em"><sup>'''''99°'''''</sup></span>]] 02:07, 4 July 2020 (UTC)}}

== RfC: Let's define self-published sources '''

Consensus above (no objections) was that this policy should define SPS (which makes sense, because it's impossible to apply the policy if we don't know what SPS is and what it's not).  So let's hear some suggested definitions, please.  (I'd offer mine, except that I don't have strong feelings about what the definition should be (just that we should have one), and when I copied the one from WP:USINGSPS (publisher=author), it was rejected.)  Please suggest an ''actual definition'', not just a discussion that doesn't include an actual definition.  If no actual definitions are proposed, I intend to try again to insert the "author=publisher" definition from WP:USINGSPS.  About that, Whatamidoing thinks WP:USINGSPS is a good place for acceptable/non-acceptable examples of SPS, so if WP:USINGSPS is trustworthy, then it ought to be trustworthy for the definition.  If it's not trustworthy for the definition, then it's not trustworthy for acceptable/unacceptable examples either, and the acceptable/unacceptable examples should be included in this policy. -[[User:Michaelbluejay|MichaelBluejay]] ([[User talk:Michaelbluejay|talk]]) 21:23, 22 July 2020 (UTC)}}

Hi! I'd like to garnish some opinions about exactly what this article is about. The name suggests an exploration of the political landscape of Australia, such as the Labor and Liberal parties, and the power of the crossbench. On the other hand, the current article content explores the system of governance in Australia, with very significant overlaps with [[Australian Government]] in terms of the branches of government. If this article is about politics, then the article probably needs to be rewritten. If this article is about governance, then it needs to be moved to an article title that better reflects this (''{{no redirect|Governance of Australia}}''?), and likely copyedited significantly.

Hi! I'm a bit concerned about the exact scope of this article. Considering that Wikipedia already has significant articles about [[bisexual erasure]] and [[lesbian erasure]], as well as passive mention of [[asexual erasure]], this article has very little in terms of meaningful content, not to mention that it's a stub at best.

Hello, greetings 

At outset itself I do apologize my bit stronger statement, is used to express my displeasure strongly enough. 

Since I came on Wikipedia, I have been observing many '''improvement notice''' hat note templates as examples of 'curator's dilemma'  turned into 'curator extremism' rather than purpose of help and encouragement those seem to have been used frequently for expression of bad faith and threatening. If at all in main space then can be understood to an extent, but even in Draft namespace I come across this 'Template:AFC submission|T'  which is massive and distracting to content contributors, and template page informs is used on 40,000+ pages .        

I am not totally against improvement notice templates but many times those can be saved for limited use. At times I have seen if a curator takes an extra step and help out in writing better an distracting improvement notice can be avoided. Any ways I am not too pleased with size of Template:AFC submission|T

Thanks and best wishes

It also said the Council on Federal Financial Relations will report to National Cabinet.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Morrison|first=Scott|date=29 May 2020|title=Press Conference - Australian Parliament House, ACT|url=https://www.pm.gov.au/media/press-conference-australian-parliament-house-act-29may20|url-status=live|access-date=9 July 2020|website=Prime Minister of Australia}}</ref> In short, it's all a bit of a hodge-podge as to exactly what National Cabinet is... I'm thinking that to kind of reset this article a bit (considering National Cabinet went from being a meeting about COVID to being the central cooperation body for all of Australia), it might be worth creating a {{no redirect|National Federation Reform Council}} article, with sections for '''National Cabinet''', the '''Council on Federal Financial Relations''', and for '''ALGA''' (which will have a {{template|main}} hatnote)?

Policy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Islam-related_articles#Other_persons Islam-related_articles#Other_persons] doesn't specifically deals with honorofics like ''Allama'', ''Maulana'', etc. Do we allow use of honorofic ''Allama'' with the names or not? So policy can be updated @ [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Islam-related articles#Other persons|relevant section of this policy page]] 

Recently the question has been arisen  specifically at an article [[Syed Jawad Naqvi]] where it keeps getting added despite constantly being removed. 

For those who want to know more about term Allama, Wikipedia has an article about term [[Allamah]] 

:For information {{Ping|Faizhaider}} & {{Ping|Sharief123}} being first ones to discuss the issue at the article [[Syed Jawad Naqvi]].

I believe we should create a barnstar for excellence in breaking news editing. What I mean is, when a Wikipedia article or articles is affected by some breaking news changing by the minute or hour, (e.g. the COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess Cruise ship, although that could also be covered in the general COVID article,) high quality editing that keeps a page consistent with the latest verifiable news reports is difficult and intensive work that deserves to be rewarded in this way. This seems to me to be qualitatively different work than that covered by the current events barnstar, which can be used for articles of an evolving but more stable nature, on, say, the current presidential election.

Hi, I came across [[Svoboda (political party)|this article]] recently and noticed some glaring issues with the lede:
* First, this statement "It is positioned between the right-wing and the far-right of the political spectrum. It is widely considered a fascist and/or anti-semitic party" sounds [[WP:WEASEL|weaselly]] to me. We shouldn't be approximating these things, is the party any of those things or isn't it?
* Second, do we need a breakdown of different election results in the lede? Doesn't that kind of detail belong in the body?
* Third, if we include election results, shouldn't they be summarised? 
* Fourth, the prose are really clunky, how can they be improved? 
Thanks in advance. [[User:Bacondrum|Bacondrum]] ([[User talk:Bacondrum|talk]]) 06:03, 19 July 2020 (UTC)}}

I propose a new subsection 3.1.2 titled "Ecclesiastical titles." The content would be as follows:

:If reliable sources consistently use an ecclesiastical title (e.g. Pope, Elder, Patriarch, Sister, Cardinal), then it should be used on Wikipedia as well, at least on the first instance. It may be used on subsequent instances, if reliable sources typically use it (e.g. [[Patriarch Bartholomew]]) or if the context provided is useful. Otherwise, the subject's surname is sufficient and conforms to general encyclopedic style. In some cases, such as to avoid repetition, it may be acceptable to refer to the subject by their title alone in subsequent instances ([[John_O%27Connor_(cardinal)#Relations_with_organized_labor|e.g.]] "A non-union crew from NBC appeared at the cardinal's residence to cover one of O'Connor's press conferences.").

This RfC discussion has been started to allow users to decide between two versions of the infobox. [[Template:Infobox automobile]] already gives a clear guideline about the use of the infobox template. This discussion has been started per this [[WP:AN3]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive402#User%3A1292simon_reported_by_User%3AU1Quattro_%28Result%3A_Both_warned%29 decision].

The relevant diffs are as follows:
*[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BMW_Z3&diff=968366120&oldid=968364715 1292simon's version]
*[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BMW_Z3&diff=968394606&oldid=968366120&diffmode=source U1Quattro's version]

Comments in this regard would be highly appreciated. I would not participate in this RfC due to being involved in this long standing content dispute.

Footnote 9 currently reads, in part (emphasis added):

{{tq2|Sources that may have interests other than professional considerations in the matter being reported are considered to be conflicted sources. '''Further examples of sources with conflicts of interest include but are not limited to articles by any media group that promotes the holding company of the media group or discredits its competitors'''; news reports by journalists having financial interests in the companies being reported or in their competitors; material (including but not limited to news reports, books, articles and other publications) involved in or struck down by litigation in any country, or released by parties involved in litigation against other involved parties, during, before or after the litigation; and promotional material released through media in the form of paid news reports.}}

Recently, there was a discussion at RSN, "Is CNN usable as a source for unflattering information about Fox News?", which closed with "The consensus is that CNN is a usable source for unflattering information about Fox News. Editors largely do not accept the financial COI argument to disqualify CNN." ([[Special:Permalink/968564798#Is CNN usable as a source for unflattering information about Fox News?|permalink]])

It strikes me that it would be amazing if we could get a dedicated, designated team of volunteers to start universal narrating of articles so we can present content in audio format for English language learners and persons with visual and/or learning disabilities (and anyone else who enjoys a good listen!) Screen reader technology is nice, but it lacks inflection, pronunciation, and nuance.   The current project in this vein is a good start but doesn’t quite go far enough in that it requires the user to request recording.

{{rfcquote|text=
Normally, when a series is cancelled or ended, we list the end date as when the final episode was aired/released. But sometimes, a show is taken off the air with no word as to whether it has been renewed or canceled; under current practices, we presume a series to have ended if no new episodes have aired in over a year and it has not been officially renewed. The end date is listed in the infobox and the page is added to the appropriate subcategory of [[Category:Television series endings by year]], but we do not list it on a [[List of years in television|(YEAR) in (COUNTRY) television]] page. (This is not currently mentioned in the MOS. I can't find where the consensus for this rule was decided.)

''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'' last aired a new episode on June 24, 2019 and has not been renewed, so it satisfies the "presumed ending" criteria. (The spinoff miniseries, ''[[Darwin's Yearbook]]'', aired later, but it doesn't count.) However, various users (including myself) have objected to this because the series has also not been confirmed to be canceled. It didn't help that the matter was already controversial from the day the possible finale was announced. Conflict over ''Gumball'''s status is the main reason why the show's article was protected today.

In light of the applicable policies/guidelines, should a series be presumed ended if no new episodes have aired in the past year? If so, which pages should list this presumed end date? –[[User:LaundryPizza03|<b style="color:#77b">Laundry</b><b style="color:#fb0">Pizza</b><b style="color:#b00">03</b>]] ([[User talk:LaundryPizza03|<span style="color:#0d0">d</span>]][[Special:Contribs/LaundryPizza03|<span style="color:#0bf">c̄</span>]]) 08:50, 20 July 2020 (UTC)}}

What is the reliability of the aforementioned report. This is used in the context of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guba_mass_grave]]. Andrey Fomich Novatski is a prosecutor of the Ganja District Court of Azerbaijan. He was commissioned to create this historical report by the Azerbaijani Government under the Foriegn ministry (http://www.milliarxiv.gov.az/en/fovqelade-tehqiqat-komissiyasi), which broadly hoped to raise awareness of Armenian violence. This is within the context of the ongoing Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and territorial claims ([[Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict]], or specifically the speech at Guba [[Anti-Armenian_sentiment_in_Azerbaijan#Statements_by_President_Ilham_Aliyev]]).

I would like to know whether it is reasonable to note the name of the magistrate to an article that mentions that someone has been convicted. Specifically, this is a question about [[WP:ONUS]]. I personally think it is relevant and important context. I think it is good to know who the magistrate is who convicted someone, and it often makes it easier to locate the court case if you know the name of the judicial officer. What are the specific objections to include this material? I can't see how it would be a violation of [[WP:BLP]], and I certainly don't think that the judge is a trivial part of any court case! - [[User:Chris.sherlock|Chris.sherlock]] ([[User talk:Chris.sherlock|talk]]) 06:20, 23 August 2020 (UTC)}}

An editor has been completely removing the label of right-wing from the political position section of the infobox. The claim of right-wing was support by multiple reliable supporting citations that were correctly cited. There was also no consensus on the talk page to completely remove the political position label of right-wing from the infobox. I have actively tried to seek [[WP:COMPROMISE|compromise]] by removing the label of right-wing populist from the opening line. It is also worth noting that on the French language version of the page the party is defined in the infobox as having "catch-all positioning", as well as being "radical right", and "far right", not just simply labelled as only far right.

Consensus above is that the policy should define SPS (which makes sense; a policy about SPS isn't as useful if no guidance is provided as to what SPS is).  Since defining SPS is a significant edit of the policy, it will benefit from having a greater number of editors involved in creating the definition.

Since I am working on Wikipedia, I do not find much editorial presence of women of Muslim background, while Muslim women seem to be active on other social media platforms? 

:1) Is this perception factual or not ? 
:2) If it is true why it is so ?
:5) When I searched this projects talk page archive, I found very few searches for word 'women',  Why would be that so? 
:3) Even if they are less does it matter?
:4) If matters then what could be solutions to improve situation?

Since this project page has very few previous discussions, if discussion continues longer time period will be better. IMHO.

'''Should the subject's birthday be considered a valid reason for a special occasion request?'''

The criteria at [[WP:DYK#Date requests]] says nothing about what a "special occasion" is. Past discussion says that it's up to the reviewer to honor the date request. But nominators are constantly asking us to promote hooks to mark a subject's birthday, or even the birthday of an actor who plays a certain character. It's my understanding that a "special occasion" refers to an anniversary, such as the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, or the annual staging of a sports event, or some other ''significant'' date. [[Beethoven]]'s 250th birthday would obviously meet this criteria. But a random birthday is not significant and we should not be expected to scramble sets to accommodate it.

So, for days we have been arguing over the inclusion of content regarding Anne’s sexuality. As it went on, it became very muddled about what the argument was about. Here is a proper RfC, which should have been done in the first place, with the two things we’re arguing over: 
# Should we include a label on Anne’s sexuality (e.g. bisexual, etc), which then places her in an LGBT category?
# Should we include mention of Anne’s exploration of her sexuality with her friend which was removed and later re-added in a later edition?

According to Aaron Mate writing in [[The Nation]], a few days prior to the release of the interim report, a "US government delegation met with members of the investigation team to try to convince them that the Syrian government had committed a chemical attack with chlorine". The investigation team regarded the meeting as "unacceptable pressure and a violation of the OPCW’s declared principles of independence and impartiality".<ref name="nation240620">{{cite web | url=https://www.thenation.com/article/world/opcw-leaks-syria/ | title=Did Trump Bomb Syria on False Grounds? | publisher=The Nation | date=24 July 2020 | accessdate=26 July 2020 | author=Maté, Aaron}}</ref>

{{rfcquote|text=
 Does the official Linux kernel code that is maintained and  released by Mr. Linus Torvalds infringe the GPLv2 (and derived licenses or dual licensing with MIT)?

From the COPYING file that is located at the root of the Linux tree source code: 

"The Linux Kernel is provided under:

	SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note

Being under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 only,
according with:

	LICENSES/preferred/GPL-2.0

With an explicit syscall exception, as stated at:

	LICENSES/exceptions/Linux-syscall-note

In addition, other licenses may also apply. Please see:

	Documentation/process/license-rules.rst

for more details.

All contributions to the Linux Kernel are subject to this COPYING file."

This morning I had to revert the umpteenth edit of the nth "contributor" that stated that the Linux licensing rules allow developers of proprietary modules to upload binary code (i.e., compiled executable objects) into the official kernel tree. Furthermore, the above mentioned editors write that Mr. Torvalds regularly distributes such executables hidden in his own git branch. This implies that Linus voluntarily breaks the GPLv2, thus making himself the leader of a gang of outlaws  

Contributors should read the entire Linux kernel article, and act with coherence with it. In more than one section of this article is clearly stated that Linux has not "binary blobs", although it is capable to locate and load them from user space. There are authoritative citations supporting it.

Please read https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html

From now on, such disruptive edits will be immediately reverted and editors will be reported for vandalism. [[User:Fabio Maria De Francesco|Fabio Maria De Francesco]] ([[User talk:Fabio Maria De Francesco|talk]]) 13:13, 31 July 2020 (UTC)}}

This article is the subject of a dispute between several users regarding its neutrality. The article appears to rely heavily upon a mix of sources of questionable quality (pop news websites such as Pedestrian.tv and Junkee) as well as many citations linking directly back to the organisation's own website. Sections of the article read more like a brochure rather than a neutral description of the entity. The membership figure is disputed, with no reliable source confirming a '16,000 member' figure with the [https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/clubs-and-fundraising/incorporated-associations/search-for-an-incorporated-association?id=dac3af41-48b7-44d3-86e4-fbbd99eb3e8a Incorporated Associations Register from the State Government of Victoria] showing far less than this. Discussion on the talk page has not been fruitful as the official records from the Victorian Government are being rejected as not credible by single-purpose accounts. Further to this, SPAs have blanked other user comments on the talk page and attempts to place a neutrality template on the article in an effort to promote discussion and improvement of the topic have been reverted. Any outside comment on this matter and the editing activity would be much appreciated for clarification and hopefully resolution.

Many of you will note that the erstwhile [[User:Citation bot]] was blocked about two months ago. After copious discussion, the block has revealed some underlying issues about how we deal with citations, that seem to lack community consensus. The initial block was over Citation bot unlinking sources in reference titles if it was already linked to something like a DOI, or other unique identifier. I thank [[User:Levivich]] for the wording of the questions, whose text I snatched verbatim from [[WP:BOTN]] :) [[User:CaptainEek|<span style="color:#6a1f7f">'''CaptainEek'''</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:CaptainEek|<span style="font-size:82%"><span style="color:#a479e5">''Edits Ho Cap'n!''</span></span>]]</sup>[[Special:Contributions/CaptainEek|⚓]] 20:39, 5 August 2020 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I propose that we '''formally deprecate the <u>inline</u> parenthetical citation style'''.

Wikipedia has [[WP:CITEVAR|long valued different styles of citation]], and we do formally protect a wide range of citation styles. There was even a 2006 ArbCom case that ruled on the issue. However that was 14 years ago, and a lot has changed since then. As Wikipedia moves forward, and our style grows more standardized and formal, I question the utility of the rarely used [[WP:PAREN|parenthetical citation style]]. This style exists because it is used in scientific papers and college essays. However, papers and essays do not have the benefit of being online; thus they cannot have expandable footnotes with fancy coding. Parenthetical citations also clutter the text and make reading more difficult. See for example [[Actuary]], which is one the bare handful of FAs with parenthetical citation style. It includes sentences like {{tq|In various studies, being an actuary was ranked number one or two multiple times since 2010 (Thomas 2012, Weber 2013, CareerCast 2015) and in the top 20 for most of the past decade (CareerCast 2014, CareerCast 2016, CNN Money 2017, CareerCast 2019).}} which is cluttered, and unnecessarily long because of the citations. At the end of the day, our goal is to serve the [[WP:READER]]. The best way we can do that is to provide easy to read articles, free from inline clutter.

{{rfcquote|text=
While some questions are raised at [[Talk:Superstitions in Muslim societies]] about article [[Superstitions in Muslim societies]]  IMHO wider attention, consultation and  consensus is preferable that is why creating RfC here. I could see following points need to be brainstormed.

1) Is word 'superstition'  positive one?, whether  'folk belief' or something similar would be appropriate instead ?

2) Whether same  definition as of main [[Superstition]] article should apply to rest of superstition article or it should be different ?

3) How and what kind of exemptions should be allowed to religious, folk and cultural beliefs to avoid them being covered in superstition related articles. 

4.1) Superstition related article titles  should be Communities oriented, religion oriented 

4.2) for example Superstitions in Muslim societies covers few non-religious superstition among Bangladeshi pregnant women ? Should such coverage be allowed ? Is it leading to [[WP:Coatrack]] issues.

4.3) Alternate name suggestions for Superstitions in Muslim societies are or [[Superstition in the Islamic world]], [[Islamic views of superstition]] Whether such change will be able to accommodate such superstitions not having religious standing but exists in communities as example given above?

4.4) Or another suggestion has come to consider title  [[Superstition in the Muslim world]]?

4.5) When Criticism of Religion related articles do exist whether separate superstition related articles focusing communities or religion are needed at all? 

My personal opinions are obviously different, but I have attempted to be as neutral as possible,  What are your opinions ? Let us brainstorm.

In order to avoid the war of edits, I invite the entire Wikipedia community to discuss such a complex issue. The problem is the following: whether to leave the article on Orthodox Christianity or not. I stand to leave. First, without this article, it is impossible to understand the culture and history of Russia. Secondly, I believe that the Orthodox Christianity article should be separate from the Orthodox Church article, since Orthodox Christianity is not homogeneous, there is no single church, but a common religious tradition. After all, this topic affects millions of people and their culture. Not having an article about Orthodox Christianity would be strange.

In my opinion, the vast majority of the categories in births by year and deaths by year are overpopulated. They have grown so large that they no longer serve their intended purpose, which is so readers can [[WP:CAT|"browse and quickly find sets of pages on topics that are defined by those characteristics"]]. The worst culprit, {{cl|1988 births}}, contains 16,930 articles, spread out over 85 pages. Nobody browses that many pages, let alone finds something quickly on them. The solution is easy: subcategorisation. First by month, then by date, e.g. 1900 births > January 1900 births > January 1, 1900 births. Note that, unlike the categories that have consistently been deleted at [[WP:CFD|CFD]], they refer to an exact date of birth. While in the early days of Wikipedia, it would have constituted overcategorisation, by now it is needed to keep the categories usable. I do realise that this is a monumental task if done manually, but I suppose an editor who is savvy with bots should be able to let a bot do most of the work.

{{rfcquote|text=
I got to the [[Austria-Hungary]] Wiki article some time ago and immediately noticed it displayed a wrong flag - in the place of the "country" flag, a "civil ensign" created for being used by civilian ships. As the article states, the country had no official flag, but the Habsburg flag, which as the article also shows was the official flag of both the [[Kingdom_of_Hungary_(1526–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Austrian Empire]], was frequently used as an official flag. Since there existed no official flag, I believe the article should just not have any flag at all (like in the German wiki). I believe there is absolutely no reason why a naval "civil ensign" should be displayed in the place of the country flag. The exactly same point has apparently been made throughout the years - [[Talk:Austria-Hungary/Archive_1#Flag_of_Austria-Hungary|15 years ago]] there was consensus that it was wrong but after the correction someone re-added the wrong civil ensign without discussion; in 2016, [[Talk:Austria-Hungary/Archive_3|another user]] pointed out the same mistake, and the only response was agreeing with his comment and presenting a historical source in which the black-and-yellow Habsburg flag was used for the country; finally, in 2019, [[Talk:Austria-Hungary/Archive_4#(Controversial?)_change_to_Flag_of_Austria-Hungary|yet another user]] politely indicated that the flag was wrong, only 3 people participated in the discussion which was therefore short of a consensus, but yet another user concluded it was sensible to add the yellow-and-black flag to the article, except that it was removed afterwards by the same user who has removed it twice today. So I think we need the help of some experts here, which would be very much appreciated. Thanks.

''' Responses (wikitia) '''

*'''Option 4''' While the main page of wikitia says {{tq|the encyclopedia where only verified editors who have proven records can edit an article on a particular topic or field}}, this appears to be a load of rubbish. For example see the history of [[Draft:Mohammed Abu El-Naga]]. The [https://wikitia.com/wiki/Mohammed_Abu_El-Naga corresponding article at wikitia] says it was copied from that draft, on 15 June according to the history. But then if you go back to the history of the draft you see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Draft%3AMohammed_Abu_El-Naga&type=revision&diff=966534207&oldid=966508610 this edit] on 7 July adding the wikitia article as a reference, which is as circular as it gets.

 What do you feel about depiction of Women's rights issues in Country name articles?

What do I mean by Country name articles? 
:For example [[USA]] [[France]] [[Russia]] [[China]] to [[Djibouti]] any of [[List of sovereign states|193 UN member states]] 

Many times I browse country name articles just to find what sort of information article gives about status of women in respective countries, and personally I do have reservations the way poorly most of articles cover women rights issues in respective countries. 

:1) Have you visited Wikipedia article page of Your own country, Your country of residence, if different from country of citizenship. Whether article represents Women's rights issue adequately?
:2) If not, then do you feel need of country name articles to cover women's rights issues better.
:3) Or do you opposed to the very idea of Country name articles to cover Women's rights issues in their own countries. If opposed what are the reasons you will push forwards including personal ones like to hide limitations in your country. 
:4) If you are opposed then what are best Wikipedia policies which can shield your country from depiction of Women rights issues and help in soft-censorship. Like of [[WP:BITE|How to bite]],[[WP:COATRACK]],[[WP:CFORK]] suggest more. 
:Please don't be surprised or stressed, Wikipedians are good @ doing that to keep women in good humor. So take all such reasons humorously and easy, if you don't agree with ever eager curators who can throw policy document and interpretations at you with ease :)

Your comments please.

WP:COFAQ#ENGLISH 

CDPR has it's offices in LA. The games' social media and press releases are written in US English. What's the justification for using British English when the thing in US English. In compliance with WP:COFAQ#ENGLISH seeing as the English version of this game is a US topic. 

https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1040189032364306433?s=20

https://twitter.com/cdprojektred/status/1138155714789163008?lang=en

Not to mention the game is in US English. See the subtitles that CDPR put on the new trailer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixl31324UxE&feature=youtu.be&t=81 Jackie says "Asshole" instead of "Aresehole"

The article was also written in US English way back. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyberpunk_2077&diff=729871886&oldid=726941084

Not to mention the game is set in the US. For The Witcher 3's page retaining UK English makes sense because the game is not set in the UK. The first thing we saw of Cyberpunk was "the worst place to live in America" not the worst place to live in England I say the setting and language usage of the game and the should be mirror that of the Wikipedia article. Not to mention Cyberpunk was created by an American about America. Not to mention the game is being touted as a political commentary on.... America. https://www.vg247.com/2020/08/26/cyberpunk-2077-extreme-american-gun-culture/

Navigational sidebars should not be used in the lead.

Technical note: <small>Navigational sidebars are not visible on mobile versions of Wikipedia representing approximately 60 percent of readers. (i.e. [[History of the United States|Desk top]]  vs [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States Mobile version])</small>

Rationale:
The MOS should strongly reject the use of navboxes (sidebars) in the lede.  There are many reasons, such as
*The top right corner should be reserved for an image related to the article's topic.
*Wikilinks are the best way for readers to navigate between aticles.  Few if any readers will want to hop between articles by topic.  Practically none will do so by using the sidebars.
*As a rule, an article belongs to many general topics.  Which one gets to put its sidebar there?
*Editing and inserting sidebars uses a lot of editor brainpower that could be used in more productive ways.
*Sidebars imply a division of knowledge into topics that is at best artificial, at worst misleading and mind-limiting.
*Readers who want to read broadly on articles about a given topic are much better served by a regular article on that topic, that points to specific articles trough wikilinks. The "tab" feature and back" button of most browsers makes it unnecessary to have a sidebar on every article with that topic.
*Sidebars tend to split Wikipedia into a federation topical encyclopedias, each "owned" by a Wikiproject -- which inevitably tends to be dominated by a few editors who create their own rules of style and contents, and are unconsciously hostile to "outsider" editors.
For these and other reasons, the MOS should say "no" to navboxes in the lede. Existing sidebars should be merged into the articles about the respective topics, or, at worst, turned into navbars at the bottom of the article.--[[User:Jorge Stolfi|Jorge Stolfi]] ([[User talk:Jorge Stolfi|talk]]) 23:06, 15 August 2020 (UTC)}}

I want to ask what is the minimum limit for the ''substantial edits'' criteria, because a bad faith editor can add some minor edits, so it does not meet G5. e.g: A banned editor A created a page, and another B added a null edit by appending <code><nowiki><!----></nowiki></code> to the end. Should this page still meet G5? This RfC is for reaching consensus or uniamity about this problem. -- [[User:PythonSwarm|PythonSwarm]]   <sup>[[User talk:PythonSwarm|Talk]]  &#124;   [[Special:Contribs/PythonSwarm|Contribs]]   &#124;   [[Special:CentralAuth/PythonSwarm|Global]]</sup> 10:01, 6 September 2020 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The dispute is whether the text {{u|Ktokolvek5}} wants to include about the 'Czechoslovakia's non-violent defense against the Soviet occupation' is undue according to [[WP:UNDUE]]. My argument is that this article is about the religious and philosophical theories of nonviolence and adding a section about a specific nonviolent campaign as suggested is undue. There are other articles that cover some of the information suggested for inclusion such as [[Non-violent resistance]] and [[Prague Spring]] but I have suggested creating a new article as the best option. {{u|Ktokolvek5}} has reiterated numerous times that it is too important a subject to be included elsewhere. This is I think also against [[WP:NOTADVOCACY]]. I have also commented that the text for inclusion is not up to Wikipedia style standard for an encyclopaedia.

Some users with a conflict of interest or being paid to edit struggle to properly format edit requests. The [[WP:Edit Request Wizard]] handles the formatting automatically, and is supposed to encourage proper wording of requests. Should this tool be mentioned in policy and information pages regarding [[WP:Conflict of interest]] and paid editing? Specifically, I propose linking to it in these pages:
* [[WP:Paid-contribution disclosure#Conflict of interest guideline]],
* in the [[WP:COI]] guideline whenever the {{template|request edit}} template is mentioned,
* in the [[WP:Simple conflict of interest edit request]], and
* on [[WP:Edit requests]].

Comments also welcome on improvements to the wizard itself.

Following on from the discussion started here:

[[Talk:Donald Trump#What happened to the succession boxes?]]

How does the community feel about succession boxes and their inclusion in the articles about US Presidents specifically? The following three options were presented on the talk page above:

# The succession boxes should be included in all U.S. presidents' BLPs.
# The succession boxes should be omitted from all U.S. presidents' BLPs.
# One size does not fit all. Cross-article consistency is less important than flexibility. Decide on a case-by-case basis at article level.

I genuinely believe they help navigation between articles, though they could often be trimmed down to avoid trivial items, and if they are too large, they can be collapsed into the Offices and distinctions box. That way if you are looking for them, they are there, but if not they are not taking up a lot of space at the bottom of the article.

[[File:Chadwick Boseman (28017825484) (cropped 2).jpg|thumb|upright|Option B]]
There have been three discussions and endless edit wars between multiple parties regarding which image to use in the infobox on the [[Chadwick Boseman]] article. The images are included here.

Arguments for option A include being the most recent and best-lit photo. Arguments for option B include that it has no objects in front of the subject.

Since it's evident this issue can't be solved at the article's own talk page, and it primarily relates to creating a biography, I'm opening this RfC to get a wide consensus to stop the edit warring. [[User:Kingsif|Kingsif]] ([[User talk:Kingsif|talk]]) 19:26, 22 September 2020 (UTC)}}

Background: I believe there may be a problem regarding the clarity of the guidelines establishing notability for shopping malls/centers. The two applicable guidelines are WP:GNG and WP:NBUILD. Routine, average coverage that any and every mall will have such as announcements about openings, closings, and events and articles, local promotional articles and articles about land redevelopment after a mall closes are being interpreted as WP:SIGCOV to establish notability. I base this on a number of current and recent AfDs.·

Question: Should existing guidelines be clarified (or a new guideline created) to provide more guidance between what is considered routine ''run of the mill'' coverage and what coverage will establish notability? <span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;[[User:TimothyBlue|Timothy]]&nbsp;::&nbsp;</strong>[[User talk:TimothyBlue|<strong>talk</strong>]]&nbsp;</span> 01:01, 31 August 2020 (UTC)}}

This article should be merged into [[2020 United States racial unrest]] (see also discussions there about changing that article's name). The intention of that article is to provide a broad, overarching summary of the wave of opposition to system racism and support for Black Lives Matter in 2020; this article seems to have a similar focus. I don't think the distance between "''injustice reckoning''", referring more to public awareness and changes, as far as I can tell, and ''unrest'', implying more of a focus on the protests and riots, is sufficient to justify not having one main overarching article that brings everything together. —[[User:Kilopylae|Kilopylae]] ([[User talk:Kilopylae|talk]]) 10:12, 31 August 2020 (UTC)}}

Should the following summary of Chapter 11, which has been contributed but has been repeatedly reverted, be permitted to be published, without further reversions: favor.

If you feel it should continue to be blocked: oppose. 

Chapter 11 is entitled, "Fear of Race and Identity." At the beginning of this chapter Reich describes the hostile reception received by his work on prostate cancer, which showed that the higher rate of prostate cancer previously observed in African American men is largely genetic in origin. In a section of this chapter, entitled "Real Biological Difference" Reich further notes, "an orthodoxy that the biological differences among human populations are so modest that they should be in practice ignored ... ." He then states that the genome revolution is producing results that are "making it impossible to maintain the orthodoxy ... as they are revealing hard evidence of substantial differences across populations." He also observes that "traits shaped by many mutations (as is probably the case for behavior and cognition)" are "targets" of natural selection, just as are traits that are determined by fewer genetic differences, like skin color.{{sfn|Reich|2018}}

{{rfcquote|text=
There is a discussion going on regarding whether or not [[Muhammad Iqbal]] should be labeled an "Indian" in the lead section. 2 Editors have already displayed agreement that it should, however [[User:Idell]], who is a Pakistani national with a manifest and obvious bias towards this topic, disagrees and thinks he wasn’t an Indian, and should rather be identified otherwise. The insistence on his identification as a "British Indian" makes little sense, as the specific type of state that existed at the time makes little difference to the national identity as "Indian", an identity which has existed for millennia. Furthermore, there is specific and explicit self-identification by the individual in question himself, which utilises "Indian", nothing more or less: 
“'''Rumi is Sir Muhammad Iqbal’s great master ... he names himself as Mureed-i-Hindi (the Indian disciple)"''' {{cite web |last= Said |first= Farida |title= REVIEWS: The Rumi craze |url= http://www.dawn.com/weekly/books/archive/050508/books18.htm |accessdate= 2007-05-19 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220804/http://www.dawn.com/weekly/books/archive/050508/books18.htm |archive-date= 2007-09-27}}. 
It is evident that bias caused by nationalism is causing the display of post hoc fallacies on a public encyclopedia which is supposed to embody freedom of information and bias-free impartiality. [[User:شاه عباس|شاه عباس]] ([[User talk:شاه عباس|talk]]) 11:47, 4 September 2020 (UTC)}}

While some questions are raised at [[Talk:Superstitions in Muslim societies]] about article [[Superstitions in Muslim societies]]  IMHO wider attention, consultation and  consensus is preferable that is why created RfC [[Talk:Superstition#RfC Superstitions in Muslim societies related questions]] that sounds logical to me, but some seem to expect Rfc at this page. So I am retaining that Rfc there and adding separate RfC to this talk page too.    


I could see following points need to be brainstormed.

1) Is word 'superstition'  positive one?, whether  'folk belief' or something similar would be appropriate instead ?

2) Whether same  definition as of main [[Superstition]] article should apply to rest of superstition article or it should be different ?

3) How and what kind of exemptions should be allowed to religious, folk and cultural beliefs to avoid them being covered in superstition related articles. 

4.1) Superstition related article titles  should be Communities oriented, religion oriented 

4.2) for example Superstitions in Muslim societies covers few non-religious superstition among Bangladeshi pregnant women ? Should such coverage be allowed ? Is it leading to [[WP:Coatrack]] issues.

4.3) Alternate name suggestions for Superstitions in Muslim societies are or [[Superstition in the Islamic world]], [[Islamic views of superstition]] Whether such change will be able to accommodate such superstitions not having religious standing but exists in communities as example given above?

4.4) Or another suggestion has come to consider title  [[Superstition in the Muslim world]]?

4.5) When Criticism of Religion related articles do exist whether separate superstition related articles focusing communities or religion are needed at all? 

My personal opinions are obviously different, but I have attempted to be as neutral as possible,  What are your opinions ? Let us brainstorm.

There has been some discussion about how to create/maintain articles on [[civil parishes]] in England. There has been discussion on having a bot create the articles but this hasn't yet been done due to not having the code or consensus (generating a code for this is needed so if anyone can that would be appreciated). Although this RFC is mainly aimed at page creation it does also talk about how the data can be added/maintained to existing articles. Previous discussions at [[Wikipedia:Bot requests#Civil parish bot]], [[Wikipedia:Bot requests/Archive 79#Civil parish bot]] and [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 160#Civil parish bot]]. The 1st, 2nd and 3 (which will probably simply be "no") questions relate to civil parishes, namely their creation/maintenance and if they should be split or merged. The 4th and 5th aren't that relevant here but are related to how to handle other places and their notability so answering these questions isn't so important but please feel free to try to answer then to. Note that I have removed NOMIS due to that fact that its boundaries shown seem to be inaccurate but if you look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Crouch,_Swale/England&diff=981523679&oldid=945551994#Civil_parishes this] version you can see the boundaries since it the maps are better than City Population De's.

A brief introduction:

After [[Talk:Bryn_Eglwys_quarry#Requested_move_4_January_2020|a move discussion in early January (2020)]] on [[Talk:Bryn Eglwys]], a mass-move of [[:Category:Slate mines in Wales|all slate quarries in Wales]] was performed, by {{u|The Mirror Cracked}}, who was a major editor of these pages [[User Talk:The Mirror Cracked#Don't Go|but has unfortunately recently gone missing]]. This move retitled the pages from assorted '...Quarry's, '...Slate Quarry's, and '...quarry's, to a standard '...quarry'.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should independent groups of people be listed as an endorsement? I’ll elaborate: As per section 2 of [[WP:ENDORSEMENTS]], “Lists of endorsements should only include endorsements which have been covered by reliable independent sources.” On occasion, a website will pop up such as The Lincoln Project or national security officials for Biden which list people who have signed on as endorsements. These are not independent sources, but they are covered by independent sources. As a hypothetical example, the New York Times might report that a new group called we endorse Biden popped up announcing 120 new endorsements. The NYT doesn’t list all of the endorsees because the list is too long, they may name a few or none at all. In this case, should these names be added? Should they be referenced to the NYT article or the website of 120 new endorsements or both? As you can see, independent sources cover the endorsement, but they do not list all of the names. Just to clarify, I am not referring to anything referring to social media, so this rfc is not about “Twitter is reliable” or “Youtube is not reliable”, only official organizations or websites.

No idea under which RfC category to put this under, sorry if it's wrong.

The phrase "You still live in your mother's [[basement]] at the age of 30+." was recently removed from Level V by {{Reply to|Usernamekiran}}, calling it "neither logical, relevant, nor funny".

{{rfcquote|text=
Over time various people (presumably mostly new users) have proposed to add a list of titled arena winners to this page, with experienced users rolling back and undoing these edits, marking them as promotional content and primary-source only. An RfC was then held in March 2020 and closed after two members added their opinions, voting against adding such a list.

As stated above, even if the consensus remains that such events are not suitable for Wikipedia, I believe it is inconsistent to then allow for pages such as [[2017 Speed Chess Championship]] and [[2018 Speed Chess Championship]] to exist, with the former having 24 references out of which 24 are to Chess.com, and the latter having 25 out of which 23 are to Chess.com. So I believe the discussion should be reopened, if only to address this inconsistency.

As for the point raised in the previous RfC that this table would double the page length, again this equivalently applies to e.g. [[2018 Speed Chess Championship]], which is significantly longer than [[Chess.com]].

Regarding external references, as mentioned in [[Lichess]] a.o. Forbes, Slate, and Der Spiegel have previously made note of the titled arenas and Carlsen's performance in these events, which suggests there is more interest in these results besides the Lichess community.

{{rfcquote|text=
 Lately, I have been arguing with editors, {{u|Joker0002710}} and {{u|Mattia332}}, over whether Nicholas II should be characterized as a "good ruler" in the lead. In light of the sources I've cited as well as the overwhelming evidence set forth in the article, it is my position that such a description is a [[Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Due_and_undue_weight|minority viewpoint]] which should not be used to sum up assessments of his reign recently made after the Soviet Union's fall. If the consensus among Wikipedia's Community is that this view should be included, I'll yield the argument. However, it seems very inappropriate to do so given the existing consensus on Nicholas's reign. [[User:Emiya1980|Emiya1980]] ([[User talk:Emiya1980|talk]]) 22:47, 16 September 2020 (UTC)}}

This was stated before, it is an update after 2 months, there has not been any protest relating to George Floyd since August, no [[WP:V]] that is ongoing and people are mixing up the protests relating to the [[Killing of George Floyd]] with other [[Black Lives Matter]] protests which have been going on for decades and protests relating to the 2020 election. It is not an official war like the [[American Civil War]] that there has to be a declaration the protests are over, but like the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] which was over when no further incidents of protests were reported. There are no reports or [[WP:RS]] that the George Floyd protests are still ongoing, thus it must be referred to as an event of the past. This was the last reported George Floyd protest incident on August 3rd [https://www.koin.com/news/protests/live-blog-night-65-of-protests-in-portland/]. While the George Floyd protests may not be ongoing anymore, protests relating to other issues of racism and police brutality may be included in other [[Black Lives Matter]] movement articles.

Should ice dancer biographies have "combined" team pages for significant pairings?

I have noticed that many ice dancers have individual pages that are essentially [[WP:REDUNDANTFORK]]s of each other - for example, mentioning the same information about ice dance seasons and their competition results. I noticed that there is an article for [[Torvill and Dean]], but I do not know if this is a good "precedent" of a combined team page that can be followed.

As may be read on above talk, a few controversial edits has been introduced. Peer reviewed RS refer to the two official 1930 Romanian and 1941 Hungarian censuses and posit near equal the possible Romanian and Hungarian population in [[Northern Transylvania]], without taking sides. A user removed the ''significant Romanian population'' and took sides, claiming ''significant'' would not be neutral, at the same time added the Hitchins quote copied from the earlier mentioned article, which is exactly reflecting the neutral approach based on the two censuses,  not taking sides. Is really ''significant'' not an appropriate description? Or should be write instead ''near equal number of Romanians and Hungarians''? Or we should just refer it like in the Hungary in World War II article like ''a total population of 2,578,100 divided more or less evenly between Hungarians and Romanians (depending on the census, cf.

The next day, {{u|MarnetteD}} moved my request from [[#Edit request]] to [[#New parameter|#New parameter (then "New field")]] and finally she '''opposed''' the parameter, then I replied her to '''support''' per [[#Oppose removal]] by {{u|ProcrastinatingReader}}.

Hi all, 

As several commentators rightfully noted, the article had issues with unbalanced writing and lack of sources. After I disclosed my affiliation with the subject of the article, I heavily added it and layered many sources. I was hoping somebody could go over it with and as an unbiased individual tell me what sources are missing and give me feedback on whether the articles still reads as too PR. I appreciate the community and look forward to working together.

Best,

While I am not asking for the removal of Hindutva fascism. I want to imply that there should be a text-attribution for Prabhat Patnaik which quotes the statement correctly. Text-attribution "According to Marxist Economist Prabhat Patnaik" is highly required here before his quote.   
Wikipedia do not have a policy which restrict marxists to comment on Right wind issue, while I wholeheartedly agree on that, [[WP:BIASED]] states, "Common sources of bias include political..."
Hence, seeing the bias and considering the policy [[WP:BIASED]], A rephrased statement starting with ''According to Marxist Economist Prabhat Patnaik'' would be beneficial. Thank you. [[User:Jenos450|Jenos450]] ([[User talk:Jenos450|talk]]) 16:31, 24 October 2020 (UTC)}}

Interviews are considered primary sources, and we don't rely on primary sources for our facts. That is clear. However, there seems to be a degree of confusion when it comes to use of interviews to establish notability. It is a bit surprising that interviews have not been adequately dealt with in WP policy. My own view is that the principle of [[WP:OR]] applies to factual information, not notability. [[WP:COMMON|Common sense]] dictates that the fact that a subject has an interview published in a major [[WP:RS]]/[[WP:IS]] makes them notable (i.e. counts towards [[WP:SIGCOV]] requirement), same as a profile would. But should we take every piece of information provided in the interview as fact? Of course not!

I request input from other editors on this sentence in the lead: {{tqq|Christianity also enjoys dominant group privilege in the US and some other Western societies.}}  Although it's in the lead, it is not a summary of anything, as there is no discussion of it anywhere in the text. It claims one point of view, making a statement in Wikipedia's voice, without mentioning other viewpoints, and most importantly without defining what "dominant" or "group privilege" mean or refer to. And it is unattributed. 

Perhaps a discussion of what the sources say on this should be in the text somewhere, perhaps under current situation, but imo, it should most definitely include a discussion of what these terms mean with regard to religion, (not race or social class), in sociology, and psychology, and with some reference to how these terms are used on a practical basis in research by PEW and other sources like them.

Then there would need to be some explanation of what impact this has on persecution, since that is allegedly what this page is about. [[User:Jenhawk777|Jenhawk777]] ([[User talk:Jenhawk777|talk]]) 06:14, 28 October 2020 (UTC)}}

How about admirably focused group?". United States Department of State describes MEK in a 2008 report as "cult-like terrorist organisation". Iraq's ambassador to the U.S., Samir Sumaidaie, said in 2011 that the MEK was "nothing more than a cult". Some academics, including Ervand Abrahamian, Stephanie Cronin, Wilfried Buchta, Eli Clifton and others have also made similar claims. Former French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal criticized the MEK for having a "cult nature"; while Former French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said that he was "ashamed" by this statement.|}}

{{tq|A report commissioned by the US government, based on interviews within Camp Ashraf, concluded that the MEK had "many of the typical characteristics of a cult, such as authoritarian control, confiscation of assets, sexual control (including mandatory divorce and celibacy), emotional isolation, forced labour, sleep deprivation, physical abuse and limited exit options". In 2003 Elizabeth Rubin referred to the MEK as "Cult of Rajavi".|}} [[User:Stefka Bulgaria|Stefka Bulgaria]] ([[User talk:Stefka Bulgaria|talk]]) 10:38, 2 October 2020 (UTC)}}

What is the nature of the relationship to [[occupational burnout]] to [[depression]]?

Older research suggests that they are separate entities. Newer research suggests that there is substantial overlap. One key to this controversy is the problem of comparing scores on BO scales like exhaustion to the presence/absence of a depression diagnosis. That kind of comparison is problematic because any relation between a continuous factor like BO's exhaustion to a binary entity like depression present/absent will have a smaller correlation than the relation between two continuous factors.

Recent research on psychopathology (cited in the latest version of the occupational BO article) indicates that depression is better conceptualized as a dimension (on a continuum) than as a taxon. The latest, most methodologically advanced research (also cited in the article), which treats BO and depression as continuous entities, reveals very high correlations, r >= 0.80. In the social sciences, correlations that high suggest that the two measures involved reflect the same underlying entity. In addition, methodologically advanced research that relies on structural equation modeling bifactor analysis, which takes a granular look at the items in BO and depression scales, suggests the BO's exhaustion items and depression items reflect the same entity.

Quicklink for reference: [[Tropical Storm Arthur (2020)]]

I am making this section in response to the suggestion above. I encourage editors to read my objections before making a quick judgement by looks or current article size alone.

*The entire "Meteorological history" section of the article uses a single primary source ([[WP:PRIMARY]]). The formation and events surrounding any given tropical system are considered to be routine unless something is unusual in the way they form or develop.
*Damage was limited in the Caribbean according to the sources used.
*"Although Arthur never directly impacted Florida as a tropical system, the precursor system to Arthur caused heavy rainfall and gusty winds in the Florida Keys and South Florida throughout May 13-14. Over 4 in (101.6 mm) of rain fell in many sections of the Middle Keys and a peak rainfall total of 5.35 in (135.8 mm) fell in Marathon on May 14, where it was the tenth highest rainfall amount for the city on record and second most for May." This is a bit of a stretch... if the sources are not directly blaming the rainfall on Arthur then it could be seen as [[WP:SYNTH]].
*The rest of the impacts section is full of [[WP:ROUTINE]] news reports about rainfall during a tropical system. When tropical systems hit, there is going to be rainfall and flooding. Nothing unusual or [[WP:LASTING]] about that unless it is noted otherwise. 
 
So in conclusion... I do not think Arthur needs an article. The information can be condensed into a summary that does not go into run of the mill detailed information. - [[User:Knowledgekid87|Knowledgekid87]] ([[User talk:Knowledgekid87|talk]]) 18:27, 12 October 2020 (UTC)}}

{Logic statement, ignoring WIKI policy and sorry for any people pinged}  
*Background
So let me drop a quick logic statement.  Wikipedia is supposed to remain unbiased in articles.  So in the opening statement, the article has "The Biden-Ukraine conspiracy theory is a series of false allegations".  I undid the word false as the FBI still has the computer.  {{u|Valjean}} undid my revision with the comment "Follow the RS in the body (IOW, pretty much NEVER revert content with such an editorial note without extensive discussion first). This article isn't just about the last New York Post matter."  So I read the body section.

Now let me give some logic.  About 90% (maybe 100%) of the sources in the Background section are liberal sources (In general, Go Biden, Boo Trump...Those sources).  Logically, they would all say "FALSE!" to any comments about a democrat/liberal, because those are the people they support.  For example, CNN just after the allegations (NY post talk) came out, immediately started saying they were false and then never reported it.  Fox News (Using Logic, ignoring WIKI RS policies) is running with the story.  HOWEVER, Fox News and the majority of non-liberal sources, are leaving the fact in that they might be true.  Knowing how Wikipedia is supposed to be unbiased, should the body have some conservative sources?  {LOGIC Statement:  If you want to know why Wikipedia is saying 'False' to the allegations, it is because the article only has liberal sources, which say 'false'.} (Current Event WikiProject Coordinator) [[User:Elijahandskip|Elijahandskip]] ([[User talk:Elijahandskip|talk]]) 16:14, 16 October 2020 (UTC)}}

It is common practice to abbreviate reference column titles to keep their width narrow. However, even among featured lists, I've noticed considerable variation in format, e.g. [[List_of_accolades_received_by_Her_(film)#Accolades|1]]{{nbsp}}[[List_of_World_Heritage_in_Danger#Currently listed sites|2]]{{nbsp}}[[List_of_Hot_C%26W_Sides_number_ones_of_1961#Chart history|3]]{{nbsp}}[[List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Alicia_Vikander#Awards_and_nominations|4]]{{nbsp}}[[Hawthorn_Memorial_Trophy#List_of_winners|5]]. This RfC seeks to find agreement on the best format for these titles, which could then be added to this guideline or encoded in a template. Here are a bunch of options:
{{div col}}

Should citation tools be allowed?

Background:
* [[Wikipedia:Citing sources#Citation templates and tools]]
* [[Help:Citation tools]]
* [[:Category:Wikipedia citation/link tools]]
Currently, tools such as [[Wikipedia:AutoEd|AutoEd]], [[Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser|AutoWikiBrowser]] and [[User:Kaniivel/Reference Organizer|Reference Organizer]] may be used to make changes to citation styles on individual pages.

(This is about using such tools on single pages and carefully checking the results before publishing. Using such tools on many pages in an automated fashion is far more controversial and would require a separate discussion.)

{{userlinks|Lithopsian}} has decided that edits made with such tools should not be allowed[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kaniivel/Reference_Organizer&diff=prev&oldid=988216459] and has started reverting them.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eta_Carinae&diff=prev&oldid=988211071][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eta_Carinae&diff=prev&oldid=988215534]

:'''Proposed: citation tools may be used on individual Wikipedia articles. The person using the tool should preview the page and carefully check the results before publishing. Such edits should not be reverted unless they introduce errors, and in particular should not be reverted simply because someone does not like the resulting citation style.'''

The argument has been presented that the repackaged album has its own, separate promotional period, and that the Track Listing can circumvent potential confusion around the single not belonging to the original album.

:It is time to reopen discussion in order to achieve consensus to merge these two articles covering one singular topic. But first I would like to address an elephant in the room. There are '''far too many''' Catholic sex abuse articles to manage right now. There is a ton of overlap, just peruse [[:Category:Catholic Church sexual abuse scandals]] and try to visualize the proliferation of articles that all cover topics in a large, crowded, Venn diagram. Here's what happens. There are several IPs who are quite reliable and diligent at adding information to articles like this. When they add a case, it goes in 2-3 disparate articles, identical text. Then someone else like me comes in to edit it. Why should I be forced to edit 3 articles which contain identical information? We invented transclusion for a specific reason. These articles need to be overhauled so that (a) the topics do not overlap so much and (b) duplicated prose is maintained in one and only one central location.
:Now, back to the merge. There is no reason to retain the moribund article [[Catholic Church abuse cases]].

Ok, right. In association with the debate on splitting [[Crusades]] there is a related question on what the article or articles should be called and related to that what the content of each should be. Academics working in the crusades constantly argue between themselves over this and sometimes even argue against their own positions. This has issues of both depth and width of content. This article cannot cover the subject at an appropriate depth while also covering the bredth. A summary article has the challenge of inappropriate emphasis being given to topics only included in order to cover the bredth of the subject. It is unlikely that these issues could be resolved in a major tome let alone a single article on WP.

This requires a pragmatic solution. There is no summary article for the Crusades in the Levant/Near East. Although there are summary articles that have been in turn summarised here e.g. the C-Class [[Northern Crusades]] and [[Reconquista]]. This is in effect that article. But in being that article, some peoples' view of what the full bredth of the subject is cannot be covered here, the wider geographies and periods, the theories, politics, historiograhies, criticisms & ideologies. Neither would the average anglophone lay reader expect them to be covered. They would expect Muslims v Christians, Medieval warriors fighting in the Holy Land. Once they found it, they might feel inclined to make the academic journey and end up with Riley-Smith's near millenia of crusading through to the 19th{{nbsp}}century.

Comment is welcome on two questions:

'''* 1) What should this article be called?'''

'''* 2) What should any split articles be called?'''

To answer these two questions feedback on the scope of 1) and any other split articles would also be helpful.[[User:Norfolkbigfish|Norfolkbigfish]] ([[User talk:Norfolkbigfish|talk]]) 09:24, 19 October 2020 (UTC)}}

== CounterPunch, Other98, and People's Democracy [by CPI(M)] on Left, and The Daily Wire, Blaze Media and Rebel News on the Right '''

These sources have consistently faulted on political news. While doing any academic writing, I had to cross check them with at least one more independent publication. My bottom line is based on the Daily Mail and The Sun. As to source progressive or conservative views, the mainstream outlets give ample voice to both sides on that note. I move the request to deprecate these sources for at least political news. {{small|1=<span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:2402:3a80:a87:34bd:1dd8:9588:6b:8c73|2402:3a80:a87:34bd:1dd8:9588:6b:8c73]] ([[User talk:2402:3a80:a87:34bd:1dd8:9588:6b:8c73#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/2402:3a80:a87:34bd:1dd8:9588:6b:8c73|contribs]]) </span>}}
: As far as I can tell, ''Other98'' and ''People's Democracy'' have never been discussed on RSN, and so are not eligible for an RfC. The other sources have already been discussed a fair bit, and deprecation never came up. In any case, deprecation for only one domain seems rather odd. If a source needs to be deprecated, it probably needs to be generally deprecated. 
: This suggestion seems overly broad and doesn't engage at all with past discussions/policy. For these reasons, I do not think engaging with this would yield useful results. Perhaps you could focus on a specific source and bring up specific reasons for changed status or discussion? [[User:Jlevi|Jlevi]] ([[User talk:Jlevi|talk]]) 12:16, 19 November 2020 (UTC)}}

I hate to say this, but I believe us calculating ACE is a violation of [[WP:OR]]. This isn't simple mathematics by any means. It involves squaring, dividing, and adding together numbers hundreds of times. If you take a look at some of the published sources such as [http://tropical.atmos.colostate.edu/Realtime/index.php?arch&loc=northatlantic Colorado State], there are differences in multiple years. Some differences are as small as 0.1 units and others as large as 2-3 units. We should be using established sources for calculations like this rather than performing our own. Our numbers for the current seasons are actually off from what is listed for their real-time stats. I just don't think we should be using our own calcs when professionals say something else.

{{rfcquote|text=
A discussion on whether illicit trade and black market are duplicate or distinct topics was started a few weeks ago after an editor replaced the article on illicit trade with a redirect to black market. The latest version of the illicit trade article before it was set to a redirect can be found at: {{oldid|Illicit_trade|974366109|permalink}}. I asked for help at two relevant wikiprojects (WP:crime and WP:Organized_Crime). After a few weeks without new input, the discussion appears stalled.

Earlier discussions related to this merge can be found at [[User_talk:MrOllie/Archive_11#Redirecting_illicit_trade_to_black_market]] and [[Talk:Black_market#Recent redirect from duplicate topic]]

Note that  I am the initiator of the illicit trade article and I have a close connexion with the topic. [[User:Factfox|Factfox]] ([[User talk:Factfox|talk]]) 10:29, 25 October 2020 (UTC)}}

Is the category "American Conspiracy Theorists" appropriate for this article?

Statement by filer: I believe that it is, as sources such as the New York Times report on a number of conspiracy theories that Charlie Kirk either originated or propagates. However, Dr. Swag Lord above insists that it is "libelous". I find that argument to be hyperbolic but I think review from a wider audience is appropriate as Swag Lord has already edit-warred against another editor and does not accept the argument regarding the sourcing above.

I would like to see more input about the lenghty presence of the Near Death Experiences section. I think it might be breaking the Neutral Point of View as, at least on its current phrasing seems to endorse that NDE are evidence that the Bahai believes in the after life are true. NDE experiences are a very subjective and controversial topic; practically all religions see them as "evidence" of their belief system and people of different religions generally have NDE that coincidentally correspond to their respective belief (Christians report angels and Jesus or hell with fire and devils, for example). Thus its presence on an article about one particular religion might be over-reaching, but I would like to see other people's opinions. --[[User:Dereck Camacho|Dereck Camacho]] ([[User talk:Dereck Camacho|talk]]) 14:07, 27 October 2020 (UTC)}}

What does the ideal first sentence of "History of X" articles look like? 

MOS:LEADSENTENCE requires a statement of "what, or who, the subject is", which is not easy to apply to these articles. Across the project it is interpreted in different ways, such as:

# Stating how broad the history is (e.g. [[History of Slavery]], [[History of saffron]])
# Stating when the history started (e.g. [[History of the United States]], [[History of Baltimore City College]])
# Stating what X is (e.g. [[History of Gillingham F.C.]] or [[History of the British farthing]])
# Stating X's notability (e.g. [[History of the Wales national football team (1876–1976)]] or [[History of Israel]])

I have created new versions of these templates in {{tl|merge/sandbox}} and {{tl|split/sandbox}} which are more similar to each other. Both of these templates have additional reason parameters. Additionally, the new split template is suitable for other namespaces. I tried to avoid making breaking changes, but it is not guaranteed. Also, some related templates may need to be modified.

"Opposition to the word" and "Slur debate" contain many quotes attributed to individuals, mostly opposing the word that the page is about.

Some of the editors on this talk page believe that there are several problems with these two sections (described below for the sake of keeping the RFC description as neutral as possible).

So, I noticed something. When we go to landfalls of any category(lets just take [[List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes]]), we don't see Chesapeake bay landfalls. Just like we count [[Long Island Sound]] landfalls, I believe we should count storms that make a landfall in the Chesepeake Bay. 

Now, some people may be opposed to this, because what if reliable sources don't say it's a direct landfall. Hmm. Then I am personally a bit more neutral. Still, if we count tiny bodies of water as landfalls, we should definitely count this big of a bay. --[[User:HurricaneTracker495|HurricaneTracker495]] ([[User talk:HurricaneTracker495|talk]]) 21:20, 1 December 2020 (UTC)}}

It’s such a shame it has to come to a now formal process but {{xt|reasonable people can disagree with [me].}} It’s absolute revisionism to say that a identity that did not publicly exist until 13 years later supercedes what is on the official poster and who was nominated for all those awards.  It’s revisionism to say Juno, a pregnant teenage girl, was then played by a transgender actor. It would’ve been an astronimically bigger controversy than even the alleged, so-called “anti-choice”-ness of the film and the lackadaisical attitude toward teenage pregnancy. Page wasn’t even publicly gay in 2007. Publicly, Page was a cisgender woman. That’s as important to the film as it was to her own biographical background. Elliot Page did not portray Juno MacGuff just as the [[Prince_(musician)#1991–1996:_Name_change,_Diamonds_and_Pearls,_and_Chaos_and_Disorder|Love Symbol #2]] didn’t create ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'' and John ''Ono'' Lennon didn’t co-write ''[[A Hard Day's Night]]''. My edit wasn’t even that egregious. There was no so-called “consensus” for making all links Elliot Page or addressing the pronouns, as the talk page above me shows a sea of questions. Too many news reports, including by CNN and the ''New York Times'', about Page’s transition preface with the context of Juno.

'''Question:''' Must a school be notable to be included on a country-wide or region-wide list of schools, specifically in Africa? A '''yes''' vote would require any school on a list to be notable or at least referenced inline, a '''no''' vote would maintain the status quo, which I believe would allow any verifiable school to be included in the list as long as there is a link to verify the school somewhere on the page, such as to a government website with a list of schools.
'''Issue:''' Adamant1 has been removing massive amounts of information from African school lists on the grounds the list entries are "not notable" and changing the list inclusion criteria from "list of schools in (country)" to "list of notable schools in (country)." Sometimes the removed information is clearly verifiable (see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_universities_in_Algeria&type=revision&diff=987645139&oldid=987644715]). Sometimes the removed information is in a very poorly sourced list and slightly less problematic since you can't clearly verify the schools from the provided references (see [[List of schools in Rivers State]]). And sometimes the removed information doesn't contain inline references is easily verified using sources provided in the article, which has led to a functional stalemate over at [[Talk:List of schools in Namibia#Inclusion criteria]], and has led to Adamant1 continuing to remove lots of information from African school lists unabated. I am starting this RfC to determine whether we want to change these lists from being a list of every verifiable school to only properly referenced schools in order to break the stalemate.

== Ancient Persia: Modern-Day Iran or Ancient Iran '''

I noticed {{ping|Laval}}  has undone my edit regarding Ancient Persia meaning ancient Iran. I would like to know on what basis ancient Persia means modern-day Iran and not ancient Iran? Is Roman Empire's heritage also exclusively Italian? Don't Spain, Romania or France 
have anything to do with ancient Rome? 
If a = b, then ax = bx. This isn't even a controversial thing. It's logic. Persia is Iran, therefore ancient Persia is ancient Iran. Ancient Persia was at least twice the size of modern Persia. Can one say that Kurds in the current geography of Iran drank ayran 1500 years ago but those that are now in Iraq or Turkey didn't? If in an imaginary situation the three Khorasan provinces in modern-day Iran join Afghanistan, will they be striped off of their ayran drinking past in ancient times?

Multiple issues have been raised on the talk page by the subject of this [[WP:BLP|BLP]] article, which I will attempt to summarize here:]
* Should the text "{{tq|She has been described as alt-right and a white nationalist.}}" be included in the first paragraph of the lede?
* Should the text "{{tq|Southern is known for her promotion of the Great Replacement conspiracy theory [...] and is credited with helping to popularize the white supremacist conspiracy theory}}" be in the second paragraph of the lede?
There are sure to be additional disagreements, but these are the specific ones that have been brought up. Since this has become the subject of [https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1330382599529918471 Poasts] on twitter, I think the issue may benefit from broader community engagement.

{{rfcquote|text=
I have been informed (as a formal warning threatening an editing block, see my talk page) that "it is unacceptable to dump large amounts of  inappropriate genealogical detail into articles, yet you continue to do so, as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Walter_de_Lacy_(died_1085)&diff=988422837&oldid=974423858 here] a few days ago in [[Walter de Lacy (died 1085)]] where you have been reverted: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Walter_de_Lacy_(died_1085)&diff=988828327&oldid=988638649] by Ealdgyth". 

I'm totally bemused. I actually reduced genealogical information by demoting to a note the sentence "A niece was married to Ansfrid de Cormeilles", which I felt was irrelevent, especially as we were not told who "Ansfrid de Cormeilles" is, and there was no link. So prima facie it's not notable. All I did was to rearrange the existing genealogical information into the standard wikipedia format of bullet points for issue/children (is that disallowed?), adding the date of death for the eldest son and heir, and stating that he was the eldest son and heir (is that disallowed?). That's four words, and not "inappropriate", surely entirely relevant. As is standard in thousands of wikipedia biographies. How is that possibly interpreted as "dumping large amounts of  inappropriate genealogical detail"? The section heading "Family and death" is clearly totally absurd, if not comical, what has "family" got to do with "death"? The two topics are unrelated, so I split them into two logical categories. "Family" can mean either birth/ancestry or marriage/descent. Thus "Marriage and issue" is a clearer heading. Please can we have some comments as to whether my two edits are evidence of what I have been accused of doing.[[User:Lobsterthermidor|Lobsterthermidor]] ([[User talk:Lobsterthermidor|talk]]) 13:50, 23 November 2020 (UTC)}}

Please can we have some further comment as to whether Devonshire [[county historian]]s [[Tristram Risdon]] (d.1640) and [[William Pole (antiquary)|Sir William Pole]] (d.1635) are acceptable sources (or even acceptable primary sources) for use on wikipedia, under the guideline [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources]]. In addition, are [[county historian]]s in general acceptable sources for wikipedia? Is it OK to quote from Tristram Risdon in the form "Risdon (d.1640) stated that xyz"? I feel this is an important issue to get a wider ruling on as it could have significant consequences (and set a significantly restrictive precedent) for wikipedia's articles on local history, as English local history relies largely on what the county historians (working generally 17-18th centuries) recorded, observed and opined about, usually without them giving any sources. Effectively they are primary sources in many areas. I have received a formal warning of a block for quoting from Risdon as "own original research into ancient and unreliable sources".

For multiple years there's been a dispute over the size of the article's bibliography. A RfC done months back didn't seem to generate much input beyond those already involved in the dispute, hence this new request. My argument boils down to believing [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grover_Furr&diff=960939169&oldid=960644832#Bibliography my proposed bibliography] is not inordinately long nor against Wikipedia's rules.

I propose changing the first paragraph ''from'': '''Suicidal ideation''' (or '''suicidal thoughts''') is thinking about [[suicide]] with deliberate consideration or planning. Suicidal ideation is not a diagnosis, but is rather a symptom of many mental disorders. 

''to'': '''Suicidal ideation''' means thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior, although this definition is not universal. For example, the American Psychiatric Association defines suicidal ideation as "thinking about [[suicide]] with deliberate consideration or planning." Suicidal ideation is not a diagnosis, but is rather a symptom of many mental disorders. // Submitted for your consideration by <span style="font-family: Papyrus; font-size: 14px;">[[User:Markworthen|Mark D Worthen PsyD]] [[User talk:Markworthen|(talk)]] [he/his/him]</span> 15:51, 28 November 2020 (UTC)}}

I propose that [[WP:NFOOTY]] be amended as follows to require that players to have been in three competitive games instead of just one:

{{tq|Players who have played, and managers who have managed, in <u>any three</u> competitive game<u>s</u> between two teams from fully professional leagues will generally be regarded as notable.}}

*'''Support''' As proposer. Howdy hello folks. I think I am not alone in bemoaning the "one match standard" of NFOOTY. Right now we grant notability to any player that has even touched the field in a professional match, if even for a few seconds. I think it is high time we raise this standard. For GNG, we often want at least three sources to show notability. I propose that for NFOOTY, we follow a similar path: require that a player has played at least three professional games. I do not think this will singlehandedly solve the issue of sports notability. But I think it is a start. This will at least eliminate the players who have only been in a single match, such as one game subs/loaners. Such players are highly unlikely to have had GNG level coverage. But if you have played in several games, you are much more likely to be a regular member of the team and to have received GNG coverage.

Bihari Rajput rebels of 1857, as the page contains history of Bihari Rajputs too. Isn't the updated image a more suitable one? [[User:Anony20|Anony20]] ([[User talk:Anony20|talk]]) 03:34, 2 December 2020 (UTC)}}
