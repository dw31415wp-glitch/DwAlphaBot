Trying for a more centralized discussion to resolve the ambiguity of having pages titled {{xt|[[Fatima]]}} and {{xt|[[Fatimah]]}}, both of which names can refer to {{xt|[[Fatimah]]}}, the daughter of Muhammad, as romanized versions of the same name in Arabic (فَاطِمَة). A proposal at {{xt|[[Talk:Fatimah#Requested move 23 November 2017|Talk:Fatimah]]}} to disambiguate the title of {{xt|[[Fatimah]]}} found no consensus, with several users saying that {{xt|[[Fatima]]}} should redirect to {{xt|[[Fatimah]]}} as [[WP:PRIMARYREDIRECT|the primary topic]]. Meanwhile a proposal at {{xt|[[Talk:Fatima#Requested move 22 November 2017|Talk:Fatima]]}} to do just that and rename {{xt|[[Fatima]]}} as {{xt|{{no redirect|Fatima (disambiguation)}}}} was rejected. Please indicate which of the options below, if any, would clear up the confusion of names:

* Make {{xt|[[Fatimah]]}} the primary topic and rename {{xt|[[Fatima]]}} as {{xt|{{no redirect|Fatima (disambiguation)}}}};
* Keep the disambiguation page at {{xt|[[Fatima]]}} and make the title of {{xt|[[Fatimah]]}} less ambiguous (for example as {{xt|{{no redirect|Fatimah bint Muhammad}}}});
* Do nothing; leave the existing titles in place.

One argument is that [[demisexuality]] is a form of gray asexuality and is sufficiently covered at the [[Gray asexuality]] article, which is small. It is argued that per [[WP:Spinout]], [[WP:No page]] and [[WP:No split]], there is no need for "demisexuality" to be its own article. The other argument is that "many of the recent sources about demisexuality do not discuss it in the context of asexuality."

{{rfcquote|text=
So there is a dispute about what prominence the phrase "red cunt hair" should have in this article. The main reason to retain it is that it's legitimate sourced content and that [[wp:censor|Wikipedia is not censored]]. The reason to remove some, most or all mentions of it are that it gives [[wp:undue|undue weight]] to a relatively unusual phrase which appears to be from US military slang, in a way which just so happens to make an innocent article substantially focused on female genitalia. From the page history it appears that this material started off as a whole article on [[Red cunt hair]] that was then AfD'd and merged onto this page. Whether that is germane to what we do now, I'm not sure. In my personal view, the [[principle of least astonishment]] is also relevant to this situation. 

In the last few days there have been several versions:
#[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hair%27s_breadth&oldid=813682199 the most full-on version]
#[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hair%27s_breadth&oldid=813399366 retaining all of the material but with lower prominence]
#[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hair%27s_breadth&oldid=813384657 retaining mention of the subject but with less material and reduced prominence]
#[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hair%27s_breadth&oldid=813254402 removing "red cunt hair" entirely]

Which of these version should we adopt for the future development of the article? Regards, [[User:The Land|The Land]] ([[User talk:The Land|talk]]) 20:30, 4 December 2017 (UTC)}}

{{Infobox country
|native_name = Canada
|government_type = [[Federalism|Federal]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]]}}
I propose we use the terms in the infobox I included, because the term "democracy" is too subjective, especially in the context of modern rhetoric where "Democracy" is held to be the greatest ideal. I think using "democracy" causes bias where a supposedly neutral encyclopedia article is effectively calling a certain country a "good" country, which in that case you might as well officially define the United States as a free country in its article, or using opinionated terms like "evil" in Nazi Germany's article. My point is, Wikipedia should be neutral, and even if you agree that Canada is a democracy, or the US is a free country, or Nazi Germany was evil, which many people including me do, it is not up to Wikipedia, which its only role is to provide objective facts. 

I also want to note that pretty much all of what would be seen as free democratic constitutional monarchies also don't use "representative democracy" in its infobox including [[:United Kingdom]], [[:Spain]], [[:Belgium]], [[:Norway]], [[:Netherlands]], [[:Sweden]], [[:Denmark]], or [[:Luxembourg]]. Neither do other commonwealth countries with Elizabeth II as its head of state such as [[:New Zealand]], [[:Jamaica]], [[:Papua New Guinea]], [[:Belize]], [[:The Bahamas]] and others. Australia also uses "democracy" but I'm willing to bet its the same person who added it to Canada. I'm told its irrelevant what other articles do, but I think a hint of consistency is also good sometimes. - [[User:Bokmanrocks01|Bokmanrocks01]] ([[User talk:Bokmanrocks01|talk]]) 01:18, 6 December 2017 (UTC)}}

One view is that an Audience (fan) response section is unencyclopedic and/or [[WP:Undue]] in this case because the backlash to the film is mainly reflected in polls that can be easily manipulated and those who have issue with the film are a significant minority. The other view is that, per [[MOS:FILM#Audience response]], an Audience (fan) response section can be encyclopedic and that it is [[WP:Due]] to include fan response in this case because various reliable sources have noted that there is significant discontent with the film among fans, which goes beyond polling, and that this discontent clashes with what professional critics are stating.

Because of an ARBCOM decision that states any modification to the lead requires an RFC, here we are. Once Trump officially recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital, several parts of the lead needs to be rewritten. Below are the places I found that needs to be modified. Because this RFC is not a simple Yes/No, I think people should propose modifications and we can discuss those modifications.

----""Israelis and Palestinians both claim Jerusalem as their capital, as the State of Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there while the State of Palestine ultimately foresees the city as its seat of power; however, neither claim is widely recognized internationally." 
The ending of this sentence needs modification, along with the NOTE3 that it references.


----"The international community does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and the city hosts no foreign embassies. "
I propose "Most of the international community does.... (or OTher than the US, most of the international community.....)...." 15:30, 6 December 2017 (UTC)}}

We now have a template added to this article saying there is a proposal to merge this article, to [[Istvaeones]] and [[Weser-Rhine Germanic]]. This was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Istvaeonic_languages&diff=814254734&oldid=814174320 added] by [[User:AKAKIOS]]. There is a complicated background I will try to explain:
*Actually ''there were no such articles'' when the "merge proposal" template was added, so this is not a normal merge proposal. These are effectively new articles (whatever their past) which were started by copying this article. And this was in fact done by the editor proposing, at the same time, that this article should be merged to the new articles. Talk page discussion has not been perfect, but probably the editor involved is actually proposing a split of this article?
*Currently we have all aspects of the term Istvaeones covered in this one article called [[Istvaeonic languages]]. There are at least 3 aspects: 1. classical ethnography (the original use of the term by Tacitus and Pliny, arguably the primary use); 2. Linguistics (but Istvaeones is not a common term in that field) and the conventional subject is currently mainly handled under other articles such as [[Frankish]] and [[Low Franconian languages]]. 3. Archaeological, but the more common term for this aspect seems to be "Rhine-Weser Germanic"? Currently this subject is not really being discuss much on English Wikipedia, except a tiny bit on talk pages.
*The one article approach is not new, but previously the material in this article was in the more generally titled [[Istvaeones]]. This was recently turned into a redirect and the material changed a lot and then moved to here, in a series of edits which initiated the current round of edits and discussions. (And then now this action has effectively been partly reversed with the original article receiving a modified copy of material from this new article.)
'''My proposals (feedback please):'''
1. First '''procedural''', while this discussion is proceeding, turn the 2 new articles, which are effectively [[WP:POVFORKS|POV forks]] now, back into redirects to this one article. Move all discussion to here also.
2. My proposal for this "merge" discussion is that, if there is agreement, we stick to a '''one article approach, but move back to [[Istvaeones]]'''.
3. Make the one article primarily about the history of the term, and therefore primarily about the classical ethnography texts.
4. The conventional linguistic aspect, where the term is occasionally used, is mainly handled elsewhere on Wikipedia, and only needs to be mentioned briefly in this Istvaeones article.
5. It seems to me so far that no one has yet written any material for Wikipedia about the supposed archaeological aspect. Until someone writes something significant it deserves no new article. For now it can still be mentioned in the Istvaeonic article, if sourceable, as yet another field where the term has occasionally been mentioned. 
6. FWIW I think that "Rhine-Weser" is a known term, but not "Weser-Rhine". I am not confident about how completely it overlaps with any meaning of Istvaeonic.--[[User:Andrew Lancaster|Andrew Lancaster]] ([[User talk:Andrew Lancaster|talk]]) 08:04, 8 December 2017 (UTC)}}

Therefore I would like to suggest two additions: The first one says how not to use WP:BB, the second one says that instead slapping someone with WP:BB, with possible subsequent further bickering, you better boldly edit yourself.

:(shortcut: [[WP:NOTBOLD]]) '''Being bold [[WP:NOTCOMPULSORY|is not compulsory]]:''' People may have valid reasons for not being bold: one may have not enough time or expertise, one may be unsure in their criticism and wanting more feedback, etc. Therefore a reference to this guideline should not be used as a reprimand for something not done.
::[author's comment: I suppressed my urge to dwell more on the last statement: possible exceptions (e.g. when validly discussing someone's (mis)behavior) or consequences, such as hurt feelings of the criticized.]
:(shortcut: [[WP:BOLDBACK]]) '''Being bold works both ways:''' If you meet with a non-boldness, just fix the article yourself, and readers will see a better article much sooner.

{{rfcquote|text=
So, nobody seems to agree on how this should be dealt with. The current version (actually: the one that was there before page protection) is, arguably, not satisfactory: why those 20 composers? is this really the best picture we can have to represent classical music? why composers?

In the above section ([[Talk:Classical music#Gallery of composers]]), "No such user" argues that having an arbitrary gallery goes against the result of some RfC from February last year. While I personally disagree with that interpretation (which seems to have been aimed at something completely different in the first place), it remains true that a gallery of composers might not be the best option.

As I see it, the following options present themselves:

:'''Option A''' Reinstate the removed version ([[:File:Classical music composers montage.JPG]])

:'''Option B''' Change/remove some composers (make a new version)

:'''Option C''' Put something other than composers (''example'' <small> only for demonstration purposes </small> [[:File:Cesare Gennari Orfeo.jpg]])

:'''Option D''' Remove the image completely (and do not replace)

What is your opinion, and more importantly, why? [[Special:Contributions/135.23.202.24|135.23.202.24]] ([[User talk:135.23.202.24|talk]]) 01:23, 9 December 2017 (UTC)}}

'''Background''' The typical practice in Wikipedia so far is to have families that ''currently rule'' as monarchs over a nation denoted as "royal families" of the respective nation. Examples: [[British royal family]] for the [[United Kingdom]]; [[Swedish royal family]] for [[Sweden]]; [[Norwegian royal family]] for [[Norway]]; [[Spanish royal family]] for [[Spain]]; and so on. (Note that Wikipedia recognizes the House of Bourbon-Anjou as the Spanish royal family, since that is the royal family currently on the throne of Spain, despite the significant existence of [[Carlism|supporters]] of a separate line of the Bourbon dynasty.) 

On  the other hand, families which have ''historically ruled'' as monarchs over a nation in the past are denoted in Wikipedia as "houses of [family name]", or similar notations, avoiding the term "royal." Examples: [[House of Savoy]], for [[Italy]]; [[House of Romanov]] for [[Russia]]; the [[House of Habsburg]] for [[Austria]]; and so on. 

'''Proposal''' We should translate the current practice into a universally applied rule (in words to that effect) : 
:Only families whose members are actually, currently ruling as monarchs (in any regime, from [[constitutional monarchy]] to [[absolute monarchy]]) should be denoted as "royal families" in the title of their respective Wikipedia articles. Articles on all other families, irrespective of how long or recently these families have ruled as monarchs, should have in their title the appropriate surname of the family only, denoted as "house of" or similar.

The fix was directly supported by the reference<br><br>Krešimir Žabec (4 July 2012). "Ministarstvo generalu Praljku: Vaše knjige o ratu spadaju u šund i pornografiju, platit ćete 628.726 kuna poreza!"

Translation: ''Therefore, the Praljak works were appraised as šund (pap, trash) and pornography for which he had to pay VAT (value added tax)''<br><br>In addition the ''schund literature'' phrase is semanically wrong. The ''schund'' is a German word and it's opposite to the literature; therefore saying ''schund literature'' is equally meaningless as ''heiß (hot) ice''. The current phrase "wortless literature" equally makes no sense in English language.

I think that this section is completely unnecessary. Pell is not a world-renown intellectual nor thinker, he is just one of bureaucrats inside the Catholic clergy hierarchy. He became exposed to the public limelight for being the highest ranked official of the RCC accused for sexual abuse coverup and for sexually abusing the children. In the current version we have six pages dedicated to his views and only four dedicated for the abuse coverup and the sexual abuse itself.

I do not see any significance of his views. My proposal is completely eliminate the Views section or reduce it to no more than a half of the page.--[[User:Taribuk|Taribuk]] ([[User talk:Taribuk|talk]]) 14:51, 16 December 2017 (UTC)}}

The question being discussed here is really a question of the economics of crime and correct scientific inference. We don't seem to reach a consensus whether the argument Sarnecki propose here is correct, or if the objections of Sanandaji are valid. Sarnecki argues that immigration has not caused an increase in crime because the crime hasn't risen and immigrant are no longer over represented if you adjust for socioeconomic factors. Sanandaji's objection is that Sarnecki have not proved that immigration hasn't affected the level of crime since he only use aggregated data and not look at the crime level of born citizens which could have decreased. He also objects to the adjustment for socioeconomic factors as they are not relevant for studying the impact.

The original version, written by me and reviewed by [[User:Dr.K.|Dr.K.]] at DYK [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Did_you_know_nominations/Apple_Maggot_Quarantine_Area], is thus: 
:1.''The Apple Maggot Quarantine Area is an area of the world which has been placed under a permanent quarantine by the United States state of Washington.'' [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apple_Maggot_Quarantine_Area&oldid=813689048]
This was changed by [[User:SounderBruce|SounderBruce]] to this, with the edit summary "{{xt|rewriting lead sentence: "of the world" is a bit much}}": 
:2. ''The Apple Maggot Quarantine Area is a permanent quarantine area in the U.S. state of Washington.'' [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apple_Maggot_Quarantine_Area&oldid=816247642]
That was, in turn, changed by me to this, with the edit summary "{{xt|doesn't make sense - the article itself states the quarantine includes Oregon, California, Idaho so incorrect to say it is "in the state of Washington"}}":
:3. ''The Apple Maggot Quarantine Area is a permanent quarantine area.'' [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apple_Maggot_Quarantine_Area&oldid=816314279]
SounderBruce further revised it to the following with the edit summary "{{xt|at least include the country}}":
:4. ''The Apple Maggot Quarantine Area is a permanent quarantine area in the United States.'' [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apple_Maggot_Quarantine_Area&oldid=816371282]
I undid that change, reverting it to version 3, with the edit summary "{{xt|edit makes lede inconsistent with article which states "All "foreign countries where apple maggot is established" have also ..."}}" - resulting in this:
:5. ''The Apple Maggot Quarantine Area is a permanent quarantine area.'' [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apple_Maggot_Quarantine_Area&oldid=816398846]
SounderBruce further amended this with the edit summary "{{Xt|Should be clear that the quarantine only applies within Washington state}}":
:6. ''The Apple Maggot Quarantine Area is a permanent quarantine area in effect within the U.S. state of Washington.'' [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apple_Maggot_Quarantine_Area&oldid=816399293]
Any further edits will run afoul of 3RR, however, (with deference and respect to SB's GF efforts to improve the article) I'm not satisfied with version #6 and would like to solicit feedback as to which version of the lede is more correct to the body of the article: 1, 2, 3/5, 4, 6, or none of those?

# '''Speedy-delete'''. Create a CSD to allow speedy-deleting such articles, under some sort of stringent conditions, e.g. tagged for ["major"?] cleanup and no substantive edits for [3+?] years, no or woefully inadequate sources provided.
# '''Discuss-delete'''. Don't allow CSD, but change deletion policy to explicitly allow deleting such articles, with reasonably stringent guidelines as above to prevent abuse or false urgency/brinksmanship. Hope that at least some of the time, someone in the AFD discussion will instead jump in to improve the article.
# '''Blank'''. Don't delete such articles, but replace them with a template like "A Wikipedia article with this title was started, but was abandoned before a usable article was developed. If you feel this topic is notable, we encourage you to create an article using reliable sources. Previous partial content is available in this page's history if useful."  Remove from generic cleanup categories. This blanking action could either be allowed as a matter of editorial discretion ('''Editorial-Blank'''), again with some guidelines to avoid overuse, or only as a ''soft-delete'' outcome of an AFD discussion ('''AFD-Blank''').
# '''Flag'''. As Blank, but keep the existing article content, just preface it with an editnotice, something like "This Wikipedia article has been abandoned in a state which may be of limited usefulness. Wikipedia is a collaborative encyclopedia; if this topic is of interest, we strongly encourage you to dive in and improve it, using reliable sources."
# And of course, '''Status quo'''. There's no problem, leave such articles as-is in the hope someone will improve them, and continue to ''Keep'' them if someone nominates them AFD, etc, provided the subject is notable and sources appear to exist, etc.

The Speedy-delete option would of course the swiftest at removing embarrassing, useless stuff, but essentially gives up on the tiny ray of hope someone will improve things. It would require the most stringent, bright-line conditions on where it could be applied to be developed. Discuss-delete would harness multiple pairs of eyes to verify, and perhaps productively force a discussion of "OK, are we going to fix this or not?". The remaining two options keep the so-called content available, caveat it for readers, yet encourage someone to sometime jump in, and reclassify the cleanup backlog to segregate out articles where realistically normal cleanup isn't going to be sufficient or even happen.

In the "impact on other artists" section, there were several reliable sources promoting OMD that all contained the same sentence, asserting that certain groups "the XX and the Killers, have cited OMD as an inspiration/influence" without quoting any musician/act. We know that sometimes if one journalist first said in a RS "band A have cited band B as an influence", other articles would reproduce the same assertion, believing the assertion of the previous journalist and without doing any fact checking themselves. There have been many assertions in the press advancing that "Pet Shop Boys have cited Soft Cell as an influence" whereas Pet Shop Boys strongly denied it in interviews saying they didn't listen to Soft Cell.

So do you agree to only mention bands when strong reliable sources mentioning quotes of musicians, are available ?  The "impact on other artists" section only includes at the moment names of the musicians that have actually hailed OMD in interviews or covered a song, that being supported by RS.---[[User:Woovee|Woovee]] ([[User talk:Woovee|talk]]) 02:16, 23 December 2017 (UTC)}}

The goal here is to '''raise notability standards for companies.'''

There is a main proposal and an additional one. Please make sure you !vote about each one. 

;Main proposal (#1 if you like)
<blockquote>A for-profit company is considered "notable" in Wikipedia if it satisfies the GNG criteria and, in addition, any of the following criteria are met:
# It is a publicly traded company with at least a $1B market capitalization
# It is a private company that has raised more than $100M and has been in business for at least 5 years 
# It has been listed as a member of the [[Fortune 1000]], [[Forbes Global 2000]], or an equivalently regarded business ranking.
# It is considered by multiple independent reliable sources to have made a culturally significant impact. This is distinct from passing local controversies, local patronage (custom), getting good reviews, or the like.
# It is regarded by multiple independent reliable sources as having significant impact in its industry, including technical breakthroughs in marketed products. This is distinct from mundane [[product differentiation]]-type claims; every company is "unique". 
# It has been involved in fraud, antitrust, or another activity that receives enough ongoing coverage to meet [[WP:NCRIME]].</blockquote>

;Additional criterion (#2 if you like)
* It employs at least 1,500 people

Recent corrections to update vessel designations have been repeatedly reverted to incorrect and outdated names.  To ensure accuracy and reliability, articles should have the current and correct designation used throughout encyclopedia.  The [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] is the authority for designations and maintains the [[Naval Vessel Register]] which is the official inventory of ships of the United States Navy.  

For example, the [[USS Lewis B. Puller (ESB-3)]] is a type of vessel operated by [[Military Sealift Command]].  They were official re-designated by the [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] in 2015 to Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB), having previously been called Mobile Landing Platform and Afloat Forward Staging Base.  Corrections to articles to reflect the correct designation of the vessels have repeatedly reverted to outdated monikers.  Is there preference for using older information instead of correct designations per current and official U.S. Navy policy?

I have prepared a plan to shorten the article to great extent. I hope you can agree. I also welcome suggestions.:

* The well-written articles often don't cover all the minute details. My suggestion is to eliminate unimportant things that aren't notable beyond one or two sources or don't make a real impact on the battle.
**This includes elimination of all non-notable killings, or areas captured. For example, x number of terrorists killed or building captured on this day reported by only one or two minor sources and do not have any real impact.
* Separate articles for those offensives of the battle that deserve it like [[Western Nineveh offensive (2017)]]. Only events of these offensive having major impact on the battle should be included in the main article, for example supply lines was cut after x town was captured.
* I suggest creating a separate article for violations of laws of war incl. killings of civilians. The main article should only have a short summary on the subject.
** I also suggest that the very notable killings during the battle like the [[2017 Mosul airstrike]], the other killings should be relegated to the violation of laws of war.

Changes are necessary in order to more easily clear disputes (including deletion disputes) on self-serving articles, because such edits cannot be entirely eliminated. I am signaling here a case of <b>self-promoting by Wikipedia itself</b>: Whoever made that [[Disruptive_innovation#Practical_example_of_disruption|Disruptive Innovation entry]], placed Wikipedia in the ''academia category'' (which is false) just to put it on top of the list -- and I could iterate 3 more case of self promoting articles I encountered in the last two months only.    
# With certain exceptions, new articles should be allowed a given number of months to mature, before they are proposed for deletion. Better yet, articles (new or old) should be reviewed for deletion periodically, based on their low traffic. 
# Voting in an article-deletion case should NOT be permitted to unregistered users.  
# Users known to have added content to articles of the same categories as the article proposed for deletion <b>should be invited automatically</b> to cast their vote. In this respect the following features should be implemented by Wikipedia developers:  
# The edits of registered users should be metered and used to build a database of users' expertise. An expertise level on a subject should associated with the user's name, with the possibility of displaying such an expertise rank on the respective user's page.

{{rfcquote|text=
There is currently a content dispute among three editors, including myself. 

These are current major elements of this dispute regarding the existence of the STC: 

:1. Does the Southern Transitional Council exist, as an independent organization from the Hadi-led government of Yemen? 
:2. Is the [[Southern Movement]] in fact affiliated to the Southern Transitional Council? 
:3. Are the Southern Transitional Council's territories on the [[Template:Yemeni Civil War detailed map|YCW war map]] ([[Module:Yemeni Civil War detailed map|module]]) effectively under the control of the Hadi-led government? 
:4. Is the STC at war with the Hadi-led government? 

Please keep in mind that the situation is evolving and keep in mind that the current RfC should generally be limited to these questions, and should not go to questions that cannot be resolved without depending on an answer to one of these four questions.

Before I begin I want to say that I am all for a funny and creative joke, but we need to draw the line somewhere to avoid this becoming a collection of titles. 

The entries that I removed included:

*Cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc

Should the following be added to this article? See discussion [[Talk:Noah_Oppenheim#Weinstein_content|above]] if you like. 

<blockquote>Oppenheim worked with [[Ronan Farrow]] on the conception of the story about the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]] and the network supported his investigation for several months, but in the summer of 2017 the network withdrew support as the end of Farrow's contract approached, and Farrow took the story to the ''The New Yorker'' which published it in October after the ''New York Times'' broke the story.  NBC News's failure to publish the story it had developed became a point of criticism and subject of reporting in itself, and Oppenheim defended the news division in response.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Koblin|first1=John|title=How Did NBC Miss Out on a Harvey Weinstein Exposé?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/business/media/nbc-news-harvey-weinstein.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=11 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Guthrie|first1=Marisa|title=Why Ronan Farrow's Harvey Weinstein Bombshell Did Not Run on NBC|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-ronan-farrows-harvey-weinstein-bombshell-did-not-run-nbc-1047671|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=October 11, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Guthrie|first1=Marisa|title=Ronan Farrow, the Hollywood Prince Who Torched the Castle|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/ronan-farrow-hollywood-prince-who-torched-castle-1073405|accessdate=11 January 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=|date=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Folkenflik|first1=David|last2=Martin|first2=Rachel|title=Decision Not To Publish Weinstein Story Roils NBC|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/10/12/557355945/decision-not-to-publish-weinstein-story-roils-nbc|work=NPR Morning Edition|date=October 12, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Stelter|first1=Brian|title=How NBC gave up Ronan Farrow's explosive Harvey Weinstein scoop|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/11/media/nbc-new-yorker-harvey-weinstein/index.html|work=CNN|date=October 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Warren|first1=James|authorlink1=James Warren (journalist)|title=How Badly Did NBC Blow the Weinstein Story?|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/how-badly-did-nbc-news-blow-the-weinstein-story|work=Vanity Fair|date=October 13, 2017|language=en|quote=To exhibit a firm grasp of the obvious: One of the finest publications on the planet took a look at whatever Oppenheim took a pass on and felt it was worth the effort.

There is a disagreement with another editor about whether a musical artist's template, which is usually placed at the bottom of their song articles, should be placed at the bottom of this article which is about a song that the artist ([[Ellie Goulding]]) is not a part of, other than on the initial unreleased version (which will never be released because her label negated all agreements and talks). The other editor's claim is that since there are significant sources about Ellie Goulding being a part of the unreleased version, her template should be placed in the article with no regards to Wikipedia customs.

How exactly should nationality be defined for a referee? Obviously in the vast number of cases, a referee would represent a country he has citizenship of, or was born in, but this isn't always the case:
* ''Example 1'': [[Steve Walsh (rugby referee)|Steve Walsh]] – born in New Zealand, refereed for New Zealand between 1998 and 2009 and for Australia between 2009 and 2015. Should he be regarded as a New Zealand referee, or as both an Australian and a New Zealand referee?
* ''Example 2'': [[Rasta Rasivhenge]] – born in South Africa, refereed for South Africa since 2011, except in 2014, when he refereed for Australia. Should he be regarded as a South African referee, or as both an Australian and a South African referee?
* ''Example 3'': [[Andrew Brace]] – born in Wales, but refereed for Ireland. Should he be regarded as an Irish referee or a Welsh referee?
If one refers to a referee as an "<country> referee", what does this mean? It it his actual nationality (i.e. what citizenship he has), or is it "sporting nationality" (i.e. which country he represented as a referee). <br/> By my logic:
* If nationality refers to the country the referee is actually from, then Walsh should be classified as a New Zealand referee, Rasivhenge as a South African referee and Brace as a British referee.
* If nationality refers to the the referee's "sporting nationality", then Walsh should be classified as both an Australian and a New Zealand referee, Rasivhenge as both a South African and an Australian referee and Brace as an Irish referee.
Which interpretation should be used to determine a referee's nationality? Feedback greatly welcomed. [[User:TheMightyPeanut|TheMightyPeanut]] ([[User talk:TheMightyPeanut|talk]]) 00:12, 15 January 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I have extended full protection for one more week while the RFC plays out.  Please note, I don't have an opinion here, the question is presented simply to answer the issue at hand.  I will not vote but I will take action if any editor makes personal attacks or is grossly uncivil.

'''Proposal'''

The issue is to '''include''' or '''exclude''' the word "''decisive''" in the infobox as a descriptor of the victory.  The current template strongly discourages the use of a qualifier, but under [[WP:IAR]], it does not prohibit it, thus it is a matter of local consensus.  The template is a stable one so we can assume it has consensus as a general guideline.  The sole question is whether or not this particular article should be an exception to standard practice, for whatever reason.  

At an appropriate time (a week or longer), this will be closed and will provide a clear consensus as to the state of the article, and will serve as demonstration of that consensus until a new RFC demonstrates otherwise.  At that time, anyone edit warring against the consensus will be blocked.  Please use short, policy based reasons in the polling area and not just a vote.  Please keep threaded comments in the "Discussion" area.  

You are encouraged to advertise this RFC on appropriate projects so long as it is a neutral notification and not an endorsement of any side of the issue.  Notifying editors individually will probably be seen as canvassing, so I don't suggest it.  Again, keep it civil, on topic and professional, please.  

'''Until this RFC closes, do not modify the current infobox entry, even if protection expires.  This will be seen as edit warring and will result in a block without warning.'''  This isn't an endorsement of the current version, it is a preventative measure to stop warring until a consensus is reached.

{{rfcquote|text=
For the word ''Secularism'', which is found in the second sentence of the article, I propose adding a caveat to this bold statement, given that Turkish society has changed considerably over the years.

I propose modifying the sentence to:

{{cquote|'''Turkey is officially secular, despite recent policies by the ruling AKP to create a more Islamic society.''' It is a unitary, parliamentary republic; slated to transition to a presidential system in 2019, following a 2017 referendum.}}

I also strongly suggest to move the secular, unitary, and parliamentary stuff out as the second sentence of the article, and move it to a more appropriate section in the lead, namely the parts of the lead that talk about secularism and government. The first couple of sentences of such an article should not bother talking about referendums and Islamist curtailing of secularism. And just a reminder: I am not going against any RFC conclusion by doing this. ''Secularism'' and ''parliamentary republic'' would still be in the lead, but this modification will give a more accurate description of the developments in Turkey.

A new single-purpose account is trying to change the description of Hamilton's NY State Senate caucus, the Independent Democratic Caucus. The essence is that while elected as Democrats, the IDC supports the Republican leadership in the State Senate.  No reliable source disputes that; for example, a NY Times article about the IDC states that "... the Independent Democratic Conference, a coalition of eight Democratic senators who collaborate with Republicans to share leadership in the chamber. By doing so, members of the I.D.C. reap perks and power that they would not normally receive had they remained with the mainline Democrats."

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/nyregion/new-york-independent-democratic-conference-republicans.html?_r=0

I won't break 3RR, but I believe the community will agree that the nature of the IDC is of key importance to Hamilton's political status, and needs to be properly described in the lede  -- as it was until these recent edits.

We've had a lengthy, mostly civil, and wholly unresolved discussion on what we should name the current government of Syria in the article. On one side we have editors proposing to name it "Assad government" after the President, with the reasoning that it has lost legitimacy as a government, and is now contested by other organisations claiming to be the de jure government in Syria.
On the other side we have editors (mostly me) positing that naming it after the President is the product of propaganda used by the opposition that wasn't present before the conflict.

Hypothetical example, would it be acceptable to go to the [[Pop punk]] article and insert a photo of [[Blink 182]] in the infobox at the top of the article. (This example assumes that they are widely regarded by sources to be pop punk, which they are. The question is not about genre-warring, but about infobox image use.)

{{rfcquote|text=
{{@|Davey2010}} and myself have a disagreement about the date format to be use in references. The article has for a very long time used yyyy-mm-dd in references and MDY in the article text. As given in the section above, my reasoning is that [[MOS:DATEUNIFY]] says all dates in an article should be of the same format <u>but allows for references to use yyyy-mm-dd regardless of the format used in the rest of the article</u>. [[MOS:DATEFORMAT]] backs this up with 'Special rules apply to citations; {{crossref|see {{section link|Wikipedia:Citing sources|Citation style}}}}.' Since yyyy-mm-dd is not allowed to be used in the normal text of the article (ie outside of references and tables), forcing the references to use the same date format as the article effectively disallows yyyy-mm-dd altogether. Why would DATEUNIFY and DATEFORMAT and [[WP:CITESTYLE]] even bother to specify yyyy-mm-dd at all if other guidelines rule it out?

The article has used yyyy-mm-dd for a long time. Davey2010 changed the references to MDY based on his interpretation of [[WP:DATEUNIFY]] on 23 January 2018. I noticed it on 25 January 2018 but there were enough other changes that a simple revert would wipe out too many other changes. On 27 January 2018 I figured out how to change it back to yyyy-mm-dd without affecting intermediate edits via a regular expression script. On 28 January 2018 Davey2010 reverted me again, I reverted him once more and he reverted me once more. Obviously we are in the beginnings of an edit war. I have stopped reverting for the moment not because I believe Davey2010 is right but because an edit war is fruitless.

Note also that both of us agree to [[WP:RETAIN]] (whereby the article should not be changed without consensus). However, Davey2010 believes that RETAIN applies only <u>after</u> his MDY change of 23 January 2018 and not to the status quo for years before that of yyyy-mm-dd. We seem to have a similar disagreement of interpreting [[WP:BRD]] for when to restore the article to during the discussion.

Can others please comment on whether my interpretation of the [[MOS:DATEUNIFY]], [[MOS:DATEFORMAT]] and [[WP:CITESTYLE]] guidelines is correct or whether Davey2010's interpretation is correct? <span style="border:1px solid blue;border-radius:4px;color:blue;box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px grey;">[[User:Stepho-wrs|'''&nbsp;Stepho&nbsp;''']]&nbsp;<span style="font-size:xx-small; vertical-align:top">[[User Talk:Stepho-wrs|talk]]&nbsp;</span></span> 04:54, 28 January 2018 (UTC)}}

The dispute is whether to include the infobox featuring the symbols of the Republic of Abkhazia (such as the flag), which are normally included on all country articles. Abkhazia is a partially-recognized country. Those wanting the infobox in the article argue that it should be in the article because other partially-recognized countries (such as [[South Ossetia]] and [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]]) currently have an infobox. Also, the Abkhazia articles in other languages have the infobox. The argument is that an exception should not be made for Abkhazia (i.e. it shouldn't be the only partially-recognized country without an infobox). Those opposing the infobox say it puts too much weight on the Republic of Abkhazia. But the question then is, where does the infobox go? (Onto a new article titled "Republic of Abkhazia"?) A previous RfC was started on this issue, but that RfC had no consensus. Currently the infobox keeps being added and then reverted by multiple editors. See also the section "Splitting the Abkhazia article" above, which has not resolved the issue so far. 01:45, 12 January 2018 (UTC)}}

While suggestions on improvement is welcome, he seems intent on zero sum rollbacks and refuses discussion or compromise.

'''Issue statement''':<br />
We have arrived at a bewildering profusion of ENGVAR-related templates, the only purpose of which seems to be advancing nationalistic viewpoints.  For those not reading the discussion above this one, the short version is that in an encyclopedic, formal [[Register (socio-linguistics)|register]], there is no meaningful difference between English, Scottish, Irish, Australian, New Zealand, African, Hong Kong, etc., varieties of English, only between [[Commonwealth English]] as a dialect continuum and the North American varieties ([[American English]], and [[Canadian English]] which is a hybrid of American and British/Commonwealth).  Commonwealth English is based on UK-published style guides; there are virtually no reliably published style manuals for Commonwealth dialects that are not produced in England in particular (by contrast, US and Canadian English are the subject of multiple mainstream style guides published in those countries).

'''Concrete proposal''':
* For WP purposes, we would just a {{tlx|Use Commonwealth English}} template with a {{tlx|Use European English}} redirect to it (since Ireland is not part of the Commonwealth at present). That will cover the full gamut of non-North American dialects of English following the style most often called "British".
* We would retain {{tlx|Use American English}} and {{tlx|Use Canadian English}} to cover the North American written dialects.  Canadian is essentially a hybrid of US and British, and there are multiple, reputably published style guides for both US and Canadian writing.
* This would take care of the quiet, categorizing templates in [[:Category:Use English templates]]; the big talk-page and editnotice banner equivalents (e.g. {{tlx|American English}}, etc.) in [[:Category:Varieties of English templates]] would also be merged into a corresponding set of templates.
* Categories used would also, naturally, be merged as needed.
* [[MOS:ENGVAR]] and [[MOS:TIES]] would be clarified and shortened, no longer suggesting that things be written in Pakistani English, etc., which is essentially meaningless with regard to encyclopedic prose.

I haven't found any guidelines on this, so I apologize if this topic's been discussed and closed before.

Per [[MOS:CURRENCY]]: {{xt|In country-specific articles, such as Economy of Australia, use the currency of the subject country.}} [...] {{xt|In general, the first mention of a particular currency should use its full, unambiguous signifier (e.g. A$52), with subsequent references using just the appropriate symbol (e.g. $88), unless this would be unclear.}}

A quick browse of infoboxes for some [[OECD#Member_countries|existing countries]] shows no signifier for the type of dollar used to denote their GDP. However, the [[IMF]] seems to be universally cited for the numbers, which notes the amount is in US Dollars. That information is only viewable if the reader opens the reference link. This can be confusing for readers outside the US as the dollar sign is a currency symbol for [[Dollar|multiple countries]], including [[Mexican peso|Mexico's peso]], and en.Wikipedia is the [https://tools.wmflabs.org/langviews/?project=en.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&range=latest-20&sort=views&direction=1&view=list&page=Main_Page most read] of WMF's projects around the world.

I propose adding language to the infobox parameters that ambiguous currency symbols (e.g. [[$]], [[¥]], [[₩]] etc.) should be prepended with the appropriate [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO code]] as prescribed by [[MOS:CURRENCY]]. The [[Template:Infobox_country#Examples|Examples]] and [[Template:Infobox_country#TemplateData|TemplateData]] section on this infobox's page should show currency code examples like [[US$]]10.5 billion or [[HK$]]10.5 billion, dependent of course on what currency the reference uses. Unambiguous symbols, like the Indian rupee ([[₹]]) should just be wikilinked without the ISO code. - <span style="text-shadow: 4px 4px 15px #0099FF, -4px -4px 15px #99FF00;"><b>[[User:GrapefruitSculpin|GS]]</b></span> ⋙ <span style="text-shadow: 4px 4px 15px #FF9900, -4px -4px 15px #FF0099;">[[User_talk:GrapefruitSculpin|☎]]</span> 07:32, 19 January 2018 (UTC)}}

The bot has posted hundreds of thousands of these messages on various Wikipedia article talk pages since 2016.

Why? 
*IABot's error rate has dropped to near negligible numbers.
*Users really interested in checking the edit, will do so without being asked to.
*If the bot did make an error, with IABot's newest upgrade in v1.6, simply reverting the bot is enough to report a bad edit as a false positive.

Hi, all. Per [[Talk:Star Wars: The Last Jedi#Should we include an Audience response section?|an RfC]], editors (myself included) have worked on a draft at [[Draft:Star Wars Last Jedi audience response]] and its talk page. We are just about done, but there are remaining disagreements and we need comments from other editors to finally get this material into the article. The main disagreements are the following: There [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Draft_talk:Star_Wars_Last_Jedi_audience_response&oldid=821321762#Opening_line is debate] on whether or not to present the "divisive" aspect first and whether or not it is [[WP:Due]] or WP:Undue. With regard to the parentage aspect, there is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Draft_talk:Star_Wars_Last_Jedi_audience_response&oldid=821321762#Rey_as_a_Skywalker debate] on whether or not, in order to give give an example instead of being vague, we should mention that many fans were expecting [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] to be [[Luke Skywalker|Luke's]] daughter. Or whether we should mention a few examples. And there is debate on whether or not to plainly state that many fans felt that Luke's actions in ''The Last Jedi'' contrasted his previous heroic portrayal or to instead state that many fans felt that he should have been portrayed more heroically; how to word this can be worked out later. There was also [[alt-right]] debates, but we have kept that material out of the draft. I present '''three versions''' below. Obviously, none of these versions mean that the section cannot be edited further afterward. Coming to a consensus on one of the versions simply means that we can finally move forward.

Various names are editing this article to lead with details about its operation as a Church. However, the news sources themselves question whether or not it is actually a marijuana dispensary operating as a Church and the City is trying to shut down their operations. The notability of this article is due based on this dispute between the City which calls it a marijuana dispensary and the 'Church'. I edited it to be more even handed and include details of the dispute in the lead but keep getting reverted by various names (who may or may not be the same person or group trying to push their side of this dispute). Its current form is biased and misleading trying to bury the claims that this newly formed 'Church' is actually a marijuana dispensary.

Until recently this article has been about an organization called The Satanic Temple whose members were [[Satanists]], recently it was been decided through editor consensus that The Satanic Temple is not only an organization but also it's own religion, whose members are also called Satanists. As this is a new stand alone religion this Satanism is different from the pre-existing religion of Satanism. As it so happens there is an existing disambiguation page [[Satanism_(disambiguation)]] to clarify uses of the term Satanism & Satanist.

Presently, [[MOS:NUMS]] includes:
{{talk quote|Sometimes, the variety of English used in an article may necessitate the use of a numbering system other than the Western thousands-based system. For example, the South Asian numbering system is conventionally used in South Asian English. In those situations, link the first spelled-out instance of each quantity (e.g. [[crore]], which yields: crore).}}
This is followed by three more bullet points of [[WP:CREEP]] about ''[[crore]]''.  The lead sentence of this is just patently false; nothing necessitates the use of alternative numbering systems.  Proof that Indian English doesn't do so abounds (including with regard to Indian currency) [https://www.google.com/search?num=20&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=Rs+60+million+site%3Ain+-convert+-imdb+-wikipedia+-wiki+-crore+-cr], [https://www.google.com/search?num=20&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=billion+site%3Ain+-convert+-imdb+-wikipedia+-wiki], [https://www.google.com/search?num=20&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=27+million+site%3Ain+-convert+-imdb+-wikipedia+-wiki], [https://www.google.com/search?num=20&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=80+million+site%3Ain+-convert+-imdb+-wikipedia+-wiki] etc., etc.

'''I propose that this be deleted''' and replaced with a) short advice against use of crore in Wikipedia articles, unless conversion is provided to Western numbers, and b) retaining the advice against using "1,00,00,000" for "10,000,000". 

'''Rationale''': I do not believe the present wording has actual consensus, and crore are rarely used in our articles even on Indian subjects.  Some small number of Indian editors have somehow gotten MoS to be permissive about crore, despite it being non-English and meaning nothing to most anyone outside that part of the world, and despite English-speakers of India having no problem with "ten million" (or "10,000,000", "10mil", "10M", etc.)<br /><span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''']] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] 😼 </span> 05:08, 24 January 2018 (UTC)}}

I have been given numerous amounts of feedback regarding the placement of ranking charts within music albums.  I have stated that per [[WP:IDEALSTUB]], that sufficient context shall be given in placing ranking charts within an article, even if the chart is almost identical to a chart table that exists in an artist, ensemble, or discography page, and might not be formatted in an ideal manner.  Some of these music ranking charts are difficult to manipulate, therefore, leeway should be permitted to persons who wish to copy and paste the information from one article to another, so long as they update the references to an appropriate access date.  If the chart is identical, the information is still there, even if the table contains empty columns.  Additionally, I have been scolded about putting music ranking charts for singles in an album article, if the artist/ensemble/discography page already has these rankings.  I think that users should be permitted to add these to album articles. --[[User:Jax 0677|Jax 0677]] ([[User talk:Jax 0677|talk]]) 17:10, 24 January 2018 (UTC)}}

Trying to reach consensus on my last edit which was labeled as "white washing" and "promotion;" I condensed several parts of the article that were outdated and broken up. For example, you would read about current news then it would jump back to the 70's. The only other additional edits I made was the removal of two photos which if you read the article take up space and don't account for nearly as much. The store moved four times, the first photo is from a short lived store that was mentioned in one line and existed briefly over 170 years ago. The other is an outdated photo of the 5th avenue store and claims to represent the building before the renovations they're starting in 2019. The second photo in my opinion can be relevant but should be a better photo if used for this purpose. Any thoughts?

Per previous discussions over at [[Wikipedia talk:Days of the year]], it seems that there is some level of support for some kind of inclusion criteria for what articles to include on the Births and Deaths sections. There are some concerns that these sections are too-Western centric (i.e. people from North America or Europe are over-represented).

The question now is: should we have some kind of guideline for inclusion in Births and Dates articles? Or is the status-quo fine? In my case, my pet proposal is that a proposed inclusion criteria would be similar to what's currently done at [[WP:DYK]], where no more than half of each set can be about US-related topics. Though of course, other editors are free to propose other proposals here.

I believe that this violates [[MOS:PLOT]]: "the plot summary must not present interpretations of the creators' intent.

The fact that it requires two sources to back it up demonstrates, in my opinion, that this is the case here. Author [[Ursula K.

The primary argument here for noninclusion has appeared to be that such mentions by the blp's subject, found accompanying political commentary published at partisan opinion platforms (Breitbart, FNC, TheBlaze, the conservative imprint at Penguin Books, her own web platforms such as on Twitter), render such sourcing [[wp:BIASED]], therefore no such sourcing ought be resorted to within a blp. The primary argument pro-inclusion has seemed to be that, despite considerations of partisan media, within the spirit of [[wp:SELFPUB]], a subject is a reliable source about herself.--07:07, 28 February 2018 (UTC)}}

'''Merge This article &rarr; [[Trump–Russia dossier]]'''

This article doesn't really have a good reason to stand alone other than length, and length is a problem that can be addressed with formatting and proper prose integration. If we merged this article into [[Trump–Russia dossier|the main article]], we could trim out all but the dry text outlining the allegation (a step that would, I believe, address many of the NPOV complaints made here), leaving the commentary to the main parts of the article. This could be formatted in a number of ways that would not make that article over-long. Indeed, much of the dry text describing the allegations could be trimmed significantly, as the details will have been given in the main body already. I mean, this article is about ''the contents'' of the dossier. I don't see any need to fork that off from the main article. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml">[[User:MjolnirPants|<font color="green">'''ᛗᛁᛟᛚᚾᛁᚱPants'''</font>]] [[User_talk:MjolnirPants|<small>Tell me all about it.</small>]]</span> 17:35, 10 February 2018 (UTC)}}

Since last year, [[User:‎Michael 182]], also as [[User:TwentySteps]] (blocked) and via various IP edits (some blocked for socking), has been splitting several film award articles that were previously arranged in one whole table, most of them sortable, into tables by decades. Venice Festival awards: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Golden_Lion&type=revision&diff=808058639&oldid=806091076], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Silver_Lion&type=revision&diff=808062802&oldid=799768892], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Volpi_Cup_for_Best_Actor&type=revision&diff=808066192&oldid=803129364], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Volpi_Cup_for_Best_Actress&type=revision&diff=808099890&oldid=803130412]. Berlin Festival awards: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Golden_Bear&type=revision&diff=807743545&oldid=800928169], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Silver_Bear_for_Best_Director&type=revision&diff=807958060&oldid=800929501], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Silver_Bear_for_Best_Actor&type=revision&diff=807960820&oldid=801812885], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Silver_Bear_for_Best_Actress&type=revision&diff=808049871&oldid=801819695]. He has also done various changes in Academy Awards and Primetime Emmy Awards which are outside of my scope of interest in films. Note also that I have not opposed the division by decades in director and actor awards as this is also outside my focus of interest, plus I find no meaningful sortability damaged in so splitting them.

From several discussions I have participated or just followed in WP:Film, I am aware that by longstanding consensus the preferred format for presenting film award lists, is by using one stortable table. Splitting such a table to smaller tables by decades (sortable or not) disables any meaningful sortability throughout the whole list. If split by decades, one cannot get either a full alphabetical list of Directors or of Films that won a certain award any longer. Since the user claims that there is not sufficient evidence that such consensus exists, I am doing here a formal RfC to have some consensus on this issue clearly found in one place, also for future reference. 1. Should the film award articles be kept in one sortable table or split in decades? 2. Should director and actress/actor awards be kept in one sortable table or split in decades?

The role of admins in the DYK process as defined in the instructions, and the role as practiced, differ widely. Moreover, different admins treat their role differently, and based on past discussions, have widely divergent views on what the role should be. For folks unfamiliar with the process, admins are required to move approved DYK hooks from Prep areas to Queues. The question here is what, if any, further checks admins are required to perform during this process.  

Since there are many possible combinations here, I have structured this to permit maximum flexibility in the outcome. Therefore, please feel free to add additional checks that you think admins are required to do, that I may have left out.

As some of my previous suggestions were disagreed upon, I think it will be best to take suggestions one subject at a time. To shorten the article I suggest separating notable offensives that were not directly aimed at the city but were a part of it. For example the [[Western Nineveh offensive (2017)]] has its own article. 

Instead, I suggest only the major details of the offensive let be remain here in this main article of the battle. And the other details like this many areas were captured in that particular offensive be shifted to that article until they are notable or widely covered in the media. 

This way the content will remain preserved on Wikipedia but the Mosul battle article will still be shortened somewhat. It will also help people to discover this content easily which they might not have earlier due to the huge contet in this article.

'''tl;dr version:''' I propose that we change [[:Category:Infobox templates]] to a {{tl|all included}}/{{tl|tracking category}}, and get all the benefits this would entail.

'''Current situation/Proposed solution'''

Currently [[:Category:Infobox templates]] is setup as a {{tl|container category}} [with a handful of infoboxes which are mistakenly in the category], which is pretty much completely useless. Infoboxes are sub-categorized in an extremely incomplete way, so finding anything is almost impossible simply because this scheme is pretty much ignored, on top of just badly designed in general. Try to find something like {{tl|Infobox journal}} from the main category, and you'll be spending a long time browsing things before realizing it's located in
*[[:Category:Infobox templates]]
**[[:Category:Arts and culture infobox templates]]
***[[:Category:Publishing infobox templates]]
or
*[[:Category:Infobox templates]]
**[[:Category:Society and social science infobox templates]]
***[[:Category:Organization infobox templates]]
And that's when it's categorized in the first place. You can't get to {{tl|Infobox ABL team}}, because it's not categorized.

So to fix/improve this situation, I propose that we change [[:Category:Infobox templates]] to a {{tl|all included}}/{{tl|tracking category}}. This would have several benefits, such as (non-exhaustive list):
*All infoboxes would conveniently be listed directly there. If you're looking for something ABL related, you just browse the category and look for ABL. If you're looking for {{tl|Infobox magazine}}, you go in the ''M'' section and look for magazine.
*The category could then be easily searched with an <code>:incategory</code> call in [[:Special:Search]]. If you're looking for a retail-related infobox, you could just search for [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=retail+incategory%3A%22Infobox+templates%22&title=Special:Search&profile=all&fulltext=1&searchToken=1n08vfke7nwvxs49sedlq9unx 'retail'], and you'd find {{tl|Infobox retail market}} quite easily.
*The category could then be used to easily monitor recent changes/vandalism via [[:Special:RecentChangesLinked/Category:Infobox templates]].
*The category could then be used by [[WP:AALERTS]] to create article alerts for [[WP:WikiProject Infoboxes]].

The category could be automatically populated and correctly sorted by the {{tl|Infobox}} template itself (and other similar templates) in the vast majority of cases (at the very least anything that starts with ''Template:Infobox foobar'' can be), with the rest being manually categorized. This wouldn't change the subcategory system, so editors could still find {{tl|Infobox element}} via
*[[:Category:Infobox templates]]
**[[:Category:Science and nature infobox templates]]
***[[:Category:Chemistry infobox templates]]
****[[:Category:Periodic table infobox templates]]
if they prefer browsing that way. <span style="font-variant:small-caps; whitespace:nowrap;">[[User:Headbomb|Headbomb]] {[[User talk:Headbomb|t]] · [[Special:Contributions/Headbomb|c]] · [[WP:PHYS|p]] · [[WP:WBOOKS|b]]}</span> 12:43, 21 February 2018 (UTC)}}

I brought up in a [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Musicians/Archive 10#RfC: Band member timelines|previous discussion]] that I would probably do this down the track – and pretty much made most of my argument there – so I figured there's no better time than the present. I've seen bands that have had large numbers of line-up changes (e.g. [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Megadeth]]) and have their own members subpages – this is where I believe it is most appropriate to have them. Others have only had minimal changes or disruptions to their respective line-ups (e.g. [[Foo Fighters]], [[Linkin Park]], [[Pearl Jam]]), yet still have these subpages where they, in my opinion, aren't necessary.

I will restate my opinion (from the above discussion) that '''members subpages should only exist if there have been a large number of line-up changes and/or complex circumstances''' – does anyone agree with this statement? Please answer "'''Yes'''" or "'''No'''" in the survey below and, if agreed upon, use the discussion to discuss what number of line-up changes should constitute a members subpage – otherwise, feel free to state your opinion in either section. I would define "large number of line-up changes and/or complex circumstances" as about ten or more former members and/or line-up changes (criteria met by the first three bands that I mentioned, and not by the second three). <b style="font-family:Arial">[[User:4TheWynne|<span style="color:darkblue">4TheWynne</span>]]<sup>[[User talk:4TheWynne|<span style="color:darkblue">(talk)</span>]][[Special:Contribs/4TheWynne|<span style="color:darkblue">(contribs)</span>]]</sup></b> 04:47, 6 February 2018 (UTC)}}

===Background'''

Given recent disruption caused by non-admin closures of [[WP:AFD]], I am proposing that non-admin closures/relistings be banned except in very limited circumstances. The most obvious exception being when someone withdraws their own nomination (there may be one or two other exceptions but that's the only one that comes to mind for me). Here are two recent ANIs where someone has created disruption by closing an AfD [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Many_non-admin_AfD_closures_by_User:Jdcomix] & [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive971#Inappropriate_AfD_closure_by_number_of_votes]. This seems to be a recurring issue and I think this is the best way to deal with it. I understand that admins are busy and others try to help, but it is actually creating more work when someone has to go back and review poor closings/relistings.--[[User:Rusf10|Rusf10]] ([[User talk:Rusf10|talk]]) 01:37, 19 February 2018 (UTC)}}

After being pointed out by Newyorkbrad at AN earlier that we might want to find a streamlined way to deal with community bans for repeated sockmasters to avoid what has become a recent trend of seeking formal bans for them at AN, I began workshopping some language with other users, and would like to propose the following additions be made to [[Wikipedia:Banning policy]]:
{{talkquote|Editors who have been found to have engaged in sockpuppetry on at least two occasions after an initial indefinite block, for whatever reason, are considered ''de facto'' banned by the Wikipedia community. Publicly documented CheckUser evidence should typically be involved before a user is considered banned in this way. Users fitting this criteria are subject to the same unban conditions as users banned by community discussion.{{pb}}Administrators should typically place a notice at Wikipedia:Administrators' Noticeboard alerting the community of such a ban as well as place [[Template:Banned user]] to the master's user page and add the user to any relevant Arbitration Committee sanctions enforcement list.}}
The terms of the proposal would make it so that after three indefinite blocks, a user is considered ''de facto'' banned under the banning policy. [[User:TonyBallioni|TonyBallioni]] ([[User talk:TonyBallioni|talk]]) 19:31, 20 February 2018 (UTC)}}

The current sound file of the national anthem in the article's infobox is [https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AFr-%C3%94_Canada.ogg File:Fr-Ô Canada.ogg], a recording that is over a century old. It has a bitrate of ''100 kilobits'', which, combined with its vocals, makes the melody rather difficult to hear. The entire thing is very out of place, given that a) the vocals are also from the French version of the song rather than the English version, which would be easier to understand for most visitors to the ''English'' Wikipedia, and b) on the infoboxes on articles for other countries, instrumental versions of their anthems seem to be far more common.

There are some alternatives available, but usually whenever someone adds them, they get reverted on the basis that consensus has already been established. Going back through the archives of this talk page, there have indeed been discussions on the issue going back to at least 2012, but it seems to be a very weak consensus. One of the main contenders for the replacement is the higher quality [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_Navy_Band_-_O_Canada.ogg File:United States Navy Band - O Canada.ogg], but this has proven somewhat controversial: see exhibits [[Talk:Canada/Archive_22#Add_Audio_For_Oh_Canada|A]], [[Talk:Canada/Archive_23#Anthem_sound_file|B]], [[Talk:Canada/Archive_23#O_Canada|C]] [[Talk:Canada/Archive_26#O_Canada_audio|D]], among others I'm likely missing.

The other alternative is  [https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AO_Canada.ogg File:O Canada.ogg], a simplistic but recognizable piano version, which existed on the article for some time before it was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canada&diff=prev&oldid=812226946 removed a few months ago] without any explanation, but no longer seems to be [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canada&diff=823229630&oldid=823225247 the de facto replacement] for the US Navy version.

This seems to be a persistent issue that seems to challenge the consensus that has apparently been established so I've decided to open this up to RFC. <span style="background:#000000;">[[User:Cryptic Canadian|'''<span style="color:red;">Cryptic </span>''']] [[User talk:Cryptic Canadian|'''<span style="color:white;">Canadian</span>''']]</span> 03:56, 8 February 2018 (UTC)}}

There's a lot of anime that are dubbed by Funimation's in house studio, and listed on Crunchyroll at the same time. That tends to be the case with simuldubs,  taking [https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-09-08/crunchyroll-funimation-announce-partnership-to-share-content-via-streaming-home-video-est/.106234 their partnership] into consideration. So, what is the point of this topic, really? Currently, there is a user that goes by [[User:TheFarix|The Farix]] that is arguing that [[Talk:Junji Ito Collection|if there is no "license acquisition announcement", then no licensee shall be listed.]] Except, it's common knowledge that a company would not be granted legal dubbing rights UNLESS they bought a license in the first place.

Following the advice from {{u|Robert McClenon}} I'm making this request for comment concerning [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_National_Memo#Several_edits the proposed edits above]. Before making this request I've discussed these changes at the article's Talk page, created the discussion at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Journalism#Help_with_the_National_memo_article Project Journalism] and filed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution_noticeboard#Talk:The_National_Memo#Several_edits dispute resolution request].

I would like third-party view on including proposed edits to the article as we are unable to reach the consensus here, at the Talk page.

''' Summary of the discussion '''

After substantial edits from {{u|Justlettersandnumbers}} an important information describing the media's political stance was removed from the article. The editor first removed the phrase ''predominantly from a liberal perspective'' and changed it to ''predominantly from a left-wing point of view''. When asked to provide solid references, supporting this point of view, he agreed to drop his initial ''left-wing'' claim. As a result of edits from {{u|Spintendo}} the article now doesn't have any information describing the political/editorial stance of [[The National Memo]] as a media. It is important to mention that '''before I made any edits to the article''' it has the following consensus edits result: ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_National_Memo&oldid=786863699 it features daily breaking news and commentary as well as analysis from America's top progressive thinkers from a liberal / progressive perspective]''. I would like to re-instate the truth as both ''liberal'' and ''progressive'' statements are well-supported by references to high-quality third-party sources (unlike other claims such as ''left-wing''). I also think that this information is important to Wikipedia users/readers because after the extensive edits (or rather deletions) from {{u|Justlettersandnumbers}} it is hard to understand what [[The National Memo]] is about. There are several editors (notably {{u|Justlettersandnumbers}} and {{u|Spintendo}} who think that this information should me omitted from the article. - 10:53, 11 February 2018 (UTC)}}

It has always seemed strange to me that we can freely delete articles created by someone banned by the community, but not explicitly for someone banned by the Terms of Use, though G5 could certainly be interpreted in that way. I see two options:

; G5. Creations by banned or blocked users
{{Further|Wikipedia:Banning policy|Wikipedia:Blocking policy|Wikipedia:Terms of use}}
This applies to pages created by [[:Category:Banned Wikipedia users|banned]] or [[:Category:Blocked Wikipedia users|blocked]] users''' either in violation of their [[Wikipedia:Banning policy|ban]] or [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|block]] or by virtue of violation of the Wikimedia Foundation Terms of Use''', and that have no substantial edits by others. G5 should not be applied to [[WP:TRANS|transcluded]] templates or to [[WP:CATEGORY|categories]] that may be useful or suitable for merging. For a banned or blocked user:
* To qualify, an edit or article must have been made while the user was actually banned or blocked. A page created before the ban or block was imposed or after it was lifted will not qualify under this criterion.
* To qualify, the edit must be a violation of the user's specific block or ban. Pages created by a topic-banned user may be deleted if they come under that particular topic, but not if they are legitimately about some other topic.
* {{Tlp|Db-g5|''name of banned user''}}, {{Tlp|Db-banned|''name of banned user''}}

; Gx. Violation of Terms of use
{{Further|Wikipedia:Terms of use}}
This applies to pages created in violation of the [[:Wikimedia:Terms of Use|Wikimedia Foundation terms of use]], and that have no substantial edits by others. 

To qualify, the edit or article must have been made by a user demonstrated or admitted to be in violation of the Terms of Use. Specific categories of violation include:
* Harassing and Abusing Others
* Violating the Privacy of Others
* Engaging in False Statements, Impersonation, or Fraud
* Committing Infringement
* Misusing Our Services for Other Illegal Purposes
* Engaging in Disruptive and Illegal Misuse of Facilities
* Paid contributions without disclosure
The article must have been created by an editor in violation of the terms of use and have no substantive content edits by others.

{{rfcquote|text=
{{collapse bottom}}
Preamble: The majoritarian idea of governance often has the provision that certain majoritarian actions might be infringing on minority groups, which is to say the actions are persecutory, and therefore statutes have to be put in place to either limit majoritarian rampages, or else protect minority interests specifically. 

The RFC to remove the religion= tag from the main infobox might have come about without fair treatment of the minority opinion, and so I propose two things, that the religion= tag be restored and a guideline for its usage be written. In addition, I make the suggestion that Arbcom review the RFC in order to form guidelines to protect minority interests from majoritarian sweeps, such that as in this case, other solutions were not sought or taken. 

On the matter of the RFC and its claimed validity, the validity naturally rests entirely on the idea of it being majoritarian, and a "snow close" issue. But then atheist majoritarianism would have the problem that it would wipe away religion as a topical element from articles project wide, and that has to be prevented, by statue and guideline. 

The internet seems to have a strong showing of atheists and science-culturists, but if science culture is taking the form of an irrational cult religion, and atheism is not really a personal view but an increasingly more organized anti-religion movement, then these things need to be countered with some common sense that rejects POV movements and does honorable treatment of the human condition and the role religion has played in it. -[[User:Inowen|Inowen]] ([[User talk:Inowen|talk]]) 06:15, 15 March 2018 (UTC)}}

I noticed that in the [[:Category:World War II tanks by country]] there's a great differentiation in how the individual articles are named. According to [[WP:NAMINGCRITERIA]]: ''"a title usually conveys what the subject is actually called in English."'' Respectively, in the [[:Category:World War II tanks of the United States]] (which is perhaps the most representative to English language articles on the subject), most articles have the word "tank" included in their titles: [[T14 Heavy Tank]], [[T20 Medium Tank]], [[T28 Super Heavy Tank]], [[T29 Heavy Tank]], [[T30 Heavy Tank]], and so on. By contrast, in the [[:Category:World War II tanks of Japan]] the word "tank" is never (!) used in the title of their models, i.e.: [[Type 1 Chi-He]], [[Type 1 Ho-Ni I]], [[Type 2 Ho-I]], [[Type 2 Ka-Mi]], [[Type 2 Ke-To]], [[Type 3 Chi-Nu]], and so on. I would suggest that some kind of linguistic uniformity here be followed throughout, for the benefit of our readership.

'''Background''': The Kingdom of France as made in the image of [[Hugh Capet]] held at its foundation the practice of [[Salic Law]], manifest in the [[French dynastic disputes|''Arrêt Lemaistre'' and Fundamental Laws of France]], which constituted the monarchical succession for over eight-hundred years. These traditions were immutable and considered vital to the existence of the State. However, the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 abolished this traditional succession, favoring a constitutional alternative that was to re-emerge in the [[July Revolution]] of 1830. This nineteenth-century uprising saw the Bourbon monarchy deposed in favor of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe d'Orléans]] as "King of the French", his realm designated the "French Kingdom", to better associate the government with its people and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|revolutionary reforms]] of 1789.

'''Proposal''': We should divide the Kingdom of France and French Kingdom into two separate articles, drawing clear distinction between the Salic-foundational and [[Charter of 1830|Charte-foundational]] monarchies. This can be realized by relocating all relevant information to the [[July Monarchy]] page.

<sub>NOTE: The [[Kingdom of France (1791–92)| Kingdom of France 1791–92]] would best be described as a government in captivity given that [[Louis XVI]] was incapacitated as a prisoner of circumstance; juxtaposed to the rule of Louis Philippe in 1830, who was free to govern and travel of his own volition, it would not be appropriate to separate the 1791-92 article.</sub><p>- [[User:Conservatrix|Conservatrix]] ([[User talk:Conservatrix|talk]]) 21:30, 3 March 2018 (UTC)}}

The title of the article does not seem to conform to [[WP:COMMMONNAME|the rule about articles' names]]. To remind ourselves of the pertinent passage in the rule, here it is: "''Wikipedia generally prefers the name that is most commonly used (as determined by its prevalence in a significant majority of independent, reliable English-language sources) as such names will usually best fit the [[WP:NAMINGCRITERIA|[naming] criteria]]. ... Wikipedia does not necessarily use the subject's "official" name as an article title; it generally prefers to use the name that is most frequently used to refer to the subject in English-language reliable sources.''"

The name most commonly used by the overwhelming majority of [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] is "the former royal family of Greece" (or equivalent expressions, such as "former royal household"). Typical such citations can be found in the [[BBC]] (e.g. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6289097.stm here]); ''[[Washington Post]]'' ([http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/24/AR2007012401325.html here]); the ''[[National Herald]]'' ([https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/673.pdf here]); [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] News ([http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/christie-s-begins-antiquities-sale-over-objections-of-greece-1.654941 here]); the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', UK  ([http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1535659/Exiled-Greek-royals-sell-off-the-family-silver.html here]); the ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'', Australia ([https://www.escape.com.au/where-the-wealthy-unwind-spetses-paradise-for-the-rich-in-the-greek-islands/news-story/e16d1699e03ac455ae450d411910b6e5 here]); ''[[The Guardian]]'' ([https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/jan/24/art.world here]); all the English-language online editions of newspapers, magazines, and other media in Greece (e.g. [http://greece.greekreporter.com/2010/08/25/european-royals-gather-for-greek-island-wedding%E2%80%8E/ here], [http://en.protothema.gr/former-greek-royal-family-dined-at-the-acropolis-museum/ here], or [http://www.ekathimerini.com/35921/article/ekathimerini/news/culture-ministry-explores-contents-of-old-royal-estate here]). Plus, all English Wikipedia articles concerning members of the family (e.g. about [[Constantine II of Greece]] or [[Tatoi Palace]]) use the term "former".

The historical, official appellation is used mostly by fringe [[royalist]] organizations, media, and political parties (e.g. [http://www.greekroyalfamily.gr/en.html The Greek Royal Family]; [http://www.theroyalforums.com/forums/f24/princes-and-princesses-of-greece-and-denmark-8863.html Royal Forums]; [https://royalcorrespondent.com/category/greek-royal-family/ Royal Correspondent]; etc) or [[gossip magazine]]s, such as ''[[Hello (magazine)|Hello]]'' (see [https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/greek-royal-wedding/ here]) or ''Life & Style'' (e.g. [http://www.lifeandstylemag.com/tags/royal-family-20153 here]).

It is suggested that the title of this article changes accordingly.</br>

A large amount of the text already included shows that the numerous invasions were either defeated, repelled or they were just short opportunistic raids. Wikipedia guidelines on neutrality, POV, bias, due balance, etc are clear. Calling those the "conquests" is POV bias, which lends undue balance to some "wins" against the "numerous" defeats / repulsions /expulsions of muslim invaders by the native hindus/sikhs/buddhists. The contentious namespace, such as the [[Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent]], creates a muslim-supremacist bias. Move the article to a more non-contentious, balanced, fairer, and more accurate non-supremacist namespace, such as the [[Attempted muslim invasions of the Indian subcontinent]] or the [[Muslim invasions of the Indian subcontinent]], etc. [[Special:Contributions/202.156.182.84|202.156.182.84]] ([[User talk:202.156.182.84|talk]]) 13:55, 17 March 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
In [[Talk:Sex#WP:Undue intersex material in the lead|a discussion]] higher up on the article talk page, concern has been expressed about the lead sentence of the article. '''One view''' is that "splitting things into male/female/intersex is far too human centric - far more generally relevant is male/female/hermaphrodite." In a similar vein, there is also sentiment that stating "are specialized into male and female varieties, each known as a sex" makes the article "overly narrowed [...] to be about biological sex, which is far narrower than the subject of the article. This was always intended to be the general article, where the various meanings of sex are explained, distinguished, and linked to." The '''other view''' is that when sources on "sex" are not talking about sexual intercourse/other sexual activity or sociological gender, they are talking about biological/anatomical sex, which are terms that redirect to this article and do not solely concern humans. There are already [[Sexual intercourse]], [[Sexual activity]], [[Sexual reproduction]] and [[Gender]] articles. This article is mainly about biological/anatomical sex. It is not an article for every definition of sex that exists. [[Sex (disambiguation)]] covers that. Per [[WP:Lead sentence]], this article's first sentence should be clear what it's about. 

So which lead sentence should we go with?

'''Option 1''': "[[Organism]]s of many [[species]] are specialized into male and female varieties, each known as a '''sex'''."

'''Option 2''': "[[Sexual reproduction]] involves the combining and mixing of [[genetics|genetic]] traits: specialized [[Cell (biology)|cells]] known as [[gamete]]s combine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent."

'''Option 3''': Some other wording.

I'll alert [[WP:Biology]], [[WP:Physiology]], [[WP:Anatomy]] and [[WP:Med]] to this discussion. Sources are listed in the [[Talk:Sex#Discussion|Discussion]] section below. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 08:42, 18 February 2018 (UTC)}}

The previous RfC on this topic has caused more confusion than it has solved any issues. By not clarifying that the marriage ended upon the death of the subject of the article (although acknowledged in the article itself) causes issues as it implies the marriage has persisted after death. Additionally, if the spouse of the subject were to remarry, if people click around and skip over details it could suggest that the person in question is in two relationships at once which causes a whole stream of issues in itself. The original his death, her death thing was clearer than the layout being suggested by the discussion above. For articles where this is the case see [[Henry_VIII_of_England|Henry VIII]] where it clarifies and does not cause the confusion, a similar example is in [[Robert_Mugabe|Robert Mugabe's]] article. <br>So to summarise, the formatting used in the case of Henry VIII and Robert Mugabe is better than the discussed format above.

The name of the station in Russian is Paveletsky Vokzal ([[ru:Павелецкий вокзал]]. Although the word “station” in Russian is feminine and would take Paveletskaya skaya as a modifier, such as when you refer to a Metro station like [[Paveletskaya (Zamoskvoretskaya line)]] or [[ru:Павелецкая (станция метро, Замоскворецкая линия)]] , when you refer to a major railway terminal such as this, the modifier should refer to the masculine word “Vokzal” and would take Paveletsky. I’m not entirely sure what the logic behind the move to the feminine version was. But I propose to make these linguistically correct. The stations are:
*[[Moscow Kazanskaya railway station]]
*[[Moscow Kiyevskaya railway station]]
*[[Moscow Kurskaya railway station]]
*[[Moscow Paveletskaya railway station]]
*[[Moscow Rizhskaya railway station]]
*[[Moscow Savyolovskaya railway station]]
*[[Moscow Yaroslavskaya railway station]]

Further, on two articles, [[Moscow Passazhirskaya railway station]] and [[Moscow Smolenskaya railway station]] the names don’t even comport to the name of the facility. As far as I can tell, the names used refer to the stop on the rail line. To me this would be like reading a timetable for a train that terminates at New York-Penn Station and naming the article that rather than [[Pennsylvania Station]] as the facility is officially called. I would propose to rename all of the articles after the proper names [[Belorussky railway station]] and [[Leningradsky railway station]].

There is dispute over whether to include psychedelic pop and psychedelic rock in the infobox. The argument for including them is that there are sources supporting them.

We've now [[Talk:Star Wars: The Last Jedi#RfC: Which version of the Audience response section should we go with?|reached consensus on the base version to use for the audience response section]]. It's now time to discuss potential changes. Modifications were suggested to the base text in the RfC; most of these revolved around versions of the text included in version 2. The two options in the RfC were:

'''Version 1/3:'''
<blockquote>Particularly divisive was the reveal that Rey's parents are insignificant;[7][13][15] '''many fans had expected her to be Luke's daughter or to share a lineage with another character from the original trilogy.'''[16][17] There was also sentiment that Snoke's character was underdeveloped '''and that Luke's actions contrasted his previous heroic portrayal'''.[15][18][19] Reviewers stated that fan theories were held so strongly among some viewers that it was difficult for them to accept different stories.[13][15][19] However, other viewers appreciated the film's action, tone and deviation from Star Wars tradition.[13][15]</blockquote>

'''Version 2:'''
<blockquote>Particularly divisive was the reveal that Rey's parents are insignificant;[7][13][15] '''many fans had expected her to share a lineage with another character from the original trilogy'''.[17] There was also sentiment that Snoke's character was underdeveloped '''and disagreement with Luke's portrayal and character arc in whether he was heroic enough'''.[15][18][15][19] Reviewers stated that fan theories were held so strongly among some viewers that it was difficult for them to accept different stories.[13][15][19] However, other viewers appreciated the film's action, tone and deviation from Star Wars tradition.[13][15]</blockquote>

Specifically, the question was whether or not the "Rey is Luke's daughter" fan theory should be mentioned and how to characterize Luke's portrayal. This issue was not decided upon in the RfC; the closer specifically said that .

The question in this RfC, then, is to decide this. '''Should the third paragraph in the audience reception section use the text from Versions 1/3, or the text from version 2'''?

Per [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history#Use of decisive|discussion]] at [[WP:MILHIST]], around issues caused by the use of the terms described below which have led to several disputes and edit warring, I propose the following is added to this page (as a subsection of Usage and style):
<blockquote>
'''Results'''

When describing the outcome of a military event, care needs to be taken to avoid [[Wikipedia:original research|original research]]. Terms like "decisive victory", "marginal victory", "tactical victory" can have different meanings in different sources. For instance, a battle described as decisive may have directly led to the conclusion of the conflict, led to a change in direction of the broader conflict, had a clear tactical outcome on the battlefield with no lasting strategic implications, or a number of other possibilities.

These terms should only be used when they reflect a consensus in relevant [[Wikipedia:reliable sources|reliable sources]]. When these terms are used in articles they should have sufficient context from the surrounding text to make their meaning clear. They may also be used as part of a direct quotation from a specific person. They should not be used in an infobox, as there is no ability to give a broader explanation in that location.
</blockquote>

I believe this draft supports editors in dealing with broader issues around these terms (that different sources can and will use them in different ways), and directly addresses the most problematic uses (in infoboxes).--[[User:Nilfanion|Nilf]][[commons:User:Nilfanion|anion]] ([[User talk:Nilfanion|talk]]) 16:10, 4 March 2018 (UTC)}}

This article comes across as having some obvious [[WP:NPOV]] and [[Weasel word]] issues. I've tried to clean up a couple of sections, but this seems to upset [[user:Pahlevun]], who appears to have monopolized the article. I've tried to take the debate to the article's Talk page, but consensus hasn't been reached with user Pahlevun (though [[user:Icewhiz]] did support proposed changes). I think that at this point we need another neutral editor to have a look at this. What I've found, basically, is that:

1) Biased references are being used to support biased statements (these biased references often seem to be connected to the Iranian regime. As Icewhiz pointed out: Note the Iranian regime (and regime controlled media in Iran) views MEK in a highly negative fashion (MEK being on of the regular "bogeymen" in coverage, regularly assigned blame for various woes). This sometimes seeps into non-Iranian coverage (in proper sources - attributed back to the Iranian regime) - however we should be careful to attribute such negative statements here

2) Other references are being used to support negative statements that are not in the references themselves (see discussion above).

I've tried to discuss this with [[user:Pahlevun]] (see above), but he/she has opted to open an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Atlantic12 SPI case] against me instead. [[User:London Hall|London Hall]] ([[User talk:London Hall|talk]]) 11:25, 24 March 2018 (UTC)}}

* In 1997 "Philedelphia Citypaper" published an interview which said that stiers  was asked if he was gay, and replied  that he was not. {{tq|Are you gay? No, I'm not. But, I believe that we're all the same person differently expressed}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20151014062015/http://citypaper.net/articles/021397/article001.shtml]

* A prior informal RFC was closed without consensus to include [[Talk:David_Ogden_Stiers/Archives/2014]]
* After Stiers death, the story made the rounds again (many sources again), including the NYT obit  (explicitly citing the ABC story above, which cites gossip boy) [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/obituaries/david-ogden-stiers-mash-dies.html] Or see the TimesUK story which uses direct quotes from the blog, but does not cite any sources and uses their own voice.

The subject of this article has been accused of sexual harassment, first in 1983 (after which Harvard disciplined but retained and later promoted him) and very recently, with stories emerging going back for decades alleging inappropriate behavior. Of course some of this material should be in the bio, but I have a disagreement with another editor (or possibly five, although the IP addresses are very similar) about WP:WEIGHT. On the talk page, they are sharply critical of my edits to the article.

The IPs ([[Special:Contributions/2604:2000:E016:A700:8853:2F07:A72D:96A2]], [[Special:Contributions/2604:2000:E016:A700:F81C:D427:6CB1:E49F]], [[Special:Contributions/2604:2000:E016:A700:14D7:F45B:2E06:DDDC]], [[Special:Contributions/2604:2000:E016:A700:E1FD:CB3E:641B:795B]], [[Special:Contributions/2604:2000:E016:A700:FDB2:3234:2AAA:AB32]]) have been editing this article aggressively to add all possible references for the sex scandal, including transforming one Harvard Crimson article into 3, and citing both one Newsweek article and its absolute duplicate in Yahoo. 

I think that the number of overlapping references, the paragraph they added to the header, and the accusatory tone of the Sexual harassment section, are inappropriate to WP:WEIGHT and BLP. It will be better to have one sentence at most in the header, with maybe three paragraphs in the body, including links to articles where interested people can read the detailed salacious claims against the subject. 

I am not trying to whitewash the subject. What he is accused of is reprehensible and claims against him are news. But unless I am wrong, the amount of space and detail spent describing these claims should have some balance with the amount of space the article spends describing his notability. What do others think? Thanks! [[User:HouseOfChange|HouseOfChange]] ([[User talk:HouseOfChange|talk]]) 04:00, 11 March 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Preamble: The majoritarian idea of governance often has the provision that certain majoritarian actions might be infringing on minority groups, which is to say the actions are persecutory, and therefore statutes have to be put in place to either limit majoritarian rampages, or else protect minority interests specifically. 

The RFC to remove the religion= tag from the main infobox might have come about without fair treatment of the minority opinion, and so I propose two things, that the religion= tag be restored and a guideline for its usage be written. In addition, I make the suggestion that Arbcom review the RFC in order to form guidelines to protect minority interests from majoritarian sweeps, such that as in this case, other solutions were not sought or taken. 

On the matter of the RFC and its claimed validity, the validity naturally rests entirely on the idea of it being majoritarian, and a "snow close" issue. But then atheist majoritarianism would have the problem that it would wipe away religion as a topical element from articles project wide, and that has to be prevented, by statute and guideline. 

The internet seems to have a strong showing of atheists and science-culturists, but if science culture is taking the form of an irrational cult religion, and atheism is not really a personal view but an increasingly more organized anti-religion movement, then these things need to be countered with some common sense that rejects POV movements and does honorable treatment of the human condition and the role religion has played in it. -[[User:Inowen|Inowen]] ([[User talk:Inowen|talk]]) 06:15, 15 March 2018 (UTC)}}

 There has been an ongoing dispute over which images should be used in this list, involving experienced editors and newer editors, registered and IP users, those acting with good intentions and with those with more dubious reasons. The page was temporarily protected a few times, but has now been protected for a full year. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States&oldid=830687047 This] is the current version of the article as of the posting of this RfC. There are 44 men representing 45 presidencies, Grover Cleveland is listed twice, using the same image. The purpose of this RfC is to establish consensus, for the images that should be included as if it's closing, and to establish that changes to images must be proposed on the talk page first and only implemented with consensus, or are otherwise immediately reverted. 
*Question 1: Do you support the current 44 images [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States&oldid=830687047 currently] listed?
**If you oppose, please indicate which image(s) you want to see changed, including a link to the replacement image(s) you are proposing and your reasoning. We'll have a straw poll for each image. 
*Question 2: Do you support that any changes to images must first be proposed on the talk page and only implemented with consensus?  
At the conclusion of this RfC, we should have a set list of 44 (or 45) images and going forward, (hopefully) have a mechanism in place to prevent any further disruption to the page. [[User:Thewolfchild|wolf]] 16:50, 16 March 2018 (UTC)}}

{{shortcut|WP:FPORTALS}}
On 8 April 2018, a '''[[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)|village pump proposal]]''' was submitted that proposed '''deleting Wikipedia's various [[Wikipedia:Portals|portals]]'''. The discussion quickly became very complex, involving a number of counter-proposals, and many points were repeated several times in the discussion thread. The discussion was therefore [[WP:BOLD|boldly]] closed and sequestered out to this page by [[User:Newbiepedian|Newbiepedian]] at the original suggestion of [[User:John Cline|John Cline]] in order to restructure it and provide an accessible overview to the discussion that has already taken place. This will help encourage discussion of the individual proposals.

The original discussion has been archived '''[[/RFC|here]]'''.

{{toclimit|3}}

= Background =
:''This section is not gospel, please feel free to amend if you feel anything is inaccurate or insufficiently comprehensive.''

The original proposal suggested deleting all portals.

The main arguments in '''support''' of the proposal were:
# Very few Wikipedians use portals, and therefore very few Wikipedians maintain them.
# As very few Wikipedians maintain portals, they often contain out-of-date and/or irrelevant information.
# Many portals on certain subjects are less useful as an introduction to their subject than the main article(s).
# The time Wikipedians ''do'' spend on maintaining portals would (thus) be better spent on maintaining articles.

The main arguments in '''opposition''' to the proposal were:
# Although few Wikipedians use portals, many visitors do. (See table below to that effect.)
# Blanket deletion of an entire namespace, containing a total of 185,578 pages, may have many unintended consequences &ndash; as mass deletions have done in the past.
# There are clearly some portals that ''are'' well-maintained, such as [[Portal:Current events]], and there is little reason to delete them.
# Some value would (thus) be lost by deleting all portals. An overhaul, by contrast, could potentially create value.

A large amount of the text already included shows that the numerous invasions were either defeated, repelled or they were just short opportunistic raids. Wikipedia guidelines on neutrality, POV, bias, due balance, etc are clear. Calling those the "conquests" is POV bias, which lends undue balance to some "wins" against the "numerous" defeats / repulsions /expulsions of muslim invaders by the native hindus/sikhs/buddhists. The contentious namespace, such as the [[Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent]], creates a muslim-supremacist bias.

There is disagreement over the DoB of the subject. The majority of sources seem to point to 1976, but may themselves be based on the wikipedia article, so there's potentially a feedback loop here. The article's original creator proposes a 1975 date but without reliable source.  There was significant edit warring and disruptive editing/vandalism  early in this article's history that is potentially the source of the confusion.[[User:Heliotom|Heliotom]] ([[User talk:Heliotom|talk]]) 10:29, 19 March 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
In  April 2011, the community  reached  a [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Proposal to require autoconfirmed status in order to create articles|large consensus by  RfC]] for a 6  month  trial limiting  the creation  of articles in  mainspace by  non-[[WP:Autoconfirmed|autoconfirmed]] users. In June 2017 after discussions with the English Wikipedia community, the Wikimedia Foundation agreed that such a trial would be implemented. On 14 September 2017, the Wikimedia Foundation implemented the [[Wikipedia:Autoconfirmed article creation trial|Autoconfirmed article creation trial]] (commonly referred to as ACTRIAL) and it ended on 14 March 2018 after 6 months. The results of the research can be found at '''[[meta:Research:Autoconfirmed article creation trial]]''' and '''[[Wikipedia:Autoconfirmed article creation trial/Post-trial Research Report]]'''. Three of the major themes of the report were that:
#New user activity and retention is largely unaffected
#Creation of pages by new users shifted to draft space from article space
#Fewer low-quality and inappropriate  pages have been created in article space

The [[meta:Research:Autoconfirmed article creation trial|independent consultant's research]] generally shows that the concerns (hypotheses) that were raised before the trial about the restrictions having a negative impact on retention of new editors did not occur, the trial and the research conducted has received generally positive feedback. 

Following the trial, and in view of the promise to the community that the rule will not be permanently installed without a further discussion, it is proposed that as from 3 May 2018, (or sooner if a consensus is reached): 

'''Creation of new articles in the main space is restricted to accounts that have reached autoconfirmed status (four days registered and at least ten edits).'''

The article has NPOV issues. A lot of it seems to be coming from manipulation of references, for instance:

{{tq| * “In a 2004 public release, Amnesty International stated it continues to receive reports of human rights violations carried out by the MEK against its own members.[194]” }}

The Amnesty International statement actual says the contrary, that the Iranian regime tortured a suspected MEK member.

In other instances, sources [http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/international/319141-americans-must-be-wary-of-irans-influence-over-us-media funded by the Iranian Regime] are being used. This creates NPOV issues as the Iranian Regime considers this group one of its [https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tehrans-futile-attempts-at-discrediting-the-cause-for-regime-change-in-iran/article/2641728 main political threats]. The following was published by the Brookings Institution, who receives funds to [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/21/npr-funding-iran-nuclear-deal-ploughshares publish on behalf of the Iranian Regime]:

{{tq| * “Members who defected from the MEK and some experts say that these Mao-style self-criticism sessions are intended to enforce control over sex and marriage in the organization as a total institution.[184]” }}

In the past, Windows Server was not included in the list becasue it wasn't updated as a continuous release as was Windows 10 & Windows 10 mobile.

There was only Windows Server 2016, and it was akin to Windows 7, Windows Vista, Server 2008 RT, etc. But now, it's different.

Server has now adopted the Software as a service model and has aligned itself with Windows 10 client. There's now RS3, RS4, and RS5 releases either public or scheduled.

There needs to be a consensus on whether server should be included.

There's mobile version history. Why not server.

Thoughts, please.

This article contains coverage of EU sanctions that were brought against the article's subject, Vladimir Peftiev, and enforced from portions of 2011 through 2014. Peftiev brought legal challenge against the sanctions and in Decemeber 2014, the Council of the European Union (the same body which imposed the sanctions) voided them.  While some discussion of these facts has been present in the article since 2016, there is now a dispute as to how much coverage these events should receive in the article; recent edits have considerably expanded the coverage of the criticisms section--not just with regard to the sanctions, but also additional related allegations which have been made against Peftiev. Other editors have advocated against this additional content. The span of perspectives is reasonably captured by the following two drafts: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vladimir_Peftiev&oldid=829311329 fleshed-out criticism section], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vladimir_Peftiev&oldid=828504540 a more conservative criticism section].

Advocates for the minimalist approach have argued that recently added content is based on sourcing which is either unreliable or insufficient to support the new content, given the increased burden which must be met for [[WP:EXCEPTIONAL]] claims.  They further argue that, even putting the source reliability aside, some of this content may over-emphasize accusations which are [[WP:UNDUE]] under our weight policies, given the circumstances and the fact that the EU has explicitly annulled the sanctions against Peftiev.  Advocates for the inclusionist perspective disagree and find the sources both reliable and appropriate to the claims they support, and argue that the coverage of additional allegations against Peftiev (some related to the sanctions, some not) is both [[WP:DUE]] and [[WP:PROPORTION]]AL. Your input is requested on the following questions:

1) Which of the following sources are appropriate or inappropriate for use in the context they would be utilized for in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vladimir_Peftiev&oldid=831067416 the current version of the article]?

2) Given your perspective on question #1, which statements do you feel are unsupported and should be removed?

We apologize that this RfC does not give respondents a clearer question to !vote up or down, but your input as to the underlying issue of which sources are or are not reliable for the claims they currently support could be very useful in breaking this deadlock, thank you!

Sometime ago, {{Article|Fauxcest}} was merged with {{Article|Incest pornography}}. The rationale behind this was [[WP:NEO]], [[WP:POVFORK]] and that the Fauxcest article was not much bigger than the section on Fauxcest at the Incest pornography article. An IP has challenged this. The IP somewhat expanded the article, and has argued that "stepfamily is non-consanguineous" and that "we could rename [the article] to pseudo-incest." A counterargument is that that "fauxcest" mainly concerns pornography, sexual activity between step-siblings is still referred to as [[incest]], and the current version of the article contains some [[WP:Synthesis]].

In closing the [[ Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Civility in infobox discussions|Civility in infobox discussions]] arbitration case, the Arbitration committee [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Civility_in_infobox_discussions#Community_discussion_recommended|recommended]] {{tq|...well-publicized community discussions be held to address whether to adopt a policy or guideline addressing what factors should weigh in favor of or against including an infobox in a given article and how those factors should be weighted.}} As an editor who has not previously been involved in favor or against infobox usage and therefore a (hopefully) neutral party, I'm opening this discussion here. [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Infoboxes#Community_discussion_recommended|A prior call for discussion]] did not clarify standards for infobox usage. That leaves two policy questions in this latest recommendation: 
#Are infoboxes necessary for articles generally
#How editors decide if infoboxes are necessary on particular articles
It seems logical to decide the first before the second. 

The spectrum of options for the first question logically runs from "infoboxes everywhere" to "infoboxes nowhere". [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Infoboxes#Use_of_infoboxes|The previous infobox Arbitration decision]], however, found that: {{tq|[t]he use of infoboxes is neither required nor prohibited for any article by site policies or guidelines.}} The extreme policy options of "every article should have an infobox" and "no article should have an infobox" are therefore not offered as options here. The spectrum of remaining options is:
*Infoboxes are used by default on most articles – removing one from an article with one requires talk page consensus
*Infoboxes are used by default on broad class(es) of articles (e.g., biographies, biological species, etc.) – removing one from an article with one requires talk page consensus (Note: the obverse is therefore also true, articles not in the defined class(es) by default omit infoboxes.)

Wikiprojects would be the most logical place to determine which articles come under the "broad classes" and "some more-restricted subset" options, where active projects exist.

'''''Request to !voters:''''' To assist the future closers of this RfC in assessing consensus on so many options, it is requested that editors ''only'' place a '''support''' !vote in the subsection below that most closely aligns with their preferred option.  '''Oppose''' !votes are ''not necessary'' and should be assumed for the remaining other options. I recognize that this "support only one option" request eliminates nuanced views but this is by design.  Previous discussions have not yielded much clarity, so clarity is preferred here over nuance.  Discussions to determine the exact parameters of the selected option, as well as question #2 listed above, will be presented later. Thank you in advance for your help.

The question is: what should and should not be included in the infobox? The infobox apparently should be a condensed form of all the important information in the article. As there was recently an edit war over whether the extended family members are notable enough to be mentioned in the infobox or not, I decided to open an RfC and ask for the opinions of other users. The ones that are currently listed under that parameter are the president's parents, grandparents and uncle (who are deceased), his former wives (whom Donald Trump obviously is not married to anymore), and his siblings who are not as prominent as his wife and children. Adding their names also makes the infobox look oversized. I would like to see what the other users think about it. <span style="font:'Pristina'">[[user:Keivan.f|<span style="color: #1E7HDC">Keivan.f</span>]]</span><span style="font:'Pristina'"><sup>[[user_talk:Keivan.f|<span style="color: purple">Talk</span>]]</sup></span> 01:18, 30 March 2018 (UTC)}}

Request for comments. What should the 'development status' parameter be set to in the article's infobox.
:'''A''' - Moribund
:'''B''' - Low activity
:'''C''' - Stalled
:'''D''' - Slowed
:'''E''' - <empty> (indicating the project is Active per [[Template:Infobox software]])
:'''F''' - <something else>

The discussion was getting long and it needed a vertical break. While doing this, I think it would be an appropriate time to ask about suggested options.

To summarize, the documentation seems to only offer the option of "stalled" for us, since the other options (planned, unmaintained, discontinued, abandonware) are not appropriate. It is by definition, not under active development. Two additional options are "low activity" and keeping at "Moribund". I prefer the current option and my next choice would be low activity, and then stalled, but that doesn't accurately represent its development status.

{{shortcut|WP:RFC/ECP}}
One of the points of feedback on the recent [[Wikipedia:Autoconfirmed article creation trial|autoconfirmed account creation trial]] has been that some Wikimedians who work in GLAM and outreach activities to conduct edit-a-thons and trainings felt that the trial negatively impacted their ability to bring in new members of the Wikimedia community. In order to help meet these concerns, I am proposing that a new <code>eventcoordinator</code> user permission be created with the following abilities and guidelines for use and granting:
#The {{code|eventcoordinator}} user group will receive the ability to temporarily add {{code|+confirmed}} to newly created accounts, and will also receive the {{code|(noratelimit)}} right in order to help with account creation. This will allow the Confirmed new accounts to create mainspace pages without waiting 4 days and 10 edits and allow the creation of many new accounts from the same IP address.
#Event coordinators should set the expiry time of the confirmed user right to no more than ten days from the time it is granted. 
#Administrators should only permanently grant the {{code|eventcoordinator}} user right to editors with an established record of editing on Wikipedia. Administrators may at their discretion temporarily grant the permission to editors who are organizing outreach events but do not have significant experience on Wikipedia. Users who have not edited in over a year may have the permission removed for inactivity.
#Event coordinators should only confirm users who actually participate in an outreach event.

[[FC Steaua București]], the most notable football club from Romania, lost its name and logo following some Romanian Justice Court decisions and became "Fotbal Club FCSB" in early 2017.<ref name="steaua_change_name_to_fcsb">{{cite web|url= http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/article/2017/03/31/steaua-bucharest-change-name-fc-fcsb|title=Steaua Bucharest change name to FC FCSB|publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]|date=31 March 2017|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Romanian Army, which had owned the club until 1998 and is still in charge of several sport clubs, "restarted" its football department ([[CSA Steaua București (football)]]) in the summer of that year and commenced play in the fourth league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prosport.ro/fotbal-intern/si-au-pus-antrenor-acum-aduc-jucatorii-lacatus-pana-la-jumatatea-lunii-iulie-vrem-sa-incepem-pregatirea-cu-25-26-de-jucatori-16212918|title=Şi-au pus antrenor, acum aduc jucătorii. Lăcătuş: "Până la jumătatea lunii iulie, vrem să începem pregătirea cu 25-26 de jucători"|trans-title=They named a head coach, now they bring players. Lăcătuş: "Until mid-July, we wish to start the training with 25-26 players"|language=Romanian|publisher=[[Pro Sport]]|date=29 March 2017|accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref>

As of now, FCSB is credited as the successor of FC Steaua by both [[UEFA]] and the Romanian Professional League (LPF), owning 26 domestic titles and 1 [[UEFA Champions League]], among others. This is very easy to verify by checking FCSB's UEFA.com profile.<ref name=uefa>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/teamsandplayers/teams/club=50065/profile/index.html|title=Profile: Fotbal Club FCSB|publisher=UEFA.com|date=|access-date=1 November 2017}}</ref> However, the fans of the fourth league club CSA Steaua claim that their club has 21 league trophies and the UCL from 1989, which has not been confirmed by any reliable source (UEFA, LPF or the Romanian Justice Court). Currently, they have only won the right to use the "Steaua" brand, and the process about the honours has been only been opened in December 2017 and it will take several years to resolve, probably.<ref name="honours">{{cite web|url=http://www.ziare.com/fcsb/stiri-fcsb/csa-steaua-a-dat-in-judecata-fcsb-talpan-vrea-sa-l-lase-pe-becali-si-fara-palmaresul-stelei-1495100|title=CSA Steaua a dat in judecata FCSB: Iata ce scrie in dosarul depus la Tribunalul Bucuresti|trans-title=CSA Steaua sued FCSB: See what is written in the file submitted at the Justice Court of Bucharest|publisher=Ziare|date=29 December 2017|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref>

Despite this, [[User:TPTB]] called me a "vandal" when I added this sentence on the CSA Steaua page: "''However, according to UEFA, FCSB is the successor of Steaua and they hold the records of the former club, including the European Champions Cup won in 1986.''" He also changed the link from [[Template:UEFA Champions League winners]] and it seems nobody is doing anything to resolve this issue for more than one year.

I suggest removing the honours of the club on this article and most of its content which is copy-pasted from FC Steaua Bucuresti, until either a Court Decision or UEFA shows that FCSB lost its right to have the records of Steaua. User:TPTB argues that CSA also won the honours in Court, but this is false:
*The files for CSA to gain the honours have been submitted at the Court only in December 2017, as I said earlier<ref name="honours"/>
*The links he provides only contain statements made by people affiliated with CSA, not any OFFICIAL decisions. 
He also called me a "liar" on multiple occasions for trying to resolve this issue.

I was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Competence_is_required&diff=next&oldid=838100149 reverted] on the basis that 'many editors' have a 'huge problem' with that page, and that it should not reflect any sort of community backing.

There has been much debate on this talk page about the inclusion of a rape allegation. Does this proposed addition address it in a way that is consistent with Wikipedia's guidelines, especially WP:BLP and WP:UNDUE?

My view: BLP rules allow for the publication of an alleged event that is based on uncontentious and well sourced material that is cited and easily verified and where no undue weight is placed on it. As such, it was positioned at the bottom of the wiki, it was made clear that it was an allegation, the sources were cited with links, the sources were reputable, the story lasted longer than a week (one year, but also a 2015-16 biography) and the subject (Shorten) himself addressed the allegations, as well as the police, the alleged victim and Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]]. Many wiki pages of living persons discuss allegations: [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Don Burke]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] to name a few.

I would like to ask editors whether this article lead should include Ba'athist Syria as one of the common names of the Syrian Arab Republic. Currently it is still a consensus that [[Syria]] refers to the [[Syrian Arab Republic]], which is a unitary geopolitical entity (state) ruled by the al-Assad dynasty on behalf of the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Syria-based Ba'ath Party]], which is ruling Syrian Arab Republic since the 1963 coup d'etat. In a very similar case for Iraq during the Ba'athist period 1968-2003 the country article is named [[Ba'athist Iraq]]. Furthermore, ''Ba'athist Syria'' is a very common term in media and scholar literature to refer to the Ba'ath ruled Syrian Arab Republic's territory, population and military (see [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=l5NODwAAQBAJ&pg=PP31&lpg=PP31&dq=%22ba%27athist+syria%22&source=bl&ots=5Fz2fqmty3&sig=I58Igyfq6CFBwjs0BITfAfuPUNo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij0evLs7zaAhVGWCwKHaJXB4E4ChDoAQgmMAA#v=onepage&q=%22ba'athist%20syria%22&f=false Quicksilver War: Syria, Iraq and the Spiral of Conflict 2018],[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9781137397720_4 Class and Capitalism in Syria 2016],[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=PJGd5wZBNH0C&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=%22ba%27athist+syria%22&source=bl&ots=ycPGEOdR0t&sig=U2FDLhr9xMn8o38Zhic6RJxKx10&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7uY6stLzaAhVSJ1AKHYYXArQ4FBDoAQgsMAE#v=onepage&q=%22ba'athist%20syria%22&f=false Everyday Arab Identity: The Daily Reproduction of the Arab World 2013],[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=J3PsAb1uV94C&pg=PA148&lpg=PA148&dq=%22ba%27athist+syria%22&source=bl&ots=5rRle7wlg1&sig=1kBXELb3nGMdNXax3h-HMNS7lW0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij0evLs7zaAhVGWCwKHaJXB4E4ChDoAQhAMAU#v=onepage&q=%22ba'athist%20syria%22&f=false Greater Syria: The History of an Ambition 1992]), to differentiate it from pre-1963 Syrian Republic and from other modern Syrian entities of the Syrian Civil War, such as [[North Syria Federation]] and [[Syrian Opposition]] (rebel members also often use ''Syrian Arab Republic'' as self-designated descriptory term).

Perhaps the look is not uncharacteristic of the subject. I don't know. Granted: No type glamor shot, if avoidable, should be resorted to. An encyclopedia isn't intended to be promotional (''Cf.''

Maybe a shot like the one currently in the infobox might be the most appropriate; Ms. Loesch appears to be captured grimacing in it, its having been chosen with a rationale similar to that for the oft editorial choice of the iconic snapshot of Winston Churchill: a candid shot that seems iconographically apropos given the subject's public persona? Hmm: Maybe this one of Loesch wouldn't be out of place in heroic statuary, sculpted in some earlier era...representing the noble American Indian princess, emoting in contempt at the desecration of her people's lands; but, I digress.

Background: there's been a long-standing issue with this article over whether to include the "Golden Snitch" nickname. Previous discussions have not established a consensus to include it. The nickname originates from a comedy sketch, and other than the comedy sketch, it has had two other mentions cited: a podcast detailed above and one article recently found by {{u|UserHerName}}.

This then leads to two questions:

*Is the nickname sufficiently notable to include in the ''lead'' of the article; and
*Is the nickname sufficiently notable to include in the article ''at all''.

EDIT: Adding a quick signature here, since I hadn't realised the RfC bot stops transcluding at the first sig.

{{rfcquote|text=
In the last months, user The Transhumanist has changed the [[WP:SORTKEY]] for many outline articles from "asterisk" to "space". For example, see here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Outline_of_mining&diff=prev&oldid=827522284] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Outline_of_water&type=revision&diff=827523483&oldid=827482008], and many similar edits were made by him, see list [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&offset=20180225235959&limit=500&contribs=user&target=The+Transhumanist&namespace=&tagfilter=&start=2018-02-25&end=2018-02-25]. Note, "Outline of mining" is not a main article for {{category|Mining}}. Only [[Mining]] is a main article for this category. The articles typically called "History of X" ("Types of X", "List of X", "Outline of X") should be categorized with asterisk, per [[WP:SORTKEY]]. 

From [[WP:SORTKEY]]: ''The main article/s of a category, if existent, should get sorted with a space as key so that it/they appear at the very top of the category. Example: <code><nowiki>[[Category:Example| ]]</nowiki></code> Those articles are typically homonymous or at least synonymous to their category. Furthermore other general articles that are highly relevant to the category should be sorted with an asterisk as key so that they also appear at the top of a category but beneath the main article/s. Example: <code><nowiki>[[Category:Example|*]]</nowiki></code> Those articles are typically called "History of example", "Types of example", "List of example" or similar''.

I think, it's a very bad situation when "Outline of X" is located '''above''' the main "X" article in the related category. See {{Category|Wine}} for example, [[Outline of wine]] is located above [[Wine]]. The readers want to see the main article first, not "outline" of something else, so space as a sortkey should be used for only one main article (in most cases). I ask to restore the correct categorization with "asterisk" for all outline articles.

adding new RfC template per original post by User:Daask (his nomination quote is below; I added to RfC due to only a few participants in this discussion since it was started in December)

I suggest this article be merged with [[Night-watchman state]]. I see that this has been proposed before in 2011 ([[Talk:Night-watchman_state#Why_is_this_separate_from_minarchism?|here]] and [[Talk:Night-watchman_state#Merger_Proposal|here]]), where they were distinguished between an article on a kind of state and the political philosophy which advocates for this state. I am unimpressed by this distinction.</br>
In my opinion, political philosophies are only worthy of their own articles when they become broader movements with multiple policies, reforms, or structures for which they advocate. [[Libertarianism]], [[Communism]], [[Anarchism]], and [[Socialism]] are good examples of this. Minarchism is nothing more or less than the theory and advocacy of the night-watchman state. It has no additional policies, reforms, or structures beyond this one concept. Accordingly, it seems only appropriate to merge.</br>
What do others think?

CAA brought a highly unusual private prosecution against Alison Chabloz. Ms Chabloz disputes the inclusion and characterisation of this content, specifically: she disputes that she is accused of antisemitic acts but instead the charges relate to "grossly offensive" words, stating that "{{tq|Wikipedia is supposedly independent of mainstream media. What's the point of an independent outlet that simply parrots mainstream soundbites?
}}" and denigrating the coverage as {{tq|moronic mainstream media articles}}; she asserts that she should be described as a musician not a blogger, and that the term blogger is a deliberate insult; she insists that she should be called a "holocaust revisionist" not a "holocaust denier". The following questions appear to be germane:
# Should the private prosecution be included?
# Should the target of the prosecution be described as a "blogger" per [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-43321482 Blogger claims "no proof" gas chambers killed Jewish people] (BBC), [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/blogger-alison-chabloz-sings-along-to-antisemitic-song-survivors-in-court-x5l0k7m7d Blogger Alison Chabloz sings along to antisemitic song (((Survivors))) in court] (The Times), [http://www.itv.com/news/2018-01-11/blogger-mocked-anne-frank-and-holocaust-survivors-court-told/ Blogger 'mocked Anne Frank and Holocaust survivors', court told] (ITV)?
# Should the target of the prosecution be characterised as antisemitic, per [http://courtnewsuk.co.uk/judge-considering-verdict-on-antisemitic-songwriter/ Court News] and the other RS listed above?
# Should the target of the prosecution be characterised as a [[holocaust revisionist]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-42637888 'Holocaust revisionist'] in scare quotes as per the BBC, or a [[holocaust denier]]?
# Should the target of the prosecution be named, as per [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/blogger-alison-chabloz-sings-along-to-antisemitic-song-survivors-in-court-x5l0k7m7d Blogger Alison Chabloz sings along to antisemitic song (((Survivors))) in court] (Times headline), [https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/blogger-alison-chabloz-who-is-accused-of-posting-anti-news-photo/903236526#/blogger-alison-chabloz-who-is-accused-of-posting-antisemitic-songs-on-picture-id903236526 Getty Images caption], and the body of all the mainstream sources?
# Should sources such as Jewish Times be included?
# Should Wikipedia suppress mention of this case as ''sub judice''?

'''Options'''

* I would say: '''yes it should be mentioned''', it is widely covered in the media and is a highly unusual private prosecution, possibly even the first of its kind - the issue of [[WP:BLPCRIME]] does not properly apply because the facts at issue are not in serious dispute. This is not a question of "did X do Y" but of "X admittedly did Y, was it a crime or not?"; '''yes we should use the word blogger''' but am not opposed to "and musician" if RS can be found (noting in passing that Google turns up pretty much nothing about her music other than this case); '''yes we should say antisemitic''' - the BBC is representative in saying ''accused of broadcasting "grossly offensive" anti-Semitic songs on the internet'', the two categories are not exclusive, but I have no problem including "grossly offensive and antisemitic" if that seems fairer; '''holocaust denier''' is the correct term per [[WP:WEASEL]] (and indeed revisionist is a redirect to denier); '''Yes we should name the target''' because all the mainstream sources do, sometimes in the headlines, and, more importantly, not only the pro-Jewish sites but also a large number of supportive non-RS sources also use her name, e..g. "[http://www.politicsforum.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=108&t=55964 The Persecution of Alison Chabloz]", "[http://boinnk.nl/143337/blood-libel-the-ritual-persecution-of-alison-chabloz/ Blood Libel: The Ritual Persecution of Alison Chabloz]" and so on - this also extends to several neo-Nazi sites, it's pretty clear that whatever the cause of her name being out there linked to this case, Wikipedia is not part of it, and indeed if we can't mention the name we arguably can't even cite some of the sourcees because it's in (e.g.) The Times article title; '''No''' we should not be including sources like the Jewish Times, they have an obvious bias and we have no need of them since we have much better sources for any content we might plausibly include; '''No''' Wikipedia can mention the case as long as we stick to what the mainstream media says, because the sources we quote have large legal departments and are quite well aware of what can be reported and what can't, we have no need to second-guess them. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 07:27, 18 May 2018 (UTC)}}

I have added tags for clarification and citation of this assertion, but another editor has removed the tags. (See the discussion above this RfC.)  Rather than continue a fruitless dispute, I encourage the opinion of other editors.  Should the article contain this assertion without explaining which views were rejected?

{{rfcquote|text=
Following the advice given to me on the Dispute Resolution Page with respect to the immediately preceding section of this Talk page, I am now submitting a Request for Comments about whether this page on riot shields should clarify that, even if it is true that riot shields somehow encourage people at some psychological level to throw projectiles at the police, it is illegal in pretty much all jurisdictions to do so, and in many jurisdictions it is seriously illegal (that is, a felony).  I think the above exchange makes it clear what the matter of contention is, so I'm not going to rehash all that - but I do want to make clear that one editor offered the possibility of putting on the page something that does acknowledge this in presumably less tendentious language that people felt I was offering, and there is no reason that can't be done, whatever one thinks of my own approach to attempting those edits.  Don't snatch disagreement out of the jaws of agreement.  To my knowledge, no one is challenging the fact that jurisdictions generally do not allow the throwing of projectiles at the police, or indeed, at anyone else.  The debate was about whether it is necessary to say this here.  I don't understand why people are so dogmatically opposing one sentence that can clarify that Wikipedia is not treating illegal assaults on the police like they are not a big legal deal.  The best argument I have heard is that the sentence strikes people as unnecessary because it is presumed people already know that, but I suspect outside the small ecosystem of this page, there are people who might prefer the language were in there because people might indeed not know what it is assumed they know.

In light of new developments in the portal namespace, it is time for new and improved portal guidelines. These guidelines will help guide the updating and ongoing maintenance of the portal namespace.

The [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Portal_guidelines&oldid=718250697 in-situ guidelines] were written in 2012, and have proven inadequate for guiding the creation and maintenance of portals. In addition, some parts of the guidelines were too restrictive and inhibited the evolution of portal design.  

As such we have removed mandatory design elements from the draft policy, and intend to add those (less imperatively) into [[Wikipedia:Portal/Instructions|the instructions]].

The new guidelines are intended to be sufficient to guard against unacceptable low quality portals, while not prejudicing against innovation (or already established markup). They will also guide editors into using the new transclusion templates to avoid content forks.

In short, this is a proposal to replace [[Wikipedia:Portal guidelines|this]] with the content of [[User:Cesdeva/sandbox11|this]] (minus the notices).

{{rfcquote|text=
Picture this, each DOY usually has about 200-300 lines. Imagine referencing every single line in a DOY, you will have a ref of another 200-300 lines, a mirror for each content. Each DOY will blow its size 2 times the original size.

I think it is extremely redundant and unnecessary. The original rule (before the changes on October 17, 2017) is that there is no need to place ref to every single line in DOY, as long as the ref is provided in the linked main article. It has always been like this for 10+ years. I respect the proposed intention, however, is this really achievable (given the extreme dynamics of the DOY articles)? is the pressure for compliance really worth it? would it help? 366 DOY each with 200-300 lines means 109,800 new refs should be added, which IMO is extremely redundant given each content actually already well-referenced in the linked main article in the first place (with multi-refs!). What will happen if the project stops in the middle just because we couldn't cope with the dynamic changes usually associated with DOY articles?

In my opinion, the task list of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Days_of_the_year#Task_list Ensure each article has <nowiki>==References== </nowiki>{{tlx|reflist}} added] in the project page is very difficult to be implemented and would introduce major changes in the entire 366 DOY article as well as potential inconsistency throughout the 366 DOY articles for a long period of time. This is the first major change for 366 wiki articles after a decade.

To be honest, I proposed to have the rule of ''Ensure each article has References (reflist) added'' removed. I think it doesn't make sense and would cause quite a mess in the run. Now I just read it (I missed it!), I actually strongly oppose the proposal of [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Days_of_the_year#Exemption_from_WP:V|Exemption from WP:V]] discussed above. It would create a big burden to whoever responsible for completing this not enforceable project. As you may all know, each of the DOY articles is one of the most dynamic articles in Wikipedia, it is keep changed by random users on every single day. 

What are your opinions? Is this "project" of referencing really worth it? Let's open discussion for the sake of improvement?--[[User:Rochelimit|Rochelimit]] ([[User talk:Rochelimit|talk]]) 15:46, 16 May 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Recent votes in various MfD discussions seem to indicate that there is a lack of consensus as to when it is appropriate to delete drafts and userpages. It seems to me that a large cause of the lack of consensus is ambiguity in the policies that address these issues, including [[WP:CSD]], [[WP:STALE]], and [[WP:UP]]. The lack of clarity is resulting in editors making wildly varied arguments, and while some of this is natural, the degree to which this is the case at MfD greatly exceeds that at AfD or RfD, for example. Furthermore, these variations seem to some degree to be the result of disagreements of philosophy, particularly about what the purpose the userspace serves, what purpose drafts serve, what purpose sandboxes serve, when deletion is appropriate, and numerous others. In order to shed light on this issue, I have compiled a list of questions which I hope will delve to the heart of this issue, that our discussion of them may shed light on these issues.

This is not a policy proposal, although discourse here may demonstrate the need for another RfC to propose policy. Rather, I wish to gather the opinions of various editors on the following questions. Some have more obvious answers than others, but I believe all to be worth asking and considering:

#What is (or should be) the difference between a [[Wikipedia:Draft space|draftspace]] draft and a [[Wikipedia:User pages|userspace]] draft?
##What is the benefit of distinguishing between the draftspace and the userspace for [[WP:CSD#G13|CSD G13]], and should CSD G13 be revised in any way to change its scope?
#What standards and/or uses make a userpage "useful to the Project" and, conversely, what failures make it "detrimental to the Project"?
##At what point does a useless draft become a violation of [[WP:CSD#U5|CSD U5]] and [[WP:NOTWEBHOST]]? For the purposes of CSD U5, what is a "plausible draft"?
##Can a stale userpage (one that has not been edited in more than a year) of an inactive user (someone who has not edited in more than a year) be considered "useful to the Project"?
##Does a userpage's uselessness alone warrant deletion at MfD or any other venue, or must it also pose some detriment to the Project, such as by qualifying for speedy deletion?
##If the answer to the above question is "depends", what other criteria should be considered in deciding about deletion?
#What distinguishes a sandbox from other userpages, and in what ways, if any, should policy treat them differently?
#Do drafts that serve no use to the Project and have no potential to be improved to the point of usefulness warrant deletion?
##Should the answer to the above question vary depending on whether said draft is in the userspace of the draftspace?
##What things give a draft potential for improvement or, conversely, deprive it of said potential? Is notability one of these things and, if so, how should we reconcile that with [[WP:NMFD]]?
#For the purposes of policy, what is the difference between blanking and soft deletion, and which is preferable in what situations? When are they preferable to normal deletion?
#Is it appropriate to move a stale userspace draft to draftspace if you have no intent of working on it?
#When, if ever, is it appropriate to ask an active editor to do something with a stale draft?

Discussion is not limited to these questions, and should include any and all pertinent topics. These are merely the questions that have been bouncing around in my head these past several days and as I was drafting this RfC.

I propose that it's useful for an infobox to be included on this article.

The previous RfC wasn't done in accordance with [[WP:RFC]] or [[WP:THIRDOPINION]] as four editors were [[WP:CANVASS|WP:CANVASSED]] into commenting of which invalid arguments were made that because Numerounovedant has done most of the work on this particular article the editors sided with his preference for the article to use the image rather than the infobox. This is also contrary to [[WP:OWN]] and a discussion isn't a [[WP:VOTE]].

The argument that "In fact, every detail is practically mentioned in the first couple of sentences and therefore it is just redundant information" no longer applies as the subject now has a child which would be included if the article had an infobox as well as his alma mater. [[WP:LOCALCONSENSUS]] can't override a general editing guideline. [[User:Tanbircdq|Tanbircdq]] ([[User talk:Tanbircdq|talk]]) 20:40, 1 May 2018 (UTC)}}

Should the map currently in the infobox be changed? Anatolia and its provinces have had many boundaries throughout a long history. The map currently in the lede one is non-specific as to the historical period it is referring to, with a very poorly worded caption. 

Based on the 1911 Britannica map below, it also seems the hand drawn boundary line of the current infobox map was not drawn accurately. I've checked the given citations and they fail verification. It is a bit hard to see, but Britannica has numbered the regions — the result is similar to the high-quality 2nd century AD map below.

I would like to replace this with a map that is attractive, accurate, with clear readable labels and a defined time period. I'm not set on any particular date or period.

{{rfcquote|text=
I started a discussion already in the section immediately above, but starting a separate RFC section here in order to bring in more participation from a broader cross-section of Wikipedia community.

In brief, my proposal here has two components which, as noted above, would bring this article into line with the conventions already well established at other Syria-related articles, such as the main [[Syria]] article:

1. The Syrian government should be referred to as the "Syrian government" (or "government of Syria," or similar), not as the "Assad government," the "Assad regime," or anything along those lines.  Again, this is not only NPOV, but also would bring it in line with conventions elsewhere on Wikipedia.

2. The lede section should focus exclusively on the current primary flag of the government of Syria - i.e. the one with horizontal red, white, and black stripes and two green stars.

Naturally, historic flags of Syria should also be mentioned in the article, and the flags used by any group occupying parts of Syrian territory, whether a rebel group like the FSA, ISIS, or al-Nusra, or a foreign power like Israel or Turkey, could also be mentioned.  But the article should not suggest that any of these groups or their flags are somehow on equal footing with the actual government of Syria and its current flag.

As noted in the section above, the current status-quo for this article apparently emerged a number of years ago, towards the beginning of the war, when various rebel groups were rapidly advancing, and it looked like the government of Syria might fall at anytime and be replaced.  But this is no longer the case at all today. -[[Special:Contributions/2003:CA:83C1:3500:DD19:E151:C1C3:7FC5|2003:CA:83C1:3500:DD19:E151:C1C3:7FC5]] ([[User talk:2003:CA:83C1:3500:DD19:E151:C1C3:7FC5|talk]]) 19:16, 6 May 2018 (UTC)}}

In the current article which treats on the modern names for biblical sites, there is an entry for the "Country Name." As is known, many of these biblical sites are in Israel, also known as Palestine, being the same geographical country. However, there has been an attempt to politicize the "Country Name," by writing either "Palestinian territories" or "Israel," as if it were two separate countries. It is my view that we ought to be apolitical about the "Country Name," and that wherever these two designations apply in this particular article, we should write both "Palestine/Israel." In this way we keep this issue neutral, in accordance with Wikipedia's policy in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Palestine-Israel_articles Palestine-Israel articles]. Any other views on how we should proceed here? Please add your comment.[[User:Davidbena|Davidbena]] ([[User talk:Davidbena|talk]]) 23:08, 6 May 2018 (UTC)}}

I'm seeking further comment to see if it is possible to make the rules clearer for how hospital reputation, rankings, ratings, and awards are handled on Wikipedia. What should the established standard be for how ratings and rankings are included on hospital Wikipedia articles?

A bit more background, in case it's helpful: As I have proposed updates to [[Cleveland Clinic]]'s existing ''Reputation'' section, a common response from volunteer editors is that other hospital articles should not be used for guidance. I looked at the Wikipedia articles for the nine hospitals in ''U.S. News & World Report''{{'}}s Top 10. Of those, six of the articles either listed the hospitals' specialty rankings or contained a table: [[Mayo Clinic]], [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], [[UCSF Medical Center]], [[Michigan Medicine]], [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital]], and [[Stanford Health Care]]. Three did not: [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]], and [[Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania]]. There are other differences in how this info is handled: While the Cleveland Clinic article has a ''Reputation'' section, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Michigan Medicine have ''Rankings'', New York-Presbyterian Hospital has ''Awards and recognition'', UCSF Medical Center and Stanford Health Care have rankings listed in the introduction.

I hope this conversation leads to more discussion on ways to create a set of standards for streamlined further development of all hospital articles on Wikipedia. Thanks, [[User:ClevelandClinicES|ClevelandClinicES]] ([[User talk:ClevelandClinicES|talk]]) 15:06, 7 May 2018 (UTC)}}

'''Request for comment: Should [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bust_of_Cristiano_Ronaldo&oldid=840385297 this version of the "Bust of Cristiano Ronaldo"] exist in the main space?'''

Back in April 2017, the [[Bust of Cristiano Ronaldo]] article was redirected to the [[Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport]] article, per [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bust of Cristiano Ronaldo|this AfD discussion]]. In March 2018, I revisited [[Draft:Bust of Cristiano Ronaldo]] (now merged as the result of [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Public_Art/Archive_2#Bust_of_Cristiano_Ronaldo_2|this discussion]] and [[User_talk:KJP1#Bust|this discussion]]), after a ''second'' bust depicting Ronaldo was created by the same artist. Again, the project received significant secondary coverage in reliable sources.

I started [[Talk:Cristiano_Ronaldo_International_Airport#Bust_of_Cristiano_Ronaldo,_part_2|this discussion on the airport article's talk page]], and invited editors who participated in previous discussions to weigh in, including editors who commented in the AfD discussion. I made the mistake of also discussing the same topic in other locations, including [[Talk:Bust_of_Cristiano_Ronaldo#Merge]] and [[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2018 May 9]], and at several WikiProjects in an attempt to get more editors to weigh on in the discussion. I take responsibility for starting discussions in too many spaces, but I was just trying to get wider community input.

My attempt to ask for help [[User_talk:Number_57#Bust_of_Cristiano_Ronaldo|here]] was not particularly helpful, and when I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bust_of_Cristiano_Ronaldo&type=revision&diff=840386438&oldid=840385297 tried to make updates to the redirected article] (with "under construction" template displayed), {{u|Number 57}} reverted. I've since been [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bust_of_Cristiano_Ronaldo&diff=840396452&oldid=840396205 accused of trying to hide discussions] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bust_of_Cristiano_Ronaldo&diff=prev&oldid=840387166 threatened with WP:ANI]. I was just trying to make additional expansions and collapse/archive some of the side discussions and centralize comments [[Talk:Cristiano_Ronaldo_International_Airport#Bust_of_Cristiano_Ronaldo,_part_2|here]]. I'm not looking to ''hide'' dissenting opinions.

Now, I've noticed editors with an interest in sports seem not to like this article, while editors with an interest in public art/sculpture do. I know some editors will be upset that I've opened this request for comment, and I expect we will see similar voting based on ''sports vs. work of art''. This is why I feel a new discussion needs to be had by a wider net of Wikipedia editors, and on this article talk page, not the airport article's talk page. Many editors have contributed to this discussion, but few have commented on the ''most recent version of the article'', which has recently-merged content from the draft space, and can be seen '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bust_of_Cristiano_Ronaldo&oldid=840386438 here]'''.

I am looking for editors to '''re-assess the notability of this topic'''. The article now has information about ''two original works of art'', both of which have received significant press coverage. I've used the "Media, the arts, and architecture" and
"Society, sports, and culture" parameters for this RfC.

Right now the template guidance is that NLM/MathSciNet abbreviations should only be added when they differ from the ISO 4 abbreviation. This was added by {{user|Randykitty}}. If feel that in the old presentation, those abbreviations would have taken a look of spaces, and that the advice made sense then. However, with re-organization/improved presentation, I feel that advice is no longer productive. We ''should'' add those abbreviations when we have them. If there's redundancy, that's not a big deal.

According to user [[User:MaxBrowne2|MaxBrowne2]], "clear consensus" has been reached about the inclusion of the non-sequitur Eugenie Scott quote in Dr. Sarfati's bio. However, as best I can tell, it is a consensus of 3 or 4 people against one (myself), which is hardly a strong consensus. More importantly, though, no one has been able to give any reasonable defense as to why that quote actually belongs in Dr. Sarfati's bio! We need more than consensus here. We need a reasoned defense of including what appears completely out of place and unnecessarily disparaging towards Dr. Sarfati. This bio page is not a forum for debating creationism. Until such a time as a reasonable explanation can be given as to why that should be there, I believe it is appropriate to tag this article for POV.--[[User:Kanbei85|Kanbei85]] ([[User talk:Kanbei85|talk]]) 21:06, 7 June 2018 (UTC)}}

The deletion of drafts via MfD was previously discussed over two years ago in  [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability/Archive_58#RfC:_Does_WP:N_apply_to_drafts_in_userspace_or_draftspace.3F|this RfC]] that concluded that drafts should not be subject to the notability criteria, but that there may be other valid reasons for the deletions of drafts. Reading the comments of the RfC and the close, there also seemed to be agreement that drafts should be works in progress, eventually expected to meet mainspace standards. Currently, it is possible to continually resubmit a declined draft to AfC with no changes while not meeting any of the CSD criteria or failing [[WP:NOTWEBHOST]] and effectively stay in draft space forever. This has caused some back and forth at MfD as what to do with these articles. To help provide clarity for this situation, I am proposing [[WP:NMFD]] be modified to read the following (updated text in red):
{{talkquote|Drafts are not subject to [[WP:ACSD|article deletion]] criteria like "no context" or no indication of notability so creators may have time to establish notability. Drafts may be nominated for deletion at [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion]], but not {{red|solely based upon a}} concern about notability. {{red|A draft that has been repeatedly resubmitted and declined at AfC without any substantial improvement may be deleted at [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion]] if consensus determines that it is unlikely to ever meet the requirements for mainspace and it otherwise meets one of the [[Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Reasons_for_deletion|reasons for deletion]] outlined in [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy]].}}}}

A [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/Archive_145#Disable_messages_left_by_InternetArchiveBot|previous RfC]] halted new talk page posts by InternetArchiveBot. 

This RfC is to see if there is consensus to delete the posts. It affects about 1 million talk pages. An [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Namibian_Port_Authority&oldid=825153665 example post] that would be deleted.

There are two options for deletion:
:'''#1''' - a bot edits the 1 million pages deleting posts. Archived talk pages will be left alone. Bot operator [[User:GreenC]] has volunteered.
:'''#2''' - the wording of the post is modified to give users permission to delete posts if they want to. Since talk page posts normally can't be deleted by other users, it would remove that restriction. The wording can easily be changed via the {{tlx|sourcecheck}} template, '''it would not require every page be edited'''.

Please !vote '''support''' or '''oppose'''. Clarify choice of method #1 and/or #2 in order of preference.

{{u|Rolf H Nelson}} suggests above that we add more information about the Wayback Machine's response into the "Controversial Blogposts" subsection. I disagree, because that section is already longer than the entire rest of the Career section (363 words vs 362 words.)

I am going to request outside comment on the question of relative length here. I thought we had consensus on a neutral account of the events (which are now completely out of the news, by the way) but every edit since then has been someone adding more (negative) material to the section. 

I believe this controversy, already fading from news articles, is already treated at [[WP:UNDUE]] length. My question is, Can others give some guidance?

I have unfortunately been engaged in edit wars on the Infoboxes of various Vietnam War battle pages with a User who is adding "US claims" or "US reports" or the wikilink to [[Body count#Vietnam War]] before the figures for North Vietnamese/Vietcong casualties. I am fine with any one of US report/claim/source/body count being added, showing that this is the US account of North Vietnamese/Vietcong casualties and I believe that this is in line with other battle pages, particularly those where casualties are contested. However this User has in various case inserted the formulation "US Claims: X killed ([[Body count#Vietnam war|body count]])" or even "US Source: X killed ([[Body count#Vietnam war|body count]] claim)" which to me is like saying "US claim claim claim" and I believe that is POV designed to (further) undermine the credibility of US claims of North Vietnamese/Vietcong losses which are already discussed in detail at [[Body count]]. Can you please advise below if you support or oppose the use of only one of report, claim, source or [[Body count#Vietnam war|body count]] on all Vietnam War battle pages. regards [[User:Mztourist|Mztourist]] ([[User talk:Mztourist|talk]]) 10:42, 7 June 2018 (UTC)}}

Above on the article's talk page, there is a dispute with regard to critical reception material in the article (the [[Rey (Star Wars)#Parentage|Parentage section]]). One argument is that [[Kylo Ren]] didn't state the actual words "they are nobodies" to [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] about her parents. Therefore, we shouldn't state that Kylo Ren said this. In contrast to this view, reliable sources (seen below in the Discussion section) state that Kylo Ren told or led Rey to believe that her parents are nobodies, despite not using the actual word "nobodies." Therefore, the other argument is that we should be able to report that Kylo Ren did this. So can/should we? 

I'll alert [[WP:Film]] to this RfC. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 08:53, 2 June 2018 (UTC)}}

Dr. Gregory B. Sadler is a notable Hegel popularizer (undoubtedly a unique demographic!).

I've placed this under geography, although it could go under biology as well. There appears to be a long-waged edit war on this page with regards to the coordinates for Hyperion. I've located a past discussion regarding the need to cite coordinates, as anybody can verify them by going to the location. IMO, this is equivalent to a photograph claiming to be of a certain location.

Other arguments raised in this particular topic are that the park services or discoverer don't want want the location made publicly available due to fears of vandalism (which is not backed by a source).

Should coordinates be included? Do they, and by extension all of the million or so coordinates on en.wiki, require citation? Do the opinions of the park services hold any weight?

I am the creator of this article, and the neutrality of the article was immediately questioned upon the article's creation. At the time of the article's creation, almost all mentions of the site in [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] were negative, and nothing has changed since then. The site's articles have been attack by both [http://www.politifact.com/personalities/bipartisan-report/ Politifact] and [https://www.snopes.com/tag/bipartisan-report/ Snopes], which is worth mentioning in the article since both are reliable sources. However, there have been repeated attempts by IP addresses belonging to travel-related networks ([[Gogo Inflight Internet]], a hotel, etc) trying to whitewash the article of any mentions of criticism (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/12.130.117.181 this], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/12.130.117.152 this], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/49.231.236.17 this], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bipartisan_Report&diff=next&oldid=824965845 this]). Most recently, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kk01011991 a relatively new user removed all references to criticism of the website]. I suspect someone who does a lot of traveling is responsible for all of these edits, either deliberately using IPs around the world for the purposes of [[WP:Sockpuppetry|deception]] or just out of convenience. 

I propose that the analysis of Bipartisan Report's claims by [[Snopes]] and [[Politifact]] be readded to the article, with as neutral tone as possible.

CAA brought a highly unusual private prosecution against Alison Chabloz. Ms Chabloz disputes the inclusion and characterisation of this content, specifically: she disputes that she is accused of antisemitic acts but instead the charges relate to "grossly offensive" words, stating that "{{tq|Wikipedia is supposedly independent of mainstream media. What's the point of an independent outlet that simply parrots mainstream soundbites?
}}" and denigrating the coverage as {{tq|moronic mainstream media articles}}; she asserts that she should be described as a musician not a blogger, and that the term blogger is a deliberate insult; she insists that she should be called a "holocaust revisionist" not a "holocaust denier". The following questions appear to be germane:
# Should the private prosecution be included?

# Should the target of the prosecution be characterised as antisemitic, per [http://courtnewsuk.co.uk/judge-considering-verdict-on-antisemitic-songwriter/ Court News] and the other RS listed above?

Disagreement over how to define trans man. One side states that any person who is born male is a man (male human) and the other side states that any person who identifies as a man is a man (masculine identity). Both sides argue that their position is supported by alternate interpretations of the same sources.

Too often, "songs by artist" categories associate an artist's entire repertoire with one or more genres, even when song articles include no mention of those genres.

For example: [[:Category:Lady Gaga songs]] is a subcategory of "American synthpop songs", "Dance-pop songs", and "Electropop songs", yet entries include "[[Cheek to Cheek]]" and "[[Nature Boy]]", which are ''definitely'' none of the aforementioned genres.

Should we stop classifying "songs by artist" categories by genre?

We already do in this article, because I changed it some time ago, but should we not use this, if not universally, at least in all articles that are actually ''about Alaska''? Because as of right now there are over a hundred articles using the highly inaccurate map and only 5 using the more accurate one.

Many shows, such as talk shows and game shows, have voiceover talent that is more commonly referred to as an "announcer" than a narrator. For instance, [[Jim Thornton]]'s article refers to him as the "announcer" of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', and the text of that article refers to all of its voiceover talent as "announcers". Is there a way that the "narrator" field can be modified to use "announcer" instead in instances where that is the more common term? <span style="color:green">'''Ten Pound Hammer'''</span> • <sup>([[User talk:TenPoundHammer|What did I screw up now?]])</sup> 01:23, 24 May 2018 (UTC)}}

It seems that, although the title "Supreme Leader" is widely used to refer to the Leader of Iran, it doesn't exist in the Iranian Constitution [[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/ir/ir001en.pdf]], nor is it used by the Encyclopedia Britannica [[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ali-Khamenei]], both of which use the term Leader.

As per the discussions above there was no consensus to use the term left-wing to far-left in the infobox. I along with other editors above advocate keeping the political position section of the infobox blank for the reasons given above. In regards to authoritarian socialism there was discussion as to whether it could be regarded as a term. This has no bearing on whether or not it should be in the political positions section of the infobox, which it shouldn't. If this fits anywhere its in the ideology section. Authoritarian socialism does not fit on the political spectrum, that's a fact, so it has no reason to be in that section of the infobox. Also none of the sources used to support the claim of the party being authoritarian socialist actually directly stated the party is authoritarian socialist, therefore breaking [[WP:SYNTHESIS]], and as such should not be included.

{{quote|In 2013, the [[Croatian Wikipedia#2013 controversy about right-wing bias|Croatian-language version of Wikipedia]] gained media attention after the daily newspaper ''[[Jutarnji list]]'' reported on critic's concerns that administrators and editors on the website were projecting a [[Far-right politics in Croatia|right-wing]] bias into topics such as the [[Ustashe]] regime, [[anti-fascism]], [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]], the [[LGBT]] community, and [[gay marriage]]. Many of the critics were former editors of the website who said they had been exiled for expressing concern. The small size of the Croatian Wikipedia — as of September 2013, it had 466 active editors of which 27 were administrators — was cited as a major factor.

I edited this page (as I did in 2016, when I was [[User:FiscalSpace|FiscalSpace]]: took a long wikibreak and couldn't remember my password when I rejoined, so took on a similar name, which seemed the right thing to do). I then recently returned to this page and noted the allegations of sockpuppetry and carried out a revision that took it back to the pre-sockpuppet version. I don't think anything I did was vandalism in any way. However, now a user ([[User:Mcmanusbr|McManusbr]]) has reverted my edits and (a) accuses me of "vandal like edits" and (b) says I have a "longstanding grudge" against the doctor. 

Two things: first, I don't think any of my edits were vandalism, but I would welcome the views of more experienced editors; second, how could the user know - or suspect - that I have a 'personal grudge' against Dr Treacy without being either Dr Treacy or someone very close to him - in which case the page is being edited by the subject of the page or someone close to him, which gives rise to a  conflict of interest and is also entirely consistent with the history of previous Dr Treacy pages -see below? I don't, by the way, have a grudge against him, just against the advertising that this page seems to indulge in.

I know that previous checkuser has exposed sockpuppets continually editing this page (which is why I reverted back to a reasonably pre-sockpuppet version): I wonder about [[User:Mcmanusbr|McManusbr]], too.

In any event, I think that someone more experienced that I should make a call on this page. I'm not going to get into a fight with a user who throws around accusations of vandalism, but the history of this particular page and the previous history of other pages set out below, should give pause for thought before calling my edits vandalism and favouring the most recent version. Particular problems with this page are (a) that almost every fact recorded on it is traceable back only to the subject of the article himself and claims he has made (something  which my edits looked to reflect) and (b) that this page seems to have been edited only by sock-puppets and people close to the subject. 

Having said all that though, insofar as certain awards are now referenced in the most recent version, that seems to be an improvement.

Looking back at my 2016 comments I noted that someone called [[User:Peege1969|Peege1969]] (more or less the same twitter handle as subject) added the photo. Since then the same user reverted a previous edit that someone with an interest in the subject of the article might have wanted to see reverted. Anyway, it's all - as Douglas Adams said - an SEP.

*Shall the article '''[[Living dinosaur]]''' be changed from a standard format article, to a disambiguation list-format article?

'''Note''' - The article has existed since 2006, starting out as more of a list-type page, but evolving into an article with prose by 2010. There were [[Talk:Living_dinosaur#Cryptozoology_section|recent discussions]] about expansion by adding sentences on the [[Tuatara]] and [[Enigma moth]], creatures actually called ''living dinosaurs'' in sources. Other article contents have also been [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Partridge Creek monster (Cryptid)|discussed about merging]] into the ''Living dinosaur'' article. However, a couple editors have expressed a desire to change ''Living dinosaur'' into a [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Disambiguation pages|non-article formal disambiguation list-form page]] with little to no prose, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Living_dinosaur&oldid=843369017 such as with this example].

I thought it best that more editors should have eyes and comments on what final form a 12 year-old article should take to best serve our readers. Major editors of this article and the proper WikiProjects should be informed. I felt a 12 year-old article warranted more discussion than just three or four editors when such a huge change could be taking place. Thanks.

Should any editor who changes "far-right" to "far-left" in describing Nazism, Fascism, neo-Nazism, and other close-related ideologies be subject to immediate blocking as a disruptive editor, tantamount to a vandal?

'''Survey (no threaded discussion, please)'''

*'''Yes''' -  This is a constant problem in protecting articles on these subjects from damage, and a tool is needed to nip the damage these editors do in the bud.{{parabr}}In the real world of academics, historians and other experts, there is absolutely no doubt that Nazism, Fascism, neo-Nazism and other closely-related ideologies exist on the far-right of the right/left political spectrum, despite the fact that some instantiations of these ideologies espouse or put into effect some views which are usually associated with socialism, a leftist ideology.  Given that the placement of the political systems described is firmly fixed by expert consensus as being on the far-right, and that this is unlikely to change any time in the near future, any editor who makes changes of "far-right" to "far-left" is clearly someone editing in accord with their [[WP:FRINGE]] personal point of view, and are therefore violating [[WP:NPOV]], as well as engaging in [[WP:OR|original research]].  Since no reputable expert agrees with their edits, they are also making edits which are unverifiable on their face, violating [[WP:V]]. The majority of editors who engage in this activity do so without providing any sources, and those that do are violating [[WP:RS]].{{parabr}}Such editors should be considered as being [[WP:Disruptive editing|disruptive]], and as ''de facto'' vandals, and when their edits are presented to an administrator, the editor in question should be immediately blocked unless there is overwhelming credible evidence to provide a basis on which the admin can invoke administrative discretion and not make the block.  The '''''presumption''''', however, should be that editors making such changes are to be blocked, and an admin who does not do so should be prepared to explain their decision to the community on demand, per [[WP:ADMINACCT]]. <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Beyond My Ken|Beyond My Ken]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beyond My Ken|contribs]]) 06:11, 29 June 2018 (UTC)}}

Should the article mention Melania Trump's "I don't really care" jacket?

Something like:

{{tq2|In June 2018, following immense public opposition to the [[Trump administration family separation policy]] , Melania Trump traveled to visit a children's shelter in Texas. At the outset of the trip, she appeared wearing a $39 [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]] military-style jacket emblazoned with the phrase "I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?". The controversial jacket drew worldwide reactions, some describing the fashion choice as "Insensitive", "heartless" and "unthinking".

{{rfcquote|text=
I am asking about the most neutral way to present the figures of "Communist death toll" presented by Courtois in the introduction to [[the Black Book of Communism]] (aka BB).

*In the introduction to the Black Book of Communism, the editor of this volume, Coirtois, provides the figures of communist death toll. These figures, as well as the very idea to combine loosely connected events under a single category, has been severely criticized. The examples of criticism are provided [[talk:Mass killings under Communist regimes#BB reviews|here]], and many critics blame Courtois in manipulation with figures and their deliberate inflation. In addition, the idea to connect the deaths with some "generic Communism" concept (defined down to the common denominator of party movements founded by intellectuals) has been criticised by other authors,<ref>Michael David-Fox, On the Primacy of Ideology: Soviet Revisionists and Holocaust Deniers (In Response to Martin Malia). ''Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History'', Volume 5, Number 1, Winter 2004 (New Series), pp. 81-105 (Article) DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1353/kri.2004.0007]</ref> who argues that a connection between, e.g., events in Pol Pot's Cambodia and Stalin's USSR is far from evident, and Pol Pot’s study of Marxism in Paris is insufficient for connecting radical Soviet industrialism and the Khmer Rouge’s murderous anti-urbanism under the same category. Furthermore, the figures produced by Courtois are always presented to advocate the idea that Communism was greater evil than Nazism. This idea has been criticized by many authors<ref>Jens Mecklenburg and Wolfgang Wippermann, eds, ‘Roter Holocaust’? Kritik des Schwarzbuchs des Kommunismus [A ‘Red Holocaust’? A Critique of the Black Book of Communism], Hamburg, Konkret Verlag Literatur, 1998; ISBN 3–89458–169–7</ref>

Many critics also note that the Courtois's introduction to the BB is the most problematic part of this collective volume, and most criticism is focused on it. Even some contributors to the BB publicly disassociated themselves from the conclusions presented in the introduction (see the link to the talk page), and from the figures in particular.
In connection to that, my concrete questions are:

# Should we always discriminate between the ''introduction to the BB'' and the BB proper every time the introduction is cited?
# Should we always explain that the introduction is "controversial" when the BB introduction is used as a source?
# Should we always describe the controversy around the figures presented in the introduction when the introduction is being used as the source for these figures?
# Should we explain the objections to the "generic Communism" concept every time the combined "Communist death toll" calculated in the BB introduction is being discussed in an article?
These questions are independent, and the answers can be, for example, "Yes - No - No - Yes".

The current topic  "''Mass killing under Communist regimes''" has several possible interpretations. 
Would ''"Non-combatant deaths attributed to communist regimes"''  reasonably reduce the number of interpretations? This would eliminate arguments as to causality, and intent, being critical to the general topic, as well as arguments as to the definition of "Communist" as a proper adjective. 00:21, 31 May 2018 (UTC)}}

Does this belong? If something should be trimmed, what precisely should be trimmed? Note that the content is extremely well-sourced, covers a number of notable events (student protests, senior staff resigning, speakers being disinvited) and covers events that are of obvious importance to a university that plays a prominent role in Republican politics. Consider for example if LU was "fractured" in the early 2000s over the university's relationship to George W. Bush (or Ronald Reagan in the 80s) during his presidency with prominent student protests, students returning diplomas, senior staff resigning and alumni speakers being disinvited, and that all of this was reported by 9 reliable sources. Would anyone seriously argue that such content would not have encyclopedic value (an interesting notable episode in the history of this university) and easily fulfill Wiki policy requirements?

This is not usually an area I would stand my ground over but I feel I really can't edit this article without being in a revert cycle. This is part of a wider issue on this article with behaviour verging on ownership and minor attacks in edit summaries towards multiple users- labelling them and their edits 'vandalism', 'Bias or personal opinions', 'biased and not educated' and the best one 'Wikipedia should not suffer for your trash.' (see the recent [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_London&action=history history]). 

All the conflicting edits appear to involve IPs addresses in a similar locality. Previously conflicts (over different content) involved a failure to engage the editor in the talk discussion (see [[#Popular culture]], hence I turn to an Rfc this time.

The content under debate is the lead sentence, should it read:
*{{tq|The '''University of London''' (informally '''London University''' and commonly abbreviated as '''Lond. or, more rarely, Londin''')}} or
*{{tq|The '''University of London''' (abbreviated as '''Lond.''' or more rarely '''Londin''' in [[Post-nominal letters|post-nominals]]) }}
I believe the second option is more appropriate, firstly, I see no sources showing it is referred to as '''London University'''. Even so, its unnecessary to tell people that the order of the name can be rearranged and guess what - same place. Second, its name is not ''commonly'' abbreviated as these abbreviations. To say so is misleading, it is only abbreviated like this for [[Post-nominal letters]]. This is why I also favour simply keeping to the sentence that is already at the end of the lead (in my first edit that as reverted). 

Thanks for reading this far, hopefully some extra input can help we can avoid these endless contact disputes

The RfC above is poorly framed and is asking for permission to use any source on the subject even when those sources do not mention e-cigarette marketing, promotion, or advertising. If the RfC was framed differently would editors give a different response? Can we use a source to address the marketing claims when that source does not specifically state it was in relation to the marketing claims? For example, can we use a source about the safety of e-cigarettes when the source did not indicate the safety information about e-cigarettes being discussed is in relation to the marketing of e-cigarettes? Using a source to address the marketing claims is done on a case-by-case basis.

As per the discussions above there was no consensus to use the term left-wing to far-left in the infobox. I along with other editors above advocate keeping the political position section of the infobox blank for the reasons given above. In regards to authoritarian socialism there was discussion as to whether it could be regarded as a term. This has no bearing on whether or not it should be in the political positions section of the infobox, which it shouldn't. If this fits anywhere its in the ideology section. Authoritarian socialism does not fit on the political spectrum, that's a fact, so it has no reason to be in that section of the infobox. Also none of the sources used to support the claim of the party being authoritarian socialist actually directly stated the party is authoritarian socialist, therefore breaking [[WP:SYNTHESIS]], and as such should not be included.

It's useful for an infobox to be included on this article.

The utility of including infoboxes are standard in BLPs and there's clearly enough information here for a well formatted infobox. There doesn't appear to be any compelling reason not to include one as the information provided is helpful for casual readers at a glance (especially for parameters such as date of birth which would include the subject's age which isn't currently included anywhere in the article). Also, most people probably get their answers from the infobox or the filmography rather than visiting the article to read a whole biography.

A proposed infobox (most of this information isn't included in the lead) would include name, image, date of birth, place of birth, age, residence, nationality, alma mater, occupation, years active, filmography, home town, parent and awards.

Formal editing restrictions, voluntarily accepted by an editor, have been logged on [[WP:Editing restrictions]] under the heading of ''Voluntary''. The three extant restrictions are:
# A voluntary [[WP:IBAN|interaction ban]] between two editors which is logged as "Indefinite". [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Editing_restrictions/Voluntary&oldid=799233002]
# A [[WP:TBAN|topic ban]] with a specific expiration date. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Editing_restrictions/Voluntary&diff=831905073&oldid=831904994]
# A [[WP:TBAN|topic ban]] which is noted as both being enforceable by blocks and saying appeals are to be heard at [[WP:AN]]. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Editing_restrictions/Voluntary&diff=840698946&oldid=838282691&diffmode=visual][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Editing_restrictions/Voluntary&diff=841564168&oldid=840698946&diffmode=visual]

Debate has arisen over whether voluntary restrictions such as these are enforceable in the same way a [[WP:CBAN|community based ban]] can be. The question of this RfC is:

<blockquote> ''Are editing restrictions which are accepted voluntarily and logged at [[WP:Editing restrictions]] to be treated in the same way as  the [[WP:CBAN|community placed restrictions]] logged on the same page? This question deals with §4.3 [[WP:Editing restrictions#Voluntary]] and not §5 [[WP:Editing restrictions#Final warnings / Unblock conditions]]. </blockquote> [[User:Jbhunley|<span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:135%;color:#886600">Jbh</span>]][[User_talk:Jbhunley|<span style="color: #00888F"><sup> Talk</sup></span>]] 06:23, 7 June 2018 (UTC)}}

I would like to draw attention to the depiction in this article of a controversy concerning an episode of this series and the response of the producers of the show. The dispute lies between two different versions of this article's description of the controversy:

# [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantico_(season_3)&diff=prev&oldid=845128122 This one], written predominantly by tendentious [[WP:SPA|single-purpose editor]] [[User:Krish!|Krish!]] (see combative edit summaries in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Krish! contribs]), which I believe violate [[WP:NPOV|Neutrality]] (value laden language like 'hateful tweets'), [[Poisoning the well]] fallacy ('criticized by Indians'), wilful disregard for content that provides valuable context (blanking of "This was dismissed as "ridiculous" and unrealistic, given .."), and numerous other unencyclopedic edits.

Clearly, this is a content dispute that's heating up rapidly, and so I have elected to take a step back and invite commentary from uninvolved objective editors so that further edits can proceed by consensus.

Should we restore the Arab/Arabic-related advice deemed correct but too narrow for the main MoS page, to this MoS subpage where it's on-topic?

Material recently reverted with "more support required", despite previous discussion of the idea meeting no opposition, on this very page:

{{block indent|1=
{{fake heading|level=3|Easily confusable terms}} 
{{shortcut|MOS:CONFUSE|MOS:ARAB}}
Do not use similar or related words in an incorrect, distorting, or meaning-blurring way.  For example, the adjective ''Arab'' refers to people and things of ethnic Arab origin. The term ''Arabic'' refers to the Arabic language or writing system, and related concepts. ''Arabian'' relates to the Arabian peninsula or historical Arabia. (These terms are all [[Proper noun|capitalized]], e.g. {{xt|Arabic coffee}} and {{xt|Arabian stallion}}, aside from a few conventionalized exceptions that have lost their cultural connection, such as {{xt|gum arabic}}.)  Do not substitute these terms for ''Islamic'', ''Moslem'', ''Islamist'', ''Middle-eastern'', etc.; a Moslem Arab is someone who is in both categories. Similar concerns pertain to many cultural, scientific, and other topics and the terminology used about them.  When in doubt about terminology, consult major modern dictionaries.

The 12th PM's govt was dissolved and later reinstated so the number for both terms before dissolution and after restoration should be 12. Now the 11th PM was Benazir Bhutto and she was re-elected in new elections and new voting after 12th PM resigned so she should be the 13th PM. She was not reinstated like 12th PM so the number should not be same for her 2nd term. Now after that 12th PM was re-elected in new elections but his number is still 12 like he's reinstated like before. Isn't this messed up? There's a difference between restoration and re-election. When a PM is restored he is restored to same old office but when he is re-elected it's new election, new voting, new oath and so new number as well. These numbers would probably be okay if these were consecutive terms like Obama was re-elected. There can’t be same number for non-consecutive terms. I've tried to change this but my edits are removed and asked to discuss about it. And another thing is we can't find any source which is focused on numbering. Some newspapers have used Wikipedia's numbering but it can't be used as source here as they are using Wikipedia as source. And this is a common sense thing so I think users should make a decision on this because there are many attempts to change it and many questions/discussion regarding the numbers on PM's talk pages. There’s no need to repeat numbers. If you see official government website for Prime Minsters of Pakistan you’ll see they don’t use same number they even changed number for reinstated term. So current numbering doesn’t make sense at all. It’s just confusing for everyone. Please end this dispute. There’s no reason for using current numbering.

{{ping|Jibran1998|Kashmiri|Vif12vf}} Shouldn't be changed?

No, Because number of Prime Minister is for the person. Express Tribune, Geo are reputable News Agencies you cant just ignore their News.

The health claim studies overviewed in the Health Claims section are 15+ years old. The below content is from a 2018 peer-reviewed journal and brings the reader up to date with the current status of kombucha health claim studies. Why would we not add something like the below paragraph to the "Health claims" section?

See "Content deleted" and "Sourced content deleted" talk sections for full details.

A 2018 review stated, several ''[[in vitro]]'' studies have been done for kombucha which were in 1998, 2000, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2017 as well as several researchers have done ''[[in vivo]]'' studies using rats from 2013 to 2015 for kombucha in the areas of diabetes, electromagnetic radiation, and liver and kidney toxicities due to diets high in cholesterol.<ref name=Villarreal-SotoBeaufort2018/> However, the results of biological activities have not been conﬁrmed for the purported health beneﬁts in humans.<ref name=Villarreal-SotoBeaufort2018>{{cite journal|last1=Villarreal-Soto|first1=Silvia Alejandra|last2=Beaufort|first2=Sandra|last3=Bouajila|first3=Jalloul|last4=Souchard|first4=Jean-Pierre|last5=Taillandier|first5=Patricia|title=Understanding Kombucha Tea Fermentation: A Review|journal=Journal of Food Science|volume=83|issue=3|year=2018|pages=580–588|issn=00221147|doi=10.1111/1750-3841.14068|pmid=29508944}}</ref>

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
In this article, a limited number (about half a dozen) of users are contributing recently, plus one who is only deleting.

The point of argument is the origin or national identity of Souliotes. Some users want to emphasize on sources which claim Albanian origin or identity (language etc), and others want to emphasize the local origin and Greek identity. 

The subject (Souliotes) has a peculiarity: Their traditional community and way of living disappeared around 1830's, and there are very few sources who had a real contact with them. The rest (especially sources of the 20th c.) are interpretations of the previous, and some are heavily biased by the late 20th c.  ethnic conflicts in the Balkans.

There is a section covering the 19th century sources in the article. Some (but not all) are already there, but there are more that qualify for this section. These old sources are just mentioned, with no comments. Two or three users are strongly opposing to a couple of these sources. Latest unwanted source, the Austrian Military Gazette of 1830. Another one is not even primary: William Leake [https://books.google.gr/books?id=9XUKAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=el&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=snippet&q=of%20Mount%20Pindus&f=false Leake W. "Travels in Northern Greece", London, 1835, vol. 1, p. 502]. The "problem" with those sources, as I understand it, is that they refer to Souliotes as Greeks and of local (rather than Albanian) origin. 

My argument is this: a) WP does not exclude the older sources from the articles, and gives certain guidelines on how to use them. b) There are already some early 19th century sources in the article. Therefore, if we are to exclude some, we must agree on the process of exclusion.

I would like to draw attention to the depiction in this article of a controversy concerning an episode of this series and the response of the producers of the show. The dispute lies between two different versions of this article's description of the controversy:
# [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantico_(season_3)&diff=845105676&oldid=845105518 This one], edited predominantly by myself, which I believe is neutral, concise, and adheres to wikipedia policies concerning [[WP:NPOV|Neutrality]],[[WP:N|Notability]],[[WP:RS|Reliability]] and [[WP:UNDUE|Due Weight]].
# [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantico_(season_3)&diff=prev&oldid=845128122 This one], written predominantly by tendentious [[WP:SPA|single-purpose editor]] [[User:Krish!|Krish!]] (see combative edit summaries in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Krish! contribs]), which I believe violate [[WP:NPOV|Neutrality]] (value laden language like 'hateful tweets'), [[Poisoning the well]] fallacy ('criticized by Indians'), wilful disregard for content that provides valuable context (blanking of "This was dismissed as "ridiculous" and unrealistic, given .."), and numerous other unencyclopedic edits.

Clearly, this is a content dispute that's heating up rapidly, and so I have elected to take a step back and invite commentary from uninvolved objective editors so that further edits can proceed by consensus.

Should this category be including individual people who are identified, by themselves or others, as "liberals"? The issue in this instance is that the selection of people so categorized here is incredibly random, partial and highly non-representative: the ''entirety'' of its selection of people consists of Barbara Boxer, Sheryl Crow, Whoopi Goldberg, Kamala Harris, Truc Ho, Hubert Humphrey, Cynthia Nixon, Walter Reuther, Susan Sarandon, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Barbara Streisand and Elizabeth Warren. Namely, four prominent politicians, a political activist, a writer, five people who are politically irrelevant entertainment industry figures, and one entertainment figure who is technically also a political candidate but is not notable for that per se, but ''not'' the hundreds or thousands of other notable people (Biden? Clooney? Gillibrand? Franken? Obama? The Clintons?) who would also belong here if people were fair game. I distinctly recall that there ''was'' a past consensus against categorizing non-political figures by ideology, and restricting categorization even of political figures to their ''political party'' rather than trying to assign them to liberalism or conservatism in general — but I don't know if that's since been deprecated, or if some editors have just been ignoring it and need a tap on the nose.

While fighting off mass waves of ip/new account vandalism on articles related to the world cup and the NBA drafts, I thought about how it would be easier if I could protect the pages instantly, instead of having to go to [[WP:RPP]], one of the most notoriously backlogged pages on the site. I believe that trusted users should be able to request a user right that would let them '''Semi-protect pages for a finite amount of time (a few months, 6 maybe, at most)'''. This right would have to be requested for and granted, and can be removed like any other right. Having this would massively benefit those more active in anti-vandalism work (like me), and would overall decrease the amount of vandalism/spam on the site by a large amount. I know the primary concern will be weather or not this right will be abused if edit wars happen with unregistered/new accounts, but the request process for the right should be able to filter out those who would abuse it in that way.[[User:Money emoji |<span style="text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml"><b style="color:#060">💵Money💵emoji💵</b></span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Money emoji|💸]]</sup> 17:09, 3 July 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Greetings, all. The article contains the historical context of the June 2018 referendum in Switzerland about "sovereign money," context found in the two sections titled "Background" and "Origin and proposal." There are objections to the material being in the article based on various arguments, such as that it relies too much or even entirely on primary sources, it's irrelevant, it gives undue weight to fringe viewpoints, and perhaps includes original research. There are also objections on the basis of the unreliability of the sources used. On the other hand, there are those who support the inclusion of historical context, and focus the argument on the legitimacy of the sources used. 

Let's begin the process with the section titled "[[Swiss_sovereign_money_referendum,_2018#Background|Background]]". Evidently, the referendum was not born suddenly and out of nowhere; the notions behind it (opposition to [[Fractional-reserve banking|fractional banking]], etc) have been around for a very long time. For instance, there exists information currently in that section about
::The [[Austrian economics|Austrians]]' objections to fractional banking
::The 1933 [[Chicago plan]] to do away with fractional banking criticism of fractional banking
::The introduction in the US Congress of a [[NEED Act|bill]] that included the same measures proposed in the referendum  
::The 2015 report by a gov't-appointed committee in [[Iceland]] that recommended measures similar to the referendum's
::And the basic notions behind the Swiss proposal as put forward by its initiators and ideologues, using sources and direct citations from their work.

::What is wikipedia current policy? power~enwiki? I am thinking of inclusiveness as one of them. Why shouldn't it be a current policy here? It is not consensus that should rule, that is too simplistic. Inclusiveness should also be considered for fuller coverage. It almost sounds like including third or independent parties as something that shouldn't happen? This, as an encyclopedia, should have all of the situation of the elections in Ohio. I have noticed some who have colluded to purposely deny ANY third party access on other Wiki pages. If you look you will find it. It is happening as we speak. To me it is deeply disturbing and should be to every wikipedian. bradv quoted me that wikipedia is not a democracy but I keep getting quoted info about polls as a basis for publishing. Democracy as in hearing people out is what's important. Publish the facts. So and so is running. Good! There are 5 candidates in Ohio. With only two pictures of them seems as though someone is playing favorites. Not a Democracy?, then no polls should be cited as an inclusive principle. Either way the poll argument is a fail, in that full information on THE candidates is not available. Dael4 (talk) 04:05, 28 July 2018 (UTC)}}

The issue of the use of [[chain (unit)|chains]] has again reared its head. It is now time to put this to bed by having a discussion and reaching consensus on the use of chains in railway articles.

;Articles likely affected:
Articles on railway stations and railway lines in the British Isles.

;Articles possibly affected
Artcles on railway stations and railway lines where the British had strong influence in their construction. Basically the British Empire and other areas, such as Argentina.

;The dispute
Some editors claim that the use of chains should be deprecated as they are a generally archaic measurement. Other editors claim that the use of chains is appropriate as long as external sources use chains, and that chains are a unit of measurement still used by the modern railway in the United Kingdom today.

;Previous discussions
*[[Talk:Darlington railway station#Distance from London]] (January 2018)

;Policies affecting this dispute
*[[WP:V]]

;Guidelines affecting this dispute
*[[WP:MOSUNIT]]

;Enforcement proceedures affecting this dispute

[Please excuse the length ... the topic is complicated] This post concerns the lede sentence:

"To demonstrate that you are not adding OR, you must be able to cite reliable, published sources that are directly related to the topic of the article, and directly support the material being presented."

It arose in Gaza beach explosion (2006) - Talk - section "3. Article Improvement Discussions", with discussions regarding the addressing of events in Gaza prior to beach explosions which all but wiped out an extended Palestinian family and sent shockwaves through the media. As with many of the Israel-Palestine conflicts (perhaps even 'all') the climax event, from which the name of the article is usually derived, hardly ever occurs randomly out of the blue with no prior build-up. Israel does not invade Gaza without militants from the Strip first having fired rockets at the southern Negev. Militants rarely do that out of pure spite, but because Israel has done something to prejudice their lives, like the assassination of a senior official, a crippling blockade, the killing of civilians near the border zone, etc. And those in turn have their antecedents also; the murder of teenagers, etc. This is not a new issue, and one related question goes - "How far back does one go? To the apple in the garden?" A few years ago KingsIndian (talk · contribs), fully aware of this issue, made what was accepted at the time as a very reasonable suggestion. Why not go back to a level playing field when all parties agreed to a cessation of hostilities, or to some informal but significant period of mutual calm - what I think he called a "blank slate". In that way we can avoid having an article "XXX event" and a separate article "Origin of the XXX Event" by including the prequel development of tensions between a cessation of hostilities (e.g. as a result of the ceasefire/truce) and the next bellicose flurry.

The above applies to less than epic "events". The prelude to the Six Day War for instance, would be as long as the rest of the article, which would be cumbersome. A brief flurry of a few days or even weeks might warrant having the prelude included in the main article. [I have no idea how one reasonably chooses how to make that split - a future topic]

So to get to the essence: Many events in the prelude of, say, the Gaza War (2008–09), have sources which never contemplated the future climactic war - Operation Cast Lead (OCL). The source on Arafat's death, that for the details of the understanding of the June 2008 ceasefire terms; the breaking of the ceasefire on 4 November 2008; the subsequent hail of rockets on Israel, many of the authors of the provided sources had no idea that OCL was soon to take place. To apply the WP:OR policy that sources must be directly related to the topic (the 2008/09 war - OCL) therefore usually requires some degree of subjective interpretation ... dangerous!! Yet a sequence of reliable sources may show that one individual event triggered the next. HOWEVER, there are VERY few quality sources that stitch all of these events together, and even more rarely, do so in Wiki-acceptable detail. Alternatively there are almost no sources that deny causal chains. Instead, one may appeal to "the sky is blue" principle that if A led to B, and B led to C, then A and C are part of the same sequence or chain. Sadly this process is usually interrupted by lengthy edit wars.

My proposal is that in the seemingly never-ending series of bellicose events, the preludes - the history of tension building - is encylopedically relevant to the climactic straw, and should be welcomed. But were sources to be disallowed that did not directly link the individual events in the chain to the breaking of the camel's back, (according to the Wiki condition quoted at the start), then this valuable chain of causative information would be excluded from Wiki. I am too much of a n000b to dredge Wiki protocol for a solution, so I look to more experienced peers. Maybe the solution is as simple as changing the article name from "Gaza beach explosion (2006)" to "Gaza beach explosion (2006) and its origin".

All, however, describe the actual situation of non-Jews in Israel, in law and in practice, in similar terms.

{{rfcquote|text=
The "In wrestling" section has been a standard part of professional wrestling biographies for over a decade. It covers mostly character information in a bulleted list format. On May 24, 2018, an editor raised an issue with the section's vague heading to [[WP:PW|WikiProject Professional wrestling]] (see [[WT:PW#In wrestling]]). The next day, renaming the heading to "Professional wrestling highlights" and adjusting "Championships and accomplishments" into a subsection beneath it was proposed. On June 3, it was considered to have reached consensus after the 5 participants agreed unanimously. In the weeks that followed, a few editors disapproved of the new heading, as well as "Championships and accomplishments" being turned into a subsection. On June 24, clarification of which heading to go forward with was requested, where an additional option to remove the section entirely was proposed. On June 28, the discussion was closed after 10 editors participated, with an "overwhelming consensus" to remove the section but rework any content deemed significant into prose, potentially into a "Professional wrestling persona" section (see [[WT:PW#Trying to gain clarity (closed)]]). The changes were immediately enacted into hundreds of articles, causing news of the changes to be spread onto online professional wrestling communities. Many new editors voiced frustration over the removal, with some reverting the changes.

Below is the style recommendations for this section, taken from WikiProject Professional wrestling [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Professional_wrestling/Style_guide&oldid=847654515 prior to its removal]:
{{Collapse top|"In wrestling" recommendations per WP:PW/SG}}
An overview of notable character information is compiled in a [[WP:BULLET|bulleted list format]]. This initial section should be limited to '''finishing moves''', '''signature moves''', '''managers''' (and/or '''wrestlers managed'''), '''nicknames''', '''entrance themes''', and '''wrestlers trained'''. Any taunts, gestures, or other descriptions are better suited for the article prose.

{{Collapse top|Example of highlights list}}

{{Collapse bottom}}

* All items should be sorted alphabetically. An exception is with entrance themes, which can be sorted chronologically if date ranges are sourced.
* For signature and finishing moves, there must be one reliable source explicitly mentioning that it is a signature move of the wrestler. One reliable source merely mentioning that the wrestler ''performed'' the move is not enough.
* A specially named move should be italicized, with the regular name following in parentheses and wiki-linked.
* {{tl|Cite episode}} should not be used for citing moves as commentators often call moves wrong or do not give full technical names, leading to speculation.
* Track names in entrance themes should not be wiki-linked to articles about the compilation albums on which they are sold, unless the article contains further information on the track itself (not just name, number, and wrestler who used it).
{{Collapse bottom}}

This proposal seeks to remove the "In wrestling" section, with the possibility of any of its content that is deemed significant to be contextualized in prose. Much of the information contained within this section would be lost. The content most likely to be reworked is certain Finishing moves, Nicknames and Wrestlers trained. As it stands, Managers are already expected to be covered in prose, primarily in the "Professional wrestling career" section. If necessary, reworked content can be placed within the existing "Professional wrestling persona" section (see [[WP:PW/SG#Professional wrestling persona]]).

Below are diffs from various articles, showing before the section's removal, after the removal, and some with content reworked to prose:

Should the section Immigration be removed from this BLP ?

The section was criticized as trivial in amount or portion of his positions, and just not biographically significant. 
It was a single line: Hannity opposed amnesty, then he favored a "path to citizenship" before he opposed that idea.[7] 

Since then the line has been been stated a bit more verbosely, and then another remark added: Hannity opposed amnesty, then he said in 2012 that he had evolved on the issue and favored a "pathway to citizenship".[118][7] Later, he opposed that idea.[7] By 2018, he was described as an "immigration hardliner".[119][120][121]

This is continuing discussions elsewhere, such as [[Wikipedia talk:Automated taxobox system#Reverting to 'manual' Taxoboxes]].  Sorry if I'm not posting this correctly, I just want to get this discussion started.

It seems there has not been a good clear discussion in the ToL and its related projects on the adoption of [[Wikipedia:Automated taxobox system]] over 'manual' taxoboxes like {{tl|taxobox}}.  Not all taxa can be converted to automatic (there isn't an automatic version of {{tl|Paraphyletic group}}, for example, and viruses need a new box too).  However, the overwhelming majority can use the automated taxobox system.

Should we officially adopt the automated taxobox system as the standard over the previous manual taxobox system? --[[User:NessieVL|Nessie]] ([[User talk:NessieVL|talk]]) 14:18, 11 July 2018 (UTC)}}

As {{ping|Peter coxhead}} noted [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Viruses#Automated taxobox system and viruses|above]], we need more voices here.  

Viruses are sadly not compatible with the automated taxobox system involving {{tl|Automatic taxobox}}, {{tl|Speciesbox}}, and so forth.  In addition, the old 'manual' system involves taxonomy predating the current [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICTV]] system, especially with regards to formatting (italics, etc.).  The taxonomy template hierarchy is compatible with viruses and other non-cellular life.  

# Should effort be made to create a virusbox template compatible with the automated taxobox system?
# What should the specifications of the new template be, if made?
# Should [[viroid]]s, [[prion]]s, [[Satellite (biology)|satellites]] and other virus-dependent nucleic acids be included in the same template, as they are [https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_9th_report/sub-viral-agents-2011/w/sub_viruses addressed by ICTV], even if [https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_9th_report/sub-viral-agents-2011/w/sub_viruses/165/1-fungal-prions the formal taxonomy of viruses does not extend to unconventional agents like prions and prion “species” are not included in the ICTV Master Species List]?

Shahanshah ({{literal translation|the king of kings}}) is a title that some [[List of monarchs of Persia|Shahs (kings) of Iran]] used and some did not.

The lead says, "Military occupation is distinguished from annexation by its intended temporary nature (i.e. no claim for permanent sovereignty), by its military nature, and by citizenship rights of the controlling power not being conferred upon the subjugated population." East Jerusalem was annexed by Israel. Available sources on the subject show that the majority of all international bodies and the majority of all international actors view this annexation as Illegal and further view that East Jerusalem is under Military occupation. For the sake of consistency with the Lead do we remove the listing for East Jerusalem?

Israel disengaged from the land of Gaza in 2005. Israel no long views Gaza being under Military occupation them. Their control of the borders, sea, and air of Gaza the sources show is the reason the international community views Gaza to still be under Military occupation.

Multiple editors have challenged this editor’s additions, two of whom (including myself) have explained why they disagree with them. “Chinese” is intended to be used to refer to persons who were born in mainland China and carry a Chinese passport (ex. [[Xi Jinping]]) as opposed to “Taiwanese” for persons born in the Republic of China ([[Tsai Ing-wen]]). In addition, “Taipei, Taiwan” is the most neutral and almost exclusively used term for Taipei; “Taipei, Taiwan, China”, I strongly feel ,goes against [[WP:POVNAMING]].

Just scrolling through here, I noticed that there was a debate a few months ago about whether the phrase "far right" could be used in the intro to describe InfoWars like so:

:InfoWars (stylized as INFOWARS) is a '''far right''' American conspiracy theorist and fake news website and media platform owned by Alex Jones's Free Speech Systems LLC.

based on the [[WP:RS|WP:RSes]]:

* https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/13/alex-jones-sued-charlottesville-claims-459244

It seemed like most editors in that discussion agreed with the descriptor, but because of historical objection decided to hold off until it could be properly decided by an Rfc. Then no one started an Rfc. I hate unfinished things, so here.

Should the first sentence of this article describe InfoWars as "far right"?

{{rfcquote|text=
We keep having discussions on this that peter out without reaching a clear consensus, so it is my hope that a formal RFC will bring in a broader set of editors and improve the state of affairs.

Historically this artwork has been credited as being by Marcel Duchamp. But, it was originally signed under a pseudonym and in the 1980s a letter was discovered in which Duchamp credited an unnamed female friend for the work. Many recent sources, including both popular press, academic journal articles, and the Tate Museum (see discussion), have felt it necessary to at least mention this issue. Several of these sources outline alternative theories for its authorship and the identity of this friend, including Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, Louise Norton, or a female alter ego of Duchamp himself. Our article, too, describes these alternative theories in its body, but the lead (which by [[MOS:LEAD]] should accurately summarize the body) instead flatly says "produced by Marcel Duchamp") and the lead image (redundantly) also says "by Marcel Duchamp" without qualification. We have had multiple past discussions on this issue but they have tended to peter out inconclusively, and then their lack of conclusion has been used repeatedly by editors {{u|Coldcreation}} and {{u|Modernist}} as a reason for keeping the status quo, with any changes to the lead being reverted with edit summaries like "needs to be settled at talk page" or "per talk". In the meantime, another editor {{u|Trishcan}} has entered the debate with an [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fountain_(Duchamp)&oldid=850592822 alternative lead] that in my mind goes too far in another direction, going into excessive detail in the lead about the authorship question and choosing sides in favor of Elsa.

So, can we have a wider discussion, please, on the following five questions:
#Should the alternative authorship theories be described in the body of the article, as they now are?
#Should the lead summarize that part of the article?
#Should the authorship of the artwork be mentioned at all in the caption of the lead image?
#If the answers to parts (1) and (2) are yes, is the proposed summary in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fountain_(Duchamp)&oldid=848582678 this old version of the lead] accurate or, if not, what changes are needed to make it conform to [[MOS:LEAD]]?
#Alternatively, is Trishcan's lead, crediting EvFL rather than Duchamp, a better starting point for a new lead?
We have also had discussions here about whether "(Duchamp)" is an accurate disambiguator for the article title but I would prefer to keep that out of the RFC for now.
For the record, my own answers to these questions are (1) yes, with no additional changes needed; (2) yes, (3) no, (4) yes, (5) no. (In more detail re 4 vs 5: We should teach the controversy rather than picking sides, per [[WP:NPOV]]. And I don't think it is currently the consensus of art scholarship that EvFL created it. Rather, there are still many scholars who hold to the Duchamp theory, and others who would more likely say that it's unclear rather than picking any alternative theory. So until such a consensus is formed I think saying so here is premature.) —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 21:41, 16 July 2018 (UTC)}}

At the present time [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tham_Luang_cave_rescue&oldid=852432173] we have a subsection consisting of two lengthy paragraphs, titled "Elon Musk," describing his work on a child-sized submarine to rescue the boys and how it was not used. There is also a description of the controversy it engendered, which included a war of words between Musk and one of the rescuers that raises BLP issues. Currently the amount of space devoted to the Musk controversy is significantly longer than the "Recovery" subsection devoted to the actual removal of the boys from the cave. The question is how much space should be devoted to this matter. I think reasonable choices are.

#''' The current amount of space.'''
#'''Far less space, just a few sentences, and no subsection.'''
#'''More space'''

 Consensus during a [[Template talk:Infobox song#Make it go away -- partial track listing|recent discussion]] was to remove partial track listings from song infoboxes.

Since the album is linked in the infobox, are these needed?  Many have already been replaced with album navboxes outside of the infoboxes.

{{rfcquote|text=
As seen above at [[Talk:Trypophobia#Latest changes]], there is disagreement on whether or not we should limit text to a source's exact words. In this regard, the question of whether it's [[WP:Original research]] to use our own wording as opposed to a source's exact words, and whether summarizing/paraphrasing material by using the word "some" needs to be tagged as [[WP:Weasel]], has come up. The disagreement additionally concerns extensively quoting from a source, free or not, and [[WP:YESPOV|stating things in Wikipedia's voice]] when sources disagree, the research is new, and/or there is no consensus in the literature on the matter.

Should we only use a source's exact wording? Is it WP:Original research to summarize/paraphrase a source without using the source's exact words? Should we quote extensively from a source, whether it's free or not? [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 19:16, 20 July 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
As seen in [[Talk:Domestic violence#NPOV discussion on Domestic violence#Gender differences|a section]] above this one, one view is that the article lends [[WP:Undue weight|undue weight]] to women as victims and/or their use of [[self-defense]] as a reason for domestic violence. This view argues that the prevalence of violence perpetrated by women is downplayed, and that quality sources support this. This view says that there should be more in the article about domestic violence against men and certain related debates. The other view is that the article reflects the general literature on this matter and is therefore WP:Due weight. The literature on domestic violence/[[intimate partner violence]] focuses significantly more on women than it does on men and states that domestic violence disproportionately affects women or that domestic violence victims are overwhelmingly women and that they suffer more severe consequences. It also significantly highlights self-defense as the main, or one of the main, reasons that women engage in domestic violence/intimate partner violence. Quality sources support this. Not every debate should be be included or get as much weight.  

So, for this RfC, the question is...does the article lend undue weight to women as victims and/or their use of self-defense as a reason for domestic violence? I'll alert [[WP:Women]], [[WP:Men]], [[WP:Sociology]] and [[WP:Med]] to this RfC. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 11:45, 21 July 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I made a proposal to edit the lead of the "Millennials" article from saying, "There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years", to "There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s to the mid 1990s as the cohort's birth years, with some extending the end of the cohort up to the early 2000s." Recently there has been new research regarding millennial end dates. Obviously this is not an exact science, but I feel that we need to constantly update the page with the most current consensus and new findings. We are currently having a discussion at the bottom of this talk page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Millennials. Please carefully read the discussion before commenting. Another request I have is to only include reliable, well researched sources from reputable people or organizations, and to cut down [[WP:UNDUE]] sources. However editor DynaGirl is claiming that these undue sources are from notable researchers and demographers and that “they have stood the test of time.” She is yet to give proper evidence to back up her claims besides restating the same things she has already said multiple times on different discussions. -[[User:Akhila3151996|Akhila3151996]] ([[User talk:Akhila3151996|talk]]) 07:08, 24 July 2018 (UTC)}}

Please note that per [[WP:NOTDIRECTORY]], Wikipedia does '''not''' use lists to create comprehensive [[WP:PRIMARYSOURCES|primary-sourced]] directories of "every non-notable thing in this class that happens to exist in the world" — Wikipedia lists (especially if they have open-ended inclusion criteria that invite hundreds or thousands of entries instead of a small defined number) are not free-for-all "web directories" of everything that ''exists'', but are finding aids for ''Wikipedia'' content. So the ''only'' appropriate entry on this list is the one that '''has a Wikipedia article to link to''', and padding the list out with non-notables, sourced only to their own [[WP:SELFPUB|self-published]] websites or the CHFC's directory of its member co-ops, is ''not'' an acceptable detour ''around'' the fact that there's no substantive reason to keep a list of just one thing. This was clearly an attempt to undercut an AFD discussion by turning the list into something Wikipedia lists are not supposed to be, and it is not acceptable.

 What is wikipedia current policy? [[User:power~enwiki|power~enwiki]]? I am thinking of inclusiveness as one of them. Why shouldn't it be a current policy here? It is not consensus that should rule, that is too simplistic. Inclusiveness should also be considered for fuller coverage. It almost sounds like including third or independent parties as something that shouldn't happen? This, as an encyclopedia, should have all of the situation of the elections in Ohio. I have noticed some who have colluded to purposely deny ANY third party access on other Wiki pages. If you look you will find it. It is happening as we speak.  To me it is deeply disturbing and should be to every wikipedian. [[User:bradv|bradv]] quoted me that wikipedia is not a democracy but I keep getting quoted info about polls as a basis for publishing. Democracy as in hearing people out is what's important. Publish the facts. So and so is running. Good! There are 5 candidates in Ohio. With only two pictures of them seems as though someone is playing favorites. Not a Democracy?, then no polls should be cited as an inclusive principle. Either way the poll argument is a fail, in that full information on THE candidates is not available. [[User:Dael4|Dael4]] ([[User talk:Dael4|talk]]) 04:05, 28 July 2018 (UTC)}}

  Currently this page attempts to differentiate 'legacy' and 'modern' chips. Can we instead combine the section to focus on as list of functions in the 7400s? First, this creates an arbitrary line between of the age of a part and does not denote whether the part is in production. Second, the 7400 is a 2-input NAND gate where all subsequent families used a 74xx00 as a the NAND function in the family. This would remove the need for the 1G-3G tables since 1G-3G parts are their are device families; this is because the LVC1G and the LVC device families are different technologies and can be seen in the voltage ranges of the devices.

The article currently quotes NPR as saying that Prager "targets multiculturalism, Muslims, and LGBTQ people." The NPR article in question also provides evidence for this claim. I have suggested that this evidence should be included in the piece to make it more informative what the NPR report is getting at. [[User:Ronz|Ronz]] disagrees, and apparently takes the view that while the assertion about Prager targeting these things is of encyclopedic value, the evidence for this claim about targeting is not of encyclopedic value. Ronz also believes that I should not pursue this matter further, as I am a new user. Perhaps he is right, and I apologize if I'm in violation of some policy. But, since I felt I had made a reasonable suggestion in good faith, I was hoping to get some more people to give a perspective on this matter.[[User:Shinealittlelight|Shinealittlelight]] ([[User talk:Shinealittlelight|talk]]) 01:00, 21 August 2018 (UTC)}}

Consider the European Left Party a far left group or the European Green Party a Left wing group and then consider the European People´s Party a centre-right one and ALDE a centre one is politically motivated. Almost all member parties in ALDE are centre-right, sometimes even more in the right than the EPP national counterpart. In the same way, consider the EPP just centre-right is not correct, there ir a more centre-right wing and a more right-wing one inside the party. EPP leaders of Slovenia, Bavaria, Hungary, Spain, France or Austria nowdays are clearly not centre-right.

Let´s be objective about this and don´t try to manipulate. Consider liberalism centre tries to demonize ideologies and parties coming from socialism. A true centrist party would be the one compromising socialism and liberalism, a liberal socialism as would say Norberto Bobbio. The PES and the EPP were centre- right and centre-left in the past because of social-democracy and christian-democracy builduing european welfare state system. since times have changed, new parties have arise, as well as new sociologial times, this has changed a bit, but the idea is the same. Classical liberalism or even neoliberalism is not the centre, because it is not a compromise of liberal socialism, it is a centre-right option that understands freedom only on its negative-freedom approach. In the same way, the more conservative, nationalistic, right-wing posittions of many EPP members cannot be avoided. --[[Special:Contributions/213.254.88.156|213.254.88.156]] ([[User talk:213.254.88.156|talk]]) 11:20, 31 July 2018 (UTC)}}

Opinions are requested as to whether the numeric colour values (RGB, HSV and Hexadecimal) in the various tables in this article are appropriate? Is this excessively detailed overcoverage? If such values are deemed potentially appropriate, further opinions are requested as to how they can be validly referenced to provide [[WP:V|verifiability]]. It has become clear (from discussion above) that these values were derived from colour swatches and sampled from websites in what I believe to be an act of [[WP:OR|original research]]. I believe the values to be unverified and also intrinsically unverifiable. As a glance at the discussion above will reveal, this is very strongly disputed with no consensus as the correct way to apply the policies, so opinions on this are requested. I have removed the value columns once and have been reverted. Ultimately, '''I would like to know whether to remove them again?'''

{{Infobox country

|government_type = [[Federation|Federal]] [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[Constitutionalism|constitutional]] [[Republic|republic]]}}

The past few days or weeks the previous government type description was shortened to just "Federal republic". This technically is correct but is definitely too simplistic and below the standards of the average Wikipedia article on a country. Just look at any article on a country and the government description is similar to the one I'm proposing we return to. Editors keep reverting changes to correct this, so I think we should have a consensus on what the proper terms to use are. - [[User:Bokmanrocks01|Bokmanrocks01]] ([[User talk:Bokmanrocks01|talk]]) 06:34, 15 August 2018 (UTC)}}

There was a tag on this page and [[Baconian method]] to merge this one into that one place in August 2018. I saw an old discussion with no real comment but saw the tag was recent so I went and did it. Hasty sure but bold and it seemed obvious to me that it should be done as the Baconian method is not so much a topic unto itself as one of many things covered in Novum Organum. My work was revert due to no discussion or consensus despite the similarity of the topic. The reverting editor had good point though, Novum Organum ought to be the page that remains if a merger is to occur. So I figured flipping the merger proposal and tagging an RfC would be a good way to drum up some conversation.

Obviously I support a merger since I went ahead and did the work, which can be seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baconian_method&oldid=853888843 here]. Although I definitely didn't finish. Also, the new merge would clearly be different then what I did given they would be going together in the opposite direction. I contend that it's basically the same content but on the Baconian method page there is less of it and also some irrelevant stuff.

What do we think would work? I consensus is leave the separate I'll work on a separate improvement of Baconian method or just move on to another project but I'd like to merge them. [[User:Rap Chart Mike|Rap Chart Mike]] ([[User talk:Rap Chart Mike|talk]]) 19:04, 9 August 2018 (UTC)}}

I searched the archives of both here and [[WP:VPP]] and couldn't find much, so I apologise if this has been discussed recently. From what I can tell, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_policy&diff=next&oldid=109283992 this] is the beginning of WP:ATD in its present form, and it has remained largely the same ever since, albeit with a few additions and amendments over the years. I don't know if it had consensus, and I see no point in trying to find out, because it won't change anything even if there was consensus: it's the consensus of today that matters, not the consensus of 11 years ago. And I'm not entirely convinced that the community actually agrees with its status as policy: there are many, many cases of what would appear to be [[WP:IGNORINGATD]] cases (which I actually find a bit strange as I was under the impression that [[WP:ATA]] is a widely accepted essay on deletion?).

*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cad-Capture Group]] - Client of a notable organisation, yet no-one even considered [[WP:ATD-M]] or [[WP:ATD-R]].
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Vergenoegd Primary School]] - A redirect per [[WP:ATD-R]] would still have fixed the problem.
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tuncay Öztürk]] - This was speedied as G7, but that aside, [[WP:ATD-M]] or [[WP:ATD-R]] were likely still applicable (see [[WP:INVALIDBIO]])
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Art of Problem Solving]] - Again, redirection would also have solved the problem.
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lifoti]] - Notable (or so it was thought at the time) founder, but no merge or redirect for whatever reason (it should be noted that the founder's article was later deleted).
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Grace (musical group)]] - Notable member, yet I was the only one who even mentioned an alternative to deletion. Also, despite ATD, [[WP:FAILN]], and even CSD policy itself (which does say ATD applies), my A7 decline on those grounds was "invalid reasoning".
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe (website)]] - You could be forgiven for thinking '''''I''''' was in the wrong just by mentioning alternatives! I'll let the AfD and [[User_talk:Adam9007/Archive_2#Notability_is_not_inherited|this "discussion"]] do the rest of the talking.
*[[GF Biochemicals]] - Here we likely had [[WP:ATD-E]] and [[WP:ATD-I]], but even in the worst case scenario, we had [[WP:ATD-R]]. But A7 prevailed per [[WP:NOTINHERITED]]. It was restored, not because it was decided the A7 was wrong, but because someone wanted to improve it. In fact, if memory serves, there was a pretty much unanimous consensus that it indeed ''should'' have been speedied under A7.  If I remember right, [[WP:ATD]] occurred to no-one (myself included if I'm not mistaken!). 
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Data Networking/Spring 2017/]] - [[WP:ATD-TRANS]] was obvious, but nope.
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Camp Camp]] - While this ''was'' redirected, from what I can tell it was entirely at the closer's discretion. Consensus was to delete and no alternative was considered.
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ajit Gunewardene (2nd nomination)]] - No redirect, going against [[WP:ATD-R]] and [[WP:INVALIDBIO]].
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Xtian de Medici]] - {{tquote|The topic is already covered in [[Gunner_de_Medici]]}}. So why not redirect there?
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Deep Eddy Vodka Distillery]] - {{tquote|the Heaven Hill article already mentions the brand}}. {{tquote|The parent article already mentions it}}. Same as above.
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Levi Sanders]] - Could have been redirected to his notable parent, but that wasn't talked about (another target was proposed, but that wasn't to be either).
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hurricane (group)]] - Apparently had a notable member, but wasn't merged or redirected.

There are likely many more out there (i do remember articles having merge/redirect targets getting speedied under A7, but can't remember what they were). I also noticed that an admin said [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)/Archive_140#Pruning/blanking_abandoned_very_bad_articles|here]] that many editors ignore ATD entirely, and I have to concur. I have to question [[WP:ATD]]'s status as policy, if it's ignored so easily so often. I can think of no other policy where you can easily get away with pretending it doesn't exist. ATD may be a good principle, but from what I can see it's far from a "widely accepted standard that all editors should normally follow". Policy is supposed to reflect the norm. not dictate it, no?

'''Should schools be disambiguated in the form "Name High School, Town" or "Name High School (Town)"?'''
My preference is to use a single comma, but two editors have commented this style is improper (without pointing to anywhere in the guidelines). A school doesn't fit well into either [[WP:NCCORP]] or [[WP:NCPLACE]]. In my view, a single comma is the most natural way to disambiguate, and in any case using brackets is grammatically incorrect (strictly it should be "Name High School (high school in Town)").

"Our mission is to Occupy Democrats on November 2018 AND BEYOND by voting in a LANDSLIDE of progressive Democratic candidates dedicated to rolling back President Trump’s extremist agenda." This is my aim too, but it does not mark them out as a reliable source for anything. It's a political activist movement, not even a formally constituted political party, and there is little or no accountability for what is said in Occupy's name or  Most links are now removed (by me and others, over a long period), and few of these removals have been challenged. It's my view that we should not source anything to Occupy other than strictly factual and uncontroversial facts about Occupy on the articles related to Occupy and related people - if a claim is not covered in more reliable sources then it's not significant and probably [[WP:UNDUE]], if it is, we should use them instead. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 12:40, 2 September 2018 (UTC)}}

For example, can we use a source about the safety of e-cigarettes when the source did not indicate the safety information about e-cigarettes being discussed is in relation to the marketing of e-cigarettes?

Before last night no dedicated article existed for the two PA congressional special elections that will be taking place this November. I created this one last night, and decided to create a single article for both elections. Here are my reasons for doing so
#I can't remember the last time two congressional special elections took place in the same state on the same day, so had no precedent to go off of.
#The elections are being held under the 2011 PA map which was invalidated by ''LWV v. PA'', meaning that the districts will functionally cease to exist the moment the election is certified.
#In addition, these are elections to the [[Lame-duck session]] of the [[115th United States Congress]], so the winners of these special elections will be serving their districts for a maximum of 2 months, lowering the stakes of these particular elections.
#The nominees for both parties are the same as the successor districts for the regular 2018 elections.

So: '''keep''' merged or '''separate'''? I welcome your comments. '''[[User:Nevermore27|<span style="color: #660198">Nevermore27</span>]]''' ([[User talk:Nevermore27|talk]]) 00:30, 6 August 2018 (UTC)}}

However, these talk redirects have been opposed by editors trying to impliment article assessment templates ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_people_who_disappeared_mysteriously%3A_pre-1970&type=revision&diff=858218825&oldid=858214945 example]).

A lot of the mountains at [[:Category:Mountains of Oppland]] are stubs with little or no facts beyond their stats.  I have checked a couple of them and their sources may not satisfy [[WP:GEOLAND]], which states that

{{cquote|Named natural features are often notable, '''provided information beyond statistics and coordinates is known to exist.''' This includes mountains, lakes, streams, islands, etc. '''The number of known sources should be considered to ensure there is enough verifiable content for an encyclopedic article.''' If a Wikipedia article cannot be developed using known sources, information on the feature can instead be included in a more general article on local geography. '''For example, a river island with no information available except name and location should probably be described in an article on the river.'''}} 

While the mountains might be named, it would fail that criteria because of the bolded parts.

The difference between the two is that '''Proposed text #1''' is for all blocked users, while '''Proposed text #2''' is for all indefinitely blocked users.

*The current policy language makes it sound as if what we would do in most cases is discuss the violation. 
*It’s been pretty long-standing practice at UAA that any blatant ORGNAME that has edited gets soft blocked. It is basically the tool of first resort, due to the fact that ORGNAMEs are by far the most common thing reported there and discussing with all of them would likely be a huge waste of time whereas soft blocking only takes a few seconds. 

So, since as they say policies should reflect practice, not dictate it, should language be added to the policy regarding the established practice of blocking ORGNAMEs that have made even one edit that signals a violation?

There is a dispute about the roles that should be included in the lead sentence. Which of the following is preferred for the lead sentence:

At this time, I think the article is adequately [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]-compliant on the topic of ROGD. However, it is clearly {{em|not}} NPOV-compliant on the topic of [[Lisa Littman]], the nominal subject of the page. It's still a [[WP:BLP|BLP]] that has instead become a [[WP:coatrack|coatrack]] for a [[WP:RECENT]] controversy, resulting in serious issues including [[WP:BALASP]].

Despite legitimate concerns about [[WP:RECENT|recentism]] and [[WP:NOTNEWS]], I think we have a consensus that the ROGD content of this article belongs in Wikipedia, {{em|somewhere}}. But there's no consensus about what action should be taken.

These are the possibilities that I see, and I'm inviting a discussion under each heading.

I'm asking this [[User talk:Molecule Extraction#Pakatan Harapan colors: Is it red or light blue?|on behalf of the user who asking me in my talkpage]] regarding the colour that was used by the [[Pakatan Harapan]] (PH) coalition in the recent election. While it is acknowledged that the red colour (#C63B38 colour pattern) has been part of the colour symbol of PH coalition, the coalition [https://sg.news.yahoo.com/finally-pakatan-harapan-gets-registered-105315110.html was recently legalised when they won the 9 May election] with the colour began to be used officially. During the election, each parties in the coalition contesting using the flag of [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|People's Justice Party]] (PKR) with blue colour (#00ADEF colour pattern) for West Malaysia, while in East Malaysia each parties are free to use their respective flags with their own party colours.

What is the best term for Carina's relationship to the Collector in ''Guardians of the Galaxy''? 
*One side prefers '''''slave''''', since Carina is mistreated, seemingly unable to escape her situation, and at one point says "I will no longer be your slave." 
*The other side objects to this, preferring '''''assistant''''' or '''''aide''''', arguing that the quote is insufficient evidence because she could have used the term in a hyperbolic fashion. 
Sourcing is somewhat mixed on the matter, though there appears to be a slight bias towards ''slave''.

'''Discussion'''

*'''Yes''' - I've long wondered why we don't disallow highlighting in signatures. I get wanting flexibility for users to express themselves in different ways (obviously, I use some custom formatting in my own), and I would say that using different colors for the text seems reasonable. Using text highlighting does not. I find highlighted text incredible distracting to the point I have trouble focusing on the discussion as a whole, and trouble seeing the signatures of other participants. I suspect I'm not alone in that. We should not let signatures pull eyeballs from the substance of the discussion to draw focus on a single user's name. I've thought about proposing this RfC several times in the past, but looking at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Categories,_lists,_and_navigation_templates&oldid=859237467 this page] just now reminded me of how awful the effect is to my concentration. I imagine I'm not alone, but I suppose it's possible. (Sorry to {{u|woodensuperman}}, with whom I have no quarrel, but whose signature is the one I'm talking about on that page. It's not the most egregious I've ever seen, but all I see are woodensuperman billboards all over the page). &mdash; <samp>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></samp> \\ 18:56, 12 September 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The article is written like a textbook on how to eradicate '''Suicide''' from a society, which is at the least offensive and at the most frightening to any who believe in a fundamental inalienable [[right to die]]. Having read [[WP:Offensive]], [[WP:IAR]] would apply for the sake of allowing others to form their own moral opinions, even if neutrality wasn't already a rule. Due-weight doesn't apply here, because no where in [[WP:NPOV]] have wikipedians collectively decided wikipedia's editorial voice should associate moral imperatives belonging to the predominant point-of-view with rigorously cited consensus and [[MOS:Alleged]] facts by how they are told--often by clumping facts useful one particular goal or another next to each other especially in the lede--even if that point-of-view as well as its moral imperatives are enforced by law in many reputable countries. Wikipedians wouldn't hypothetically allow Chinese officials write a communism article that clumps facts useful to writing communist law in the lede, why should suicide be any different?

The medical infobox also carries significant bias (like if an invented "eugenics" infobox plagued articles about ethnicities), though there isn't really a suitable substitute. I would say whatever infobox eventually appears on [[Fetishism]] would do, however in the meanwhile perhaps no infobox or [[Template:Infobox performing art]] instead?

If you disagree, please leave the banner up for at least a week or so to invited discussion from non-wikipedians. <s>I'm IP-editing</s> so I won't get notifications about this article and I don't want to get too emotionally invested. 04:07, 31 August 2018 (UTC)}}

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

We have an ensuing edit war in this article ([[Sofia Airport]]) which I would like your help in resolving. As a result you can also help clarify Wikipedia general policy on the matter.

I, and other users, claim that future routes in an article about an airport or airline - when properly referenced by an independent source e.g. an article in a neutral news site - is valid encyclopedic information. It is in fact common practice in airport articles across Wikipedia. As a result, we have been adding such information to this and other articles.

One other user claims the opposite, that all future route information is unencyclopedic and constitutes advertising and promotional information. As a result that user has been deleting all such information from this article, even when referenced to an independent source, and intends to do that in articles of other airports as well.

You can check out the history of the page for more details.

Your comments and clarifications are welcome. [[User:Tdunsky|Tdunsky]] ([[User talk:Tdunsky|talk]]) 05:46, 14 August 2018 (UTC)}}

'''Option 1)''' Include the following material, in a subsection ("2011 rapes") of the History section:
{{Quote box|quote = In 2011, 19 suspects were arrested for repeated gang rapes of an 11-year-old girl after identification from cell phone video they recorded of one incident.<ref name="apcourt">{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20050743-504083.html | work=CBS News | author=Edecio Martinez | title=Cleveland, Texas gang rape suspects appear in court | date=April 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/us/09assault.html?_r=1&hp |title=Vicious Assault Shakes Texas Town |author=James C.

{{Quote box|quote = Ultimately, 21 persons were charged in the case. Two suspects requested jury trials. They were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison (in one case) and 99 years in prison (in the other). Eleven pled guilty to sexual assault of a child and received 15-year sentences; one pled guilty to indecency with a child by exposure and received a seven-year sentence. The seven juveniles involved in the rapes all entered guilty pleas and received seven years of probation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/news/why-does-quanell-x-support-some-rape-victims-but-shame-others-6713494 |title=Why Does Quanell X Support Some Rape Victims But Shame Others? |author=Angelica Leicht |date=December 19, 2014 |work=Houston Press |accessdate=December 13, 2016}}</ref>}}
{{reflist}}

'''Option 2)''' A shorter description, maybe a couple sentences, at the end of the History section and not in a separate subsection. Something maybe like:

{{Quote box|quote  = In 2011, 19 young men and teens from Cleveland were arrested for repeated gang rapes of an 11-year-old girl. Ultimately, 21 persons were found or pled guilty and received sentences ranging from life in prison to probation. [appropriate refs]}}

'''Option 3)''' Break out the material (basically the option 1 material from above) into a separate article.

'''Option 4)''' Nothing, no mention.

'''Option 5)''' Other, describe. [[User:Herostratus|Herostratus]] ([[User talk:Herostratus|talk]]) 00:27, 17 August 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The use of the phrase "assigned at birth" and "assigned sex" is redundant and implies that there can be a different '''sex''' from the one a person is born with. Bypassing any opinions on "gender" as it is used in this article, it is biologically impossible to change one's '''sex'''. There is a [[Sex and gender distinction|WP article]] on this distinction (again, I am writing this in terms of the current WP world and do not intend to make a political/moral statement about this topic). 

I move and RfC that the statements containing these phrases should be reworded to reflect definition and the intended wikivoice here. An example:

::"Different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match up with the norm of their sex assigned at birth."

::To: "Different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match up with the normal attributes of their sex."

Again, even the [[Assigned sex|WP article on assigned sex]] is about the determination of a person's sex, and this sex cannot change. Gender is a separate beast here. I do think that perhaps for wikilinking purposes, it can be included once in the article, but it makes no sense to me to have it repeated in this fashion over and over, especially given that it could confuse the uninitiated reader about the accepted distinction between gender and sex.

This article is long and has a large focus on the history of hip-hop music. As articles are meant to be encyclopedic, this content is too dense and it may be worth looking into splitting some of it off into a new article (e.g. "Origins of hip hop music" or "History of hip hop music").

It is helpful to put yourself into the shoes of the average viewer. I would wager to guess that someone looking for an encyclopedic article on hip hop music ''''might'''' not want to read 20,000 words on the intricate and detailed history of the genre. This article needs generalization.

Let's RfC on a possible future preparation and move-rename of this page to "History of hip hop music" and linked creation of a new "Hip hop music" article. This would take a while, of course. Let me know what you think. - [[User:Dmezh|Dmezh]] ([[User talk:Dmezh|talk]]) 06:13, 20 August 2018 (UTC)}}

I would like to request an rfc on whether to update the template to pull in Wikdiata information. I do that their was an ArbCom notice back in November of last year about establishing need for it. I would like to suggest that this template be updated to use and pull the Wikidata information, such as the identifier id for it. While some may say why rely on Wikidata, while we should not you need to realize that most of our infobox's pull stuff from Wikidata especially those on our other language versions of Wikipedia, as that is why that project was founded as a catalog of information to make putting information into templates and connecting pages across the language spectrum easier. We don't need to update the template to only pull information from Wikidata but of course allow still the usage of putting the identifier id in manually. Some may think that opens it up to cross project vandalism, well maybe so but Wikidata does have active editors and admins that maintain it. --[[User:Clarkcj12|Clarkcj12]] ([[User talk:Clarkcj12|talk]]) 03:42, 29 August 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The article is written like a textbook on how to eradicate '''Suicide''' from a society, which is at the least offensive and at the most frightening to any who believe in a fundamental inalienable [[right to die]]. Having read [[WP:Offensive]], [[WP:IAR]] would apply for the sake of allowing others to form their own moral opinions, even if neutrality wasn't already a rule. Due-weight doesn't apply here, because no where in [[WP:NPOV]] have wikipedians collectively decided wikipedia's editorial voice should associate moral imperatives belonging to the predominant point-of-view with rigorously cited consensus and [[MOS:Alleged]] facts by how they are told--often by clumping facts useful one particular goal or another next to each other especially in the lede--even if that point-of-view as well as its moral imperatives are enforced by law in many reputable countries. Wikipedians wouldn't hypothetically allow Chinese officials write a communism article that clumps facts useful to writing communist law in the lede, why should suicide be any different?

The medical infobox also carries significant bias (like if an invented "eugenics" infobox plagued articles about ethnicities), though there isn't really a suitable substitute. I would say whatever infobox eventually appears on [[Fetishism]] would do, however in the meanwhile perhaps no infobox or [[Template:Infobox performing art]] instead?

If you disagree, please leave the banner up for at least a week or so to invited discussion from non-wikipedians. <s>I'm IP-editing</s> so I won't get notifications about this article and I don't want to get too emotionally invested. 04:07, 31 August 2018 (UTC)}}

The question is should the former sections entitled Australian flag at war and Centenary and other notable flags be featured on the flag of Australia page or elsewhere?

The "Australian flag at war" and "Centenary and other notable flags" sections have been removed ostensibly on the grounds that the material is POV and trivial. But I see that the sources were all non partisan and verifiable and the presentation was encyclopedic. The only what you might call hyperbole comes from direct quotes. And how trivial could some of this content be given the large number of references that were supplied? For example just look at the entry for the "parliament house centenary flag" for one. Some of these national treasures such as the "Australian moon flag" are even notable enough to warrant a separate article of their own really.

Should we stop having AfD renominations at separate pages named "2nd nomination", "3rd nomination", etc., and instead just place renominations under previous nominations at the original AfD page? This has been suggested by [[User:Kaldari|Kaldari]] at [[phab:T169441]]. If so, then this would make it consistent with renominations on Wikimedia Commons. Also, if this RfC passes, then the aforementioned Phabricator task should be closed as declined. And MfDs should then be treated similar to AfDs, with new nominations under old ones. Finally, Twinkle would then be modified to edit the original AfD or MfD page instead of creating a new one.

::::MR X. no, everyone does not agree with your statement nor the sources  as some have stated that they are both too vague and opinionative, the date is arbitrary (on a side note I would bet even the author of the New Yorker article would agree with that) and i'm going add both are bias against chick fi la. Also, what I stated initially is still true. The other secondary sources (which are obviously bias and anti chick fi la) that were added were disagreed with then just put back in. The current statement was disagreed with then added too as well. It is like the people who disagreed with the statement/source did not have the power to edit because the page was locked but the people who agree with it came in and edited it because they did have the power. 

Most importantly, Chick fi la has only donated to only 1-2 anti lbgt groups since 2012  which is a significant decrease since they were exposed. This page doesn't state that at all. The qutoe say "groups" pulling from the new yorker (again with the gross vagaries) when we have secondary source articles stating the specific groups (only one or two) they actually donate too. This makes chick fi la sound a lot worse than it is, hence the bias. We have other secondary sources with better more specific information than the new yorker piece. If this particular  New Yorker article was not written as a satirical, slanderous, op-ed piece then I would say leave it, but it is. 

The source and statement still most be changes and be replaced with more the more specific, non bias articles mentioned in this thread such as the business insider and goqnotes (an article on chick fi la from a queer website) articles.

Per {{reply to|Only in death}}'s request, I have formally included a request for comments regarding Lori Maddox's inclusion in this article. The reasons I give are listed in the above "Lori Maddox" section. To summarize them briefly, his involvement with her is well-documented. Even the [[Rolling Stone]] publication has admitted to the facts of the nature of their relationship. The biggest reason she has NOT been included, according to the discussion above, is because of the back-and-forth edit warring that went on regarding HOW to include her. I believe that the difficulties in reaching an agreement on how to include her in the article do not justify leaving her out altogether.

For the reasons above, I have created this request for comments to answer the following question: **Should Lori Maddox be mentioned in the article?** (We can leave the "how" to a later discussion IF the consensus here is "yes." For now, I just want to see if there is a consensus that she SHOULD be included). Obviously my vote is "yes." [[User:Et0048|Et0048]] ([[User talk:Et0048|talk]]) 19:44, 5 September 2018 (UTC)}}

The guideline '''currently contains the following wording''':

{{talkquote|The point of these template boxes is not to list every single redirect for any given page (indeed, that's what [[Special:WhatLinksHere]] is for); instead, they generally should list only one or two common and easily remembered redirects.}}

This guideline has been largely ignored by the community for almost ten years and for good reasons, so I changed this to 

{{talkquote|The point of these template boxes is not to list every single redirect for any given page (indeed, that's what [[Special:WhatLinksHere]] is for); instead, they generally should list <del>only one or two</del> <ins>the most</ins> common and easily remembered redirects.}}

but was reverted.

I thus formerly '''propose this change be implemented''' as it reflects standard and current practice as evidenced by [[WP:V]], [[WP:NOT]], [[WP:DEL]], [[WP:EP]] and [[WP:NPOV]] to name but a few core policy pages. While listing all possible shortcuts is overkill, it's also [[WP:COMMONSENSE]] that there should not be an artificial limit. If a page has four common shortcuts, they should be listed and if it only has one, so be it. Removing shortcuts solely for the sake of removing a certain number strikes me as [[WP:BURO|following the letter of the rules for the sake of following the rules without thought of whether doing so really improves the project]] (something, ironically, I have been accused of in the past).

'''This RFC is ''only'' about whether the wording should be changed from "only one or two" to "the most". '''

* RFC Text:

The current guidelines were adopted around 15 years ago and have led to numerous editorial contradictions and circular discussions. This means the guidelines don't work properly and need updating. It is even questionable whether there ever has been a consensus created. I hope a healthy debate will follow here first. Many other editors who use the various county related sites should also be advised of this discussion, and someone might also begin a [[wp:RfC|Request for Comment]].

The current guidelines are factually incorrect in claiming the historic counties no longer exist. This is probably the route cause of most of the problem. The use of the word 'county' to refer to different things comes a close second. Change will not be easy because there are so many inter-connected articles and assumptions, but change is necessary. We must keep any changes simple and not get trapped into discussing the minutiae. However, precision is important, because the lack of it has led to the current muddle. I very much think we should avoid discussing at any length whether historic counties exist of not. Some people just don't get it so we are better off just accepting that and moving forward. I propose the following:

'''1/ When referring to a county, the default meaning is the traditional/historic county'''. Different meanings of any name are qualified by such words as Essex (Ceremonial county). It is more often than not that confusion arises by using the ceremonial county as the default, even though it was originally thought this would not be the case.

This means, for example, there will be an article named Essex dealing with the historic county and one called Essex (Ceremonial county) dealing with the more recent area. The current Essex article will not change much, and would have a small sub-section on recent local govt, referring to the CC article: the new article, Essex (CC) would deal only with that county, mainly local government. This is no different from countless other article topics.

'''2/  Have separate articles for the different types of county'''. Combining everything together is not practically possible without making [[wp:pov|POV]] assumptions that trigger the endless edit wars. Inserting opinions and false information not backed by the evidence or by closer examination does Wikipedia a dis-service.

'''3/  Use the term 'traditional' county (as does the govt), because 'historic' can be confusing.''' The use of the word historic has caused much of the misunderstanding that has created the confusion.

...If we adopt these two changes alone, there will be limited need to change the numerous contradictions in the articles because the changes once made will easily lead to the fairly quick ironing out by editors of so many problems caused by the current way of handling counties. There will be problems relating to each county but they will be reasonably easy to deal with once we have adopted point 1 above.

I'd like to propose amending our naming format for elections/referendums to move the year to the front of the title; so, for example, [[French presidential election, 2017]] would be [[2017 French presidential election]]. I think this has several advantages:
#It brings election articles in line with the vast majority of other articles with years in the title
#It allows the article titles to be used in prose, as the current format cannot be used (one could say "the [[2017 German federal election]] resulted in a hung parliament")
#It would make certain election articles titles more logical (for instance [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2018]] would become [[2018 United States Senate election in Florida]]
#It would make the titles of related articles more logical (for instance [[Fundraising in the United States presidential election, 2016]] would become [[Fundraising in the 2016 United States presidential election]])
#It would automatically sort elections by year in categories

I mentioned this a year ago at [[WP:E&R]] and a valid point was raised that currently you can start searching "French presidential election" and you get the whole list. This is an advantage, but as far as I can see, the only one. A way to keep this benefit is to still create redirects from these titles.

This will involve moving many thousands of articles (I will notify as many relevant WPs as I can find), so I propose that if this passes, a bot run is set up to do it.

At this time, I think the article is adequately [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]-compliant on the topic of ROGD. However, it is clearly {{em|not}} NPOV-compliant on the topic of [[Lisa Littman]], the nominal subject of the page. It's still a [[WP:BLP|BLP]] that has instead become a [[WP:coatrack|coatrack]] for a [[WP:RECENT]] controversy, resulting in serious issues including [[WP:BALASP]].

Despite legitimate concerns about [[WP:RECENT|recentism]] and [[WP:NOTNEWS]], I think we have a consensus that the ROGD content of this article belongs in Wikipedia, {{em|somewhere}}. But there's no consensus about what action should be taken.

These are the possibilities that I see, and I'm inviting a discussion under each heading. <small><span style="color:#0;border:0;font-weight:normal;padding:0 1px 0 1px;text-shadow:1px 4px 8px #F70,-8px -6px 10px #ee7f2d,1px 1px 1px #FFF;">[[User:Lwarrenwiki|Lwarrenwiki]] ([[User talk:Lwarrenwiki|talk]])</span></small> 19:46, 7 September 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
This is a proposal to put all AfC status templates, maintenance templates, comments, and such on the draft talk page instead of the draft page, where they currently are. This would enable reviewers and draft authors to hold normal conversations on the talk page, and would (as a side effect) retain all conversation if the draft is moved to mainspace. A general disclaimer-style AfC banner will remain on the draft page, informing readers that the draft is not an article yet. A script (or Lua template) can also be written to summarize the status of the draft so far, for use by reviewers and others interested in AfC reviewing operations. Robert McClenon was the most recent person to suggest this, and this issue has also come up in the past before then.

{{rfcquote|text=
There is an issue currently with the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion policy]] (PROD) which is causing some confusion and ambiguity. In January this year, user {{ul|Green Giant}} [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Proposed_deletion&diff=next&oldid=823134643 boldly edited the policy] to simplify the wording, but in doing so, changed the ''suggestion'' to notify article creators to a ''requirement''. It appears as though this was not compelled by any discussion to make that change, and it was also certainly in good faith and possibly not intended to have changed the meaning in this way. Up until this change, our various deletion policies all suggested notifying article creators and significant contributors as a courtesy, but did not require it (and requiring AfD notification is a [[Wikipedia:Perennial proposals#All authors must be notified of deletion|perennial proposal]]). With Green Giant's change, PROD stands out as the only deletion process requiring notification. The change has also not been well publicized or recognized - this post is inspired by an editor reported to ANI for failing to notify, and several editors and administrators responding that they were not aware of the change.

I am proposing a <s>three-pronged</s> discussion/straw poll to determine the community's current opinions about proposed deletion. Please comment in one of the sections below.

Recently, the paragraphs in the lead were [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kind_of_Blue&type=revision&diff=796808681&oldid=796668435 rearranged] by {{u|Lawrencekhoo}}, so that information about the album's release date, recording, and the musician's concept for the album were replaced in the first paragraph with information about how the album has been critically received, accolades, and so forth. Lawrencekhoo cited the guideline that the lead should establish notability of the topic. In restoring the original layout, I cited [[MOS:LEAD]] which says the lead paragraph "should establish the context in which the topic is being considered by supplying the set of circumstances or facts that surround it," and in my opinion, critical opinions are not facts. The practice throughout WP:ALBUMS articles appears to prioritize the original layout here, but admittedly my opinion is not a strong one when reading: "The notability of the article's subject is usually established in the first few sentences. Like in the body of the article itself, the emphasis given to material in the lead should roughly reflect its importance to the topic, according to reliable, published sources." So I'm not sure.

* '''Claim A:''' [[Coldwave]] is a subgenre of dark wave
*: '''Source:''' "{{tq|Dark Wave is a [...] generic term for dark varieties of the Wave, which also subsumes Gothic. Cold Wave is a subgenus of experimental, minimalist electronic music from France.}}" (translated from German)
* '''Claim B:''' Some instruments that are common to dark wave include guitar, bass guitar, drum machine, cello, piano, and samplers
*: '''Source:''' same as above
* '''Claim C:''' [[Neofolk]] is a subgenre of dark wave
*: '''Source:''' "{{tq|The dark wave scene is divided among other things in the classic dark wave, gothic rock, electronic groups or even the neofolk.}}" (translated from German)
* '''Claim D:''' Dark wave borrows elements from the [[post-industrial]] genre.
*: '''Source:''' "{{tq|At first, there wasn't the same sort of [Goth] scene and we were in more of an '[[industrial music|industrial]]' thing. There was nothing like the clubs you get now [...] it's not just Goth, it's a mix - Darkwave or whatever.}}" [http://sortedmagazine.com/archive/magazine/sordid/attrition.htm]
*  '''Claim E''': Gary Numan and Depeche Mode were associated with gothic rock and synthesizer-based new wave music
*: '''Source:''' "{{tq|The term "darkwave" came from back in the 1980s, and was one of the terms used to describe [the] Golden Age [of gothic rock] bands, as well as dark electronica acts like Gary Numan and Depeche Mode.}}" [http://www.houstonpress.com/music/the-seven-ages-of-goth-6500894]

''' Web content by non-staff contributors '''

{{Shortcut|WP:CONTRIBUTOR|WP:CONTRIBUTORS}}
On [[Online newspaper|news websites]], [[periodical]] websites (excluding [[academic journals]]), and [[blog]]s, [[web content]] authored by non-staff [[Freelancer|contributors]] is questionable, even if it is published in a source that is otherwise reliable. Compared to [[staff writer]]s, contributors are subject to reduced editorial oversight and have a lesser reputation for fact-checking and error correction. Reliable publications distinguish articles written by staff writers from ones written by contributors by indicating the author's job title in the [[byline]]. Less reputable sources only display the author's job title on their profile page or the website's [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]].

Examples of sources that publish content from non-staff contributors include [[WP:RSP#Forbes.com contributors|Forbes.com]] and ''[[WP:RSP#HuffPost contributors|HuffPost]]''.

[[Opinion piece]]s in reliable sources have their [[#Statements of opinion|own guideline]], which applies in addition to this one.

About 2 or 3 years ago, on a related WikiProject page (I can't exactly remember which), it was ''agreed'' to use <u>Nominator</u>, rather then <u>Appointer</u> in the infoboxes of justices & judges, for what the president's role was in the person getting on to a court seat. Though I've just noticed that over the last little while, 'someone' had been gradually changing 'nominator' to appointer' for the lower court judges? the Supreme Court chief justices & associate justices continued to use 'nominator', until today (concerning the most recent & current). Therefore, for consistency sake, can we ''again'' come to a consensus on which terminology to use for '''all''' these bios?

There is disagreement on whether or not to use [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f0/Kate-winslet_titanic_movie_pencil-drawing.jpg this] image (which is cropped and does not show Rose fully nude) or [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/f/f0/20181027010603%21Kate-winslet_titanic_movie_pencil-drawing.jpg this] one (which does show her fully nude). One view is that we should go with the non-cropped version because of [[WP:NOTCENSORED]]. The other view is that WP:NOTCENSORED is tempered by [[Wikipedia:Offensive material]], and it guides editors to not unnecessarily include the more offensive image if an equally suitable alternative is available. 

'''Survey'''

*'''Cropped version'''. Above, I noted that I personally have no problem with the image that JeffyP uploaded, but some of our readers will, and no one has given a valid reason for going with it over the cropped one I uploaded years ago. I work on a number of sexual topics, and readers commonly object to images of bare breasts and images of genitals. The cropped image of the nude Rose is therefore the less offensive of the two options, and it has caused no issues while the one that JeffyP undoubtedly will. I know from experience that we will have readers and editors wanting to remove the fully nude image. And no one has given a valid reason as to why the fully nude image is better than the cropped image with regard to enhancing readers' understanding of the text.

This RfC concerns [[Same-sex marriage#Opposition|this]] section of the article. It [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Same-sex_marriage&oldid=861550888#Opposition currently] states, "''These claims are refuted by science which shows that homosexuality is a natural and normal human sexuality, that sexual orientation cannot be chosen or influenced, and that the children of same-sex couples fare just as well or even better than the children of opposite-sex couples.''" One view is that current sourcing for the final sentence in the first paragraph of the section should be trimmed because it is extreme [[WP:Citation overkill]] (ending with 21 citations), and also that the sentence partly misrepresents the literature since scientists have not ruled out the influence of social factors on sexual orientation; rather, with regard to social factors, they state "weak evidence," "unlikely to influence" and "no substantive evidence," or "a complex combination of biological and social factors." Both parenting and child abuse are seen by scientists as very unlikely to influence sexual orientation, however. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Same-sex_marriage&oldid=861547939#Opposition This] version of the section trimmed the sourcing to six citations and uses "unlikely to be influenced by social factors such as parenting or child abuse," with a source to support it. The other view is that WP:Citation overkill is an essay rather than a policy or a guideline and that [[WP:Consensus]] is needed to change the text.

Traditionally, we have handled reports on users with mild violations and no edits by placing them in the holding pen. After sitting there for a week or two these reports are reviewed again to see if they have edited in the meantime. This strikes me as needless busywork and I would suggest we change the procedure so that adding the “wait” response to a report is considered declining the report and it is simply removed a while later like other declined reports, leaving only “being discussed with user” and “keep monitoring” as the only reports that go to holding. Having reviewed hundreds if not thousands of such reports I feel the risk is fairly low, usually if they don’t edit the day the create the account they don’t edit at all. In the rare cases where they do edit, they can be re-reported at UAA and blocked. [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 18:09, 6 October 2018 (UTC)}}

Hi, short summary: Question: "Was there Norse habitat on the island of Ösel during the viking era?" Some editors like me and several others claim there are no sources for this. Some editors claim there was Norse habitat on the island of Ösel. The question is about updating the map in question (linked above and in the article), which currently claims there was Norse habitat, but does not include sources. [[File_talk:Viking_Expansion.svg#Areas_in_Estonia|The connected talk page with opinions is here]]. There is also a talk discussion thread on this talk page above. This is connected to the wider topic of "Who were the [[Oeselians]]?", who were also called "Vikings from Estonia". The main options have been either "we don't know" or "Estonians". But this is not the current question. The current question is - is there credible proof for Norse population on the island of Ösel in the viking era? If not, the color of Ösel should be changed on the map. [[User:Blomsterhagens|Blomsterhagens]] ([[User talk:Blomsterhagens|talk]]) 17:01, 1 October 2018 (UTC)}}

Having setup articles for all of the [[Water Resource Region]]s, I think it makes sense to create a Category tree for North America using the USGS [[Hydrological_code#United_StatesHydrological Unit Codes]]. The USGS HUCs include small portions of Canada and Mexico, but eventually the goal would be for a category tree that fully includes Mexico and Canada using the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]]'s (CEC) water basin boundaries that span all three countries. An example of my proposed initial structure is as follows
*[[:Category:Bodies of water of North America]]
**[[:Category:Water resource regions]]
***[[:Category:Missouri water resource region]] - Region level HUC 10). Note that some standalone US Regions are subsumed below the Mississippi in the CEC classification scheme
****[[:Category:Gasconade–Osage water resource subregion]] - Subregion level HUC 1029)
*****[[:Category:Osage basin]] - Basin level HUC 102901
******[[:Category:Sac subbasin]] - Subbasin level HUC 10290106
In theory, while the latest USGS update may have some slightly HUC mappings, I haven't been able to easily find descriptive titles or listing of HUCs for that data. Also, I wasn't planning on setting up categories below the subbasin level, both because I haven't ever found descriptive names at this level, although it is certainly possible they exist. My overall approach would be to start creating a few of the region level categories and add a couple bodies of water to each one. I'd be interested in people's thoughts on this topic.

The section titled 'H-1B and path to permanent residency' seems to have an anti-immigration bias in my opinion.

I don't believe the claims of the IT sector using it for cheap labor are true.  Also terms like "gaming the system" illustrate this isn't content with strong fact behind it. This section should be balanced with how H1B visas are used properly in the educated professional space as a path to perm status. --[[User:MassNerd|MassNerd]] ([[User talk:MassNerd|talk]]) 21:28, 2 October 2018 (UTC)}}

'''Background:''' The [[Talk:Stanley_Kubrick/Archive_9#RfC:_Should_an_infobox_be_added_to_this_page?|most recent infobox RfC]] on this talk page concluded with 70% support for some kind of infobox, but with 17% in favour of ''only'' a default-collapsed infobox, it was ultimately closed as '''no consensus'''. The closer suggested a future RfC on the inclusion of a collapsible infobox as a possible next step. This option has recently been brought up again by {{u|Willydrach}} in the section above where it was decided that an RfC was the next step. Let's try and have a civil RfC on this so we can establish the consensus on whether a collapsible infobox can serve as a compromise.

'''Question:''' Should a collapsible infobox be added to this page?

After a long and broad discussion about schools' notability criteria in this talk page, a formal [[WP:RFC|Request for Comments]] is hereby initiated. Participants are asked about the criteria to be used in deciding if a [[school]] merits a Wikipedia article. (Please note that the criteria would be equally applied for schools in every region and country.) Interested editors are invited to consult [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability_(organizations_and_companies)#Schools_in,_forever|the afore-mentioned discussion]] and [[WP:SCHOOLOUTCOMES]]. The options are as follows:
#'''Schools are inherently notable''' when they exist, their existence [[WP:V|verified]] on the basis of [[WP:RS|reliable and not primary sources]]. 
#'''Schools follow the standard rules for notability of article subjects''', on the same basis.

'''Comment by the nominator'''

*The RfC aims to remove the vagueness of the current state of affairs. Notability of schools is not assessed uniformly and with constant criteria across countries or even within the same country. Some articles remain while others do not, without  significant differences in their notability. The disparity of editors' viewpoint on criteria is wide (see discussion). The community should decide which is the preferable way forward. If either option is chosen we shall have a clear guideline. A few editors welcome fog in Wikipedia's rules (again, see discussion) and this RfC is an opportunity to address tangentially that issue as well, i.e. a no-consensus outcome would essentially retain the vagueness. If, on the other hand, there are editors who believe the situation is already quite clear, all they have to do is denote that situation in their suggestion. Take care, all. -[[User:The Gnome|The Gnome]] ([[User talk:The Gnome|talk]]) 07:48, 11 October 2018 (UTC)}}

Even the [[Rolling Stone]] publication has admitted to the facts of the nature of their relationship. The biggest reason she has NOT been included, according to the discussion above, is because of the back-and-forth edit warring that went on regarding HOW to include her. I believe that the difficulties in reaching an agreement on how to include her in the article do not justify leaving her out altogether.

For the reasons above, I have created this request for comments to answer the following question: **Should Lori Maddox be mentioned in the article?** (We can leave the "how" to a later discussion IF the consensus here is "yes." For now, I just want to see if there is a consensus that she SHOULD be included). Obviously my vote is "yes." <small>RfC relisted by [[User:Cunard|Cunard]] ([[User talk:Cunard|talk]]) at 00:12, 7 October 2018 (UTC)}}

So I wanted to start a discussion about converting this template to use {{tl|infobox}} as a base. As I see it, there are a few options:
# Convert this to use {{tl|infobox}} as a base, which will change the look of the box but unify it to the style of 99% of the infoboxes
# Create a custom Module that will exactly replicate the look of the current box.

Do you think that the DH Lawrence Wikipedia page and the ‘Philosophy and Politics’ section in particular should include differing perspectives on whether Lawrence held authoritarian, even ‘proto-fascist’, views throughout his adult life? More particularly, do you think that the views of Bertrand Russell and Terry Eagleton should be counter-balanced by the inclusion of the views of prominent biographers of Lawrence, John Worthen and Brenda Maddox, who quote letters written later in life by Lawrence, and by the inclusion of a quote from Lawrence’s own essay ‘Democracy’?

'''Background:''' There are a few terms that may be derogatory to some but are generally acceptable in talk page/edit summary usage; amongst these, one such term is "fuck off". Past discussions on whether repetitively using the term "fuck off" at other editors is sanctionable have been inconclusive, with a broad leaning towards this being non-sanctionable.

Over the past recent years, Wikipedia's reach and editor base has grown significantly beyond the West, reaching highly populated English speaking countries like India, which may or may not subscribe to the cultural ethos of language usage subscribed to by Western editors. With the premise that Wikipedia should be inclusive for all global communities involved in editing, I wish to re-assess current community consensus on the talk page usage of the term "fuck off" targeted at other editors.

I am okay if the community still considers this term non-sanctionable, or sanctionable, or even if there is inconclusive consensus – but a benchmark here would allow clarity on how to assess responses at various desks when editors complain at being told to "fuck off".

Therefore, I request the community to comment on the following specific query:

*'''Should the <u>"repetitive usage"</u> of the term <u>"fuck off"</u> by an editor targeted at other editors be considered "sanctionable"?<sup>***</sup>'''
:<small>*** "Sanctionable" refers to the broad universe of escalating warnings, which may lead to blocks, bans, restrictions etcetera if the editor ignores these warnings.</small>

Recently, [[Wikipedia:Today's featured article|TFA]]s have been the target for severe vandalism, and the enormous majority of them end up being semi-protected at the end of the day. More particularly, they have been the target for an IP-hopper who adds obscene images at 550px on the top of the TFA, with some of his vandalism staying for several minutes even being removed by IP readers. I myself have loaded a TFA once with a vagina image on it, and I suppose I'm not the only reader to have done so. I have received the opinion of several editors that we should semi-protect TFAs automatically, but I have also seem valid objections that TFAs are supposed to illustrate the principle of Wikipedia, and indeed, there are occasional constructive edit from IPs on TFAs. I therefore propose that we pending-changes protect TFAs automatically (via {{U|TFA Protector Bot}}) so that we will still be able to have constructive edits from time to time, but high-resolution obscene images will not be publicly viewable. With PCP, TFAs will still be part of the encyclopedia anyone can edit, but although typos might stay for a couple minutes more, they will be free from vandalism. <span style="text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml">[[User:L293D|<b style="color:#060">L293D</b>]]&nbsp;([[User talk:L293D#top|<b style="color:#000">☎</b>]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/L293D|<b style="color:#000">✎</b>]])</span> 23:46, 13 October 2018 (UTC)}}

What details should be included in Vietnam War infobox casualties section? There are several edits I noticed which has deleted info on wounded or equipment losses within the infobox. There is also a secondary question on disclaiming which sources give which figures. There are a series of edits altering "US Bodycount Claims" or "US Sources" to "US Bodycount" that links to another page explaining issues around the figure. E.g. on this article here [[Battle of Minh Thanh Road]]. My assumption was indicating which countries give which sources and where the source as derived from as the standard, e.g. as outlined in the infobox here [[Operation Barbarossa]].[[User:Piccadillysquare|Piccadillysquare]] ([[User talk:Piccadillysquare|talk]]) 04:26, 29 October 2018 (UTC)}}

I am starting to doubt the notability of this TV series for a few reasons.

First of all, the author isn't even notable enough to warrant her own article. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Susan_Meddaugh&type=revision&diff=525453646&oldid=479486341 this diff]. I don't even think the book is notable because it only has one source. I am requesting a deletion discussion at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Martha Speaks (book)]].

Second of all, even one [[Talk:Helen Lorraine|one Wikipedia editor referred to Martha Speaks as "not even meet[ing] notability guidelines"]].

Third, it relies heavily on first-party (primary) sources for its essential (important) information. There are only three second-party sources - two of them are dead links, the third was published 10 years ago. Thus, the editor above could be right about the TV show failing [[WP:GNG]]. As an ordinary children's show, it probably would never get worldwide significance and recognition. Exponentially far more TV shows have worldwide recognition than do — and the difference between a show that gets an article and a show that doesn't is not a matter of "any show gets to have one as soon as an editor actually takes the time to make one", but of "shows only get one if their characters actually receive real-world coverage and analysis of their significance". Unfortunately, Martha Speaks failed the test, big time. 

The [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Martha_Speaks_characters|characters list]] was redirected in a deletion discussion a few weeks ago. Additionally, the characters's individual articles have been redirected for lack of notability:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Helen%20Lorraine&action=history][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martha%20(Martha%20Speaks)&action=history][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariella%20Lorraine&action=history][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alice%20Boxwood&action=history][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Draft:Daniel_Lorraine]

Even think about it, think about more notable shows like [[VeggieTales]] and [[Danny Phantom]]. Those shows warrant articles and character lists because of their massive notability. If you even asked me, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Danny_Phantom_(character) Daniel Fenton], [https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=ceB&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&channel=rcs&biw=1680&bih=865&tbs=ar%3A1&tbm=nws&q=%22Bob+the+Tomato%22+%22Larry+the+Cucumber%22&oq=%22Bob+the+Tomato%22+%22Larry+the+Cucumber%22&gs_l=serp.3...5465.11062.0.11271.5.5.0.0.0.0.250.789.1j3j1.5.0...0.0...1c.1.5.serp.5qhvVeOS78Y Bob the Tomato, and Larry the Cucumber] themselves would be notable to warrant their own articles. But as seen in the much above more discussions, Helen Lorraine, her Daniel Fenton-inspired father, and Mariella clearly aren't even notable to warrant any. [[Arthur (TV series)]] is much more notable and has its titular protagonist warrant an article. Just because Martha Speaks is affiliated with a notable TV show doesn't mean it is just as notable.

A search of [https://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=martha+speaks&acc=off&wc=on&fc=off&group=none Martha Speaks on JSTOR provides 0 sufficient results]. The show is mentioned in some RS but they aren't independent of the topic in question. [https://www.google.co.nz/search?biw=1600&bih=789&tbm=nws&ei=59jnW4uMNNL39QOq-7XIAw&q=martha+speaks&oq=martha+speaks&gs_l=psy-ab.3...60.214.0.379.3.3.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..3.0.0....0.RrRCtInrAxU Zero results on Google News also].

Here are some reasons why I can argue that Martha Speaks is not notable. Being an average and now cancelled TV show, it would take a long time for it to reach notability standards, unlike VT, DP, and Arthur.

===Proposal'''

The current guidelines here:

:At the WikiProject UK geography, we believe the counties of the United Kingdom are important subjects. In order to facilitate the development of these subdivisions of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the following guidelines have been put together.
:In the United Kingdom, the meaning of "county" can be confusing. There are several types of official administrative area that are described as counties due to historical modifications of the borders, and because the extent of the "administrative county boundaries" are often not exactly the same as the ceremonial and ancient county boundaries by of the same name; the counties of England and Waleshave undergone vast geographic transformation in the last few centuries; the counties of Scotland were officially abolished but their territory (in some cases) exist with a ceremonial role; likewise the counties of Northern Ireland have no administrative role, but are used for geographic demarcation and lieutenancy.
:In respect of England, Scotland and Wales, a fundamental part of this guide is to reaffirm the long established position that we do not take the view that the historic/ancient/traditional counties still exist with the former boundaries. Unless (using consensus) a good reason is made not to, the article should describe any administrative and ceremonial changes differences within one article, including any difference in the statistics between them. In England and Wales, where the historic county boundaries are different to modern boundaries the article should discuss these differences, and not be split into new "Historic county of Exampleshire" articles.
:Where counties have been abolished or no longer serve any municipal role (such as Cumberland or Ross-shire) these should have their own articles, but maintain that they no longer function as contemporary counties/subdivisions of territory.

Should be replaced with this:

:In the United Kingdom, the meaning of "county" can be confusing. There are several types of demarcation areas, fulfilling different roles, that are described as counties. They often use the same or similar names and cover similar geographical areas. The main demarcation types are the traditional counties, that have developed over centuries and different administrative areas, such as the ceremonial counties, that have been created by various legislation from the late 19th century onwards. A common misconception is that the legislation that created the administrative areas has also abolished the traditional counties. There is no evidence to support this claim.
:Unless (using consensus) a very good reason is made not to, the article with the name of a traditional county should be about that traditional county. Any administrative area, ceremonial county or other demarcation area with the same or similar name as a traditional county, should be described briefly within the traditional county article but have an article of its own dealing specifically and in greater detail with that other type of county or administrative area. For example, the article entitled ‘Essex’ will be about the traditional county. Reference to its governance will be made in the article, including the area currently administered by London boroughs within Greater London, such as Romford, and areas such as Southend that are administered by unitary authorities. More detail about local government in Romford, since 1965 when the London borough of Havering was created, will be dealt with in the ‘Havering’ article.

In practice very little will change except removing the contradictions caused by the non-referenced and incorrect assertion that the traditional counties have been abolished or altered. Currently, there are different articles dealing with the different areas anyway, so no new ones will be created and to claim otherwise, as some of us are doing, or to claim excessive doubling-up, is misleading. All that will happen is that the counties/areas different roles will be more clearly and more accurately defined, which is what wikipedia is here to do. Therefore, this proposal will actually simplify and clarify matters, having the opposite effect to what the neigh-sayers claim it will have.

(References to back both sides and to give relevant weight will follow. Any help in this regard would be welcome, but please avoid using any ambiguous citations that do not define what county is referred to, or citations that reference back to or feed off each other.)

*** [[Asiatic lion]]
** ''[[Panthera leo melanochaita]]'' -  a stubby article that is in effect a disambiguation page to:
*** [[Cape lion]]
*** [[East African lion]]
*** [[Southern African lion]]

* [[Northern lion]] - synonymous with ''[[Panthera leo leo]]'' (???)

*[[History of lions in Europe]]
** [[American lion]]
** [[Sri Lanka lion]]
** [[Gaetulian lion]]

The issue isn't one of Creation Science but one of [[WP:NPOV|neutrality]], where the language in the article that declares that:
:"Abiogenesis or origin of life <u>is the natural process by which life arises from non-living matter</u> 
is not NPOV because it asserts a thesis that life comes about through an "[[up from the muck]]" process only, which is vastly overreaching and overstated, and categorically rules out "[[down from the stars]]" theories. Rowan claims science is agnostic, then the POV here is that science and the article should remain agnostic and not atheistic.

:''Was'' "Science as a compendium of revelations from God "
There is an idea of science as being exclusively a revelation from nature, but the idea of science as being the revelations of God has some history in philosophy, and in the religionist's accommodating usage of "philosophy" and "science" (note similarity in meaning) as fitting in a Holy perspective. For example, claims and references to claims like "[in] the prolegomena to Aristotle’s Physica, [Girolamo] [[Girolamo Zanchi|Zanchi]] makes the case that philosophy ultimately comes to man by divine revelation"[https://calvinistinternational.com/2017/02/10/zanchis-aristotle-4-philosophy-as-revelation/]. 

Some might read that as philsophy and not science, but the connection between science and philosophy is deep, and of late is perhaps misconveyed as distant, such that philosophy connotes soft and unrigourous research which includes the possibility of God, while "science" has become a code word for 'atheistic research only.' I suggested at [[WP:VP/I#Articles which ask a question|WP:VP/I]] that we have articles which ask questions, but first perhaps a single article on the "[[Big questions]]" is required. One of the big questions we know by heart and mind is "[[is there a God?]]" From that basis, treatment of God as a possibility can be asked as a question, and then the treatment of God as an object for scientific proof. Dear science, can there be <s>some connection between science and philosophy and religion?</s> -[[User:Inowen|Inowen]] ([[User talk:Inowen|nlfte]]) 04:16, 11 November 2018 (UTC)}}

After what is turning out to be an unsuccessful proposal at [[Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion#Proposal/RfC - Extend WP:U5 to the draftspace]], I have come up with something new. I reckon that we should allow proposed deletions in the draftspace. This will ensure that things like [[WP:NOTESSAY]], [[WP:NOTWEBHOST]] and [[WP:NOTHOWTO]] trash can be PRODed instead of having to go into [[WP:MfD]]. Also, [[WP:PROD]] has a seven-day wait most of the time before the page is deleted so it can mean that things can be deleted after seven days with proposed deletions in the draftspace without having to go to [[WP:MfD]] for basic things like [[WP:NOTESSAY]], [[WP:NOTWEBHOST]] and [[WP:NOTHOWTO]] which have no chance and obviously will get deleted.

''' Web content by non-staff contributors '''

{{Shortcut|WP:CONTRIBUTOR|WP:CONTRIBUTORS}}
On [[Online newspaper|news websites]], [[periodical]] websites (excluding [[academic journals]]), and [[blog]]s, [[web content]] authored by non-staff [[Freelancer|contributors]] is questionable if the contributors are subject to reduced editorial oversight, even if the web content is published in a source that is otherwise reliable. Compared to [[staff writer]]s, contributors generally have a lesser reputation for fact-checking and error correction. Reliable publications distinguish articles written by staff writers from ones written by contributors by indicating the author's job title in the [[byline]]. Less reputable sources only display the author's job title on their profile page or the website's [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]].

Examples of sources that publish content from non-staff contributors include [[WP:RSP#Forbes.com contributors|Forbes.com]] and ''[[WP:RSP#HuffPost contributors|HuffPost]]''.

[[Opinion piece]]s in reliable sources have their [[#Statements of opinion|own guideline]], which applies instead of this one.

== Not biased. '''

Part of the article contains critiques on Moro, but article itself is not biased as it contains no subjective matter, only well-sourced facts. For balancing, needs more content on so-called achievements instead of deleting sourced content. Critiques on article, on the other hand, are biased as they state sources aren't reliable when they're established media outlets serving as source for numerous articles in Wikipedia. We can't start judjing sources as unreliable based only on their political leanings.  

:ConJur is a [[WP:PARTISAN]] source. CartaCapital links are dead and together with CartaCampinas both are declared left-wing publication that doesn't meet [[WP:RS]] and [[WP:V]]. Rede Brasil Atual is a [[WP:QUESTIONABLE]] editoral.

:The controversy section ignores Moro's highly popular and praised merits and only focuses on leftist rhetoric. The Portuguese article don't even have those criticism.
::Sources present are major jornalistic ones, such as [[Folha de São Paulo]] and [[Universo Online]]. All other sources are also well accepted and are currently in use in other articles. And in the article in portuguese Wiki, actually, the "criticism section" is [[:pt:Sérgio Moro#Críticas|twice as big]]. So, this is neither here nor there.

Should [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s pronunciation of his own name ("Lyov" per Lectures on Russian Literature by [[Vladimir Nabokov]]) be included in the article in the lead or as a footnote? It's a very uncommon transliteration of the Russian name Lev, especially in connection to Tolstoy who has been widely known by the names Lev and Leo in Russia and worldwide, with few sources referring to him as "Lyov" as I showed on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Leo_Tolstoy#The_article_should_include_the_sourced_statement_that_Tolstoy_pronounced_his_first_name_as_%E2%80%98Lyov%E2%80%99 talk page].

{{rfcquote|text=
There has been debate recently about which administrators should be included on school and school district articles. While [[WP:WPSCH/AG#WNTI]] indicates we should not be including anything other than the principal/head teacher, that is an essay as {{ping|Alansohn}} has noted. There was a discussion on this talk page on this subject above, but the respondents would have been only those interested in this project. I am therefore seeking wider input via this RfC. 

'''Question:''' Should school and school district articles include any administrators other than principal/head teacher/headmaster/superintendent even if we have one or more sources to support administrators below the top administrator?

'''Examples:''' '''(1)''' With only the principal; [[Dublin High School (California)]] and '''(2)''' With others below the principal; [[Bayonne High School]] (infobox and [[Bayonne_High_School#Administration]])

{{rfcquote|text=
There has been much debate about [[:File:Nelumbo Nucifera fruit - botanic garden Adelaide.jpg|this image]] (of a lotus seed pod) at the [[Trypophobia]] article. So far, the debate has produced [[Talk:Trypophobia/Archive 1#discussion|a 2013 RfC]], [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 122#Images on phobia articles|a 2015 Village pump (policy) discussion]], a [[Talk:Trypophobia/Archive 2#RfC Should we include this image?|2015 RfC here at this talk page]], and now this one. The first RfC closed as no consensus to remove the image, the second discussion did not have an official close, but more editors leaned toward excluding the image (and other phobia images in phobia articles), and the final RfC closed as consensus for including the image. The discussions have concerned whether or not including the image is beneficial to readers, and whether or not it causes unnecessary harm to our readers. One view has been that the image is educational because demonstrating what induces trypophobia is not easy since a simple explanation of "a fear of holes" or "irregular patterns or clusters of small holes, or bumps" does not suffice. People with trypophobia can look at holes or irregular patterns and not have a reaction. Rather, the condition is about certain patterns, and in particular images that present high-contrast energy at low and midrange spatial frequencies. Lotus seed pod imagery is commonly noted as imagery that induces trypophobia and is used by researchers to test for trypophobia. Another view is that the image is irrelevant, decorative, or not needed, and that, even if it is educational, it causes unnecessary harm to our readers; this is seen, for example, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trypophobia&diff=825431354&oldid=825177525 here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trypophobia&diff=853832257&oldid=851901689 here]. [[WP:NOTCENSORED]] has been cited in past discussions. Some have felt that removing the image based on the possibility that it might harm readers, especially if the condition is not real or an actual phobia, is censoring. Others have stated that this is not a matter of WP:NOTCENSORED; it's a matter of whether we really need the image for the topic and whether we want to risk causing our readers harm. The imagery won't harm those without trypophobia, but it will harm those with it (they are the ones most likely to visit this article) and, with more research on the topic having been done since past discussions, researchers are are clear that it exists and does induce negative psychological or autonomic nervous system responses. 

As a compromise, editors have suggested collapsing the image (although collapsing it has been noted as something that would cause accessibility issues), or moving the image far down the page. '''So should we remove the image? Retain the image in the lead, but collapse it? Or move it lower?'''

Should this page be renamed from "Tattoo medical issues" to "'''Medical issues of tattooing'''" or "'''Health effects of tattoos'''"?

The name as it stands seems to be "off" to me. It's hard to explain, but I guess I would say it violates wiki convention and doesn't make much grammatical/style sense. In one aspect, it's ''quick and to the point'' but in another it seems somehow ''undignified'' and ''simplistic''. I would also say that the current title is not exactly NPOV, given that no substantial health effects have ever been discovered from sterile and safe tattooing practices in modern tattoo parlors. (This is also a problem the article itself has as a whole, with focus on esoteric and rare complications as if they are common. I'm interested in revamping the article to reflect that, and will be doing so over the next few weeks.) Perhaps "Health effects of tattoos" would be more neutral and aesthetically pleasing. But what does everyone else think? Please add your votes and discussion below in bold like so:

Although a request for citation has been present since May 2017, there have been no citations added to support the claims that Mr James Karat "invented" STP. STP is a well known concept and not an invention created by a single person. It is simply the automation of business processes. There is no mention of what role Mr Karat played in the automation of the process - it appears he was working on an automation project anyway, so is it actually the case that he was the "jobber" and not a business process architect, system architect, system developer or any person who could have claim to "inventing" a concept. It appears that the entries have been made by Mr Karat himself and not someone independent. In fact in April 2016 the Edit History shows [[user:Graemeaustin|Graeme Austin]] commenting "Origination of phrase is in fact in dispute. James Karat may have been the first but I was deeply involved in STP in the early 90s in London and he is not known to me."

Should references to Mr Karat be removed?

Has the author violated WP protocols?
I have been accused of violating WP protocols in this and other articles.  I replaced an accurate article, violating WP: NPOV, NOR, SYN:NOR, UNDUE, OWN.  I welcome the opportunity to show why these charges are mistaken.  All of the elements of my case appear in the “Instrumentalism” lede, which now replaces my article in order to restore the status quo anti which I replaced in 2014.

The present lede defines instrumentalism as an “interpretation” or “theory” that “scientific theory is merely a tool” of prediction that says nothing about unobservable reality.  It claims this proposition was introduced by Duhem in 1906, and is the prevailing theory-of-theory in physics today.  It then states that instrumentalism is a form of anti-realism—the “demise” of which is claimed in the historical discussion that follows.  Thus INSTRUMENTALISM IS BOTH ALIVE AND DEAD—a paradox stated as a fact.  This characterization of instrumentalism in the original and present article is inaccurate, which explains my decision to replace.[[User:TBR-qed|TBR-qed]] ([[User talk:TBR-qed|talk]]) 14:42, 31 October 2018 (UTC)}}

Should we make this template hidden in the article mainspace with a code to those who doesn't logged in, especially readers?

The effect of removing the links mentioned above while allowing the links given below to remain, was that only a single point of view was allowed to express as a commentary on the political party while the opposing point of views were not allowed to be present.

Wikipedia policy on neutral point of view clearly states that if an opnion is stated in a news then it must be clarified in the encyclopedia entry that it is opinion of someone and not a fact

"Usually, articles will contain information about the significant opinions that have been expressed about their subjects. However, these opinions should not be stated in Wikipedia's voice"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view

The citations given are from websites with questionable integrity like infomoney.br, of whose charter and aims we know nothing about. Also the citations do not explain at all why the labelling of "far-right" has been done, it just uses it casually.

It is highly improper to use newspaper articles in this manner. News can be used as citation to say "event x occurred", but not as a conclusive evidence to say "x is a bad person" or "x is a far right" or "x is a far left". I disagree with this kind of biased approach and I request for comments.

I am going to propose that [[WP:U5]] gets extended to the draftspace. This is because the draftspace is being abused in a way that there are so many drafts being found daily which are basically [[WP:NOTWEBHOST]]. It is mainly point 5 of [[WP:NOTWEBHOST]] which I am seeing in loads of drafts. Rule 5 of [[WP:NOTWEBHOST]] is "Content for projects unrelated to Wikipedia. Do not store material unrelated to Wikipedia, including in userspace." and I am seeing that new users are using the draftspace in a way so that [[WP:U5]] can be escaped because [[WP:U5]] does not apply to the draftspace at the moment. If this is implemented, there will be less drafts coming to [[WP:MfD]] daily that could actually do with being speedily deleted per [[WP:U5]]. 

My new proposed wording for [[WP:U5]] is:

Pages in userspace or draftspace consisting of [[WP:NOTWEBHOST|writings, information, discussions, and/or activities not closely related to Wikipedia's goals]], where the owner has made few or no edits outside of [[Wikipedia:User pages|user pages]] and [[Wikipedia:Drafts|drafts]], with the exception of plausible drafts and pages adhering to [[Wikipedia:User pages#What may I have in my user pages?]].

I'm not proposing to do this all at once, but to work on it step-by-step so that objections to one aspect don't derail the whole thing.

One aspect of G6 stands out as being a particularly poor fit with the rest: "Deleting redirects in the "File:" namespace with the same name as a file or redirect at Commons, provided the redirect on Wikipedia has no file links (unless the links are obviously intended for the file or redirect at Commons)." Accordingly I propose to move this criterion, without any changes, from G6 to a new R4 for these reasons:
*It deals only with redirects, and is thus where someone will look for it
*The general footer to the R criteria (don't speedy delete redirects with significant history, use RfD for redirects that don't meet the criteria) apply to these redirects equally with others
*It contains requirements that are significantly different to other things deleted using G6
*This isn't really "maintenance" in the same sense as other aspects of G6 (e.g. pages created in error/in the wrong place, etc)
*Deletion summaries will become more useful.
This does not change what can be speedy deleted, just under which criterion is gets speedy deleted. [[User:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] ([[User talk:Thryduulf|talk]]) 12:43, 5 November 2018 (UTC)}}

Background: There are no official reporting agencies for budget or gross figures in Indian cinema. News outlets must rely on their proprietary methods for estimating these values, and sometimes outlets' values conflict.

Some reliable sources, including Times of India[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/rajinikanth-and-akshay-kumars-2-0-times-when-the-film-made-headlines/rs-543-crore-spent-on-vfx-of-the-akshay-kumar-and-rajinikanth-starrer-2-0/photostory/65770317.cms] have estimated this film's budget at {{INR|link=yes}}543 [[crore]] ({{INR|link=yes}}5.43 billion). Another source generally considered reliable, Bollywood Hungama, has cast doubts on the high figures being reported, presenting a budget estimate of {{INR|link=yes}}400 crore ({{INR|link=yes}}4 billion).[https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/bollywood/revealed-real-budget-rajinikanth-akshay-kumar-starrer-2-0/]

Hi all, I noticed Siri Knowledge incorrectly listed TC as a Republican, went to edit on Wikipedia (where I think Siri Knowledge is sourced from) and actually no party was listed at all. Another user who seems to have an axe to grind is deleting this factual information because TC doesn't meet their standards of what they personally think a Democrat is. Not sure how to proceed with this, as when I have reverted unwarranted deletions like this in the past, I usually end up with warnings for 'edit warring' and whatnot. Could anyone advise as to how to proceed so that factual information can be reflected in this article? 

Just to clarify, TC is a Democrat. A user is arguing that it's 'extremely disingenuous'/'misleading' to then state in his bio that he is Democrat. I'm not sure I understand the argument - it seems counter-rational. But maybe someone can enlighten. [[User:Proustfala|Proustfala]] ([[User talk:Proustfala|talk]]) 18:34, 6 December 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I'm inviting you to participate in the resolution of one of the most long term discussions on Wikipedia. 

Normally, an RfC wouldn't be needed for such a simple edit, but for anyone who's familiar with this article, it's known how hard this topic is. The lack of sources led to more than a decade of pointless discussions. 

The purpose of this RfC is not to change the current consensus or the article text, but to put a further context to the current consensus. After several years since the current consensus was established, readers were constantly confused by the article text, which led to numerous change requests. Since then, one editor made a good research and found a source which settles the whole debate. 

This source gives the exact definition of Tesla's birthplace. It is backed up by a primary source, thus making it the most strongest source on the matter.

The source gives this definition of Tesla's birthplace:

"After many pleas from Jelecic, in 1850 the King's proclamation, which was signed by all 8 Austrian ministers, was finally announced...For Military Frontier, the King decided that it will remain within its present territory. However, it will with, Croatia and Slavonia, constitute a single land with disaggregated provincial and military administration, and representation." , page 157. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/najnovijedobahrv00horv|title=Najnovije doba hrvatske povjesti|first=Rudolf|last=Horvat|date=8 December 2018|publisher=U Zagrebu Matica hrvatska|accessdate=8 December 2018|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

There are two parts of this RfC. 

1.Rfc suggestion.
The purposed change is to add the mentioned source as a reference to this sentence:
Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village Smiljan, Lika county, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia), on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856.[12][13]
{{reflist-talk}}

2.RfC question

Was Nikola Tesla born in a single Austrian land composed of Military Frontier, Croatia and Slavonia per provided source.

I'm a bit irritated by the inconsistency in how Northern Irish people are categorized on Wikipedia. Looking at [[:Category:DJs by nationality]], all of the DJs by nationality are categorized by the adjective form (e.g. "American DJs", "Russian DJs", "British DJs", even "[[:Category:Welsh DJs|Welsh DJs]]" and "[[:Category:Scottish DJs|Scottish DJs]]") '''but not Northern Irish DJs''' who are categorized as "[[:Category:DJs from Northern Ireland|DJs from Northern Ireland‎]]". I don't like this at all! I once started a CfD to change the DJs category but it was opposed on the basis that all the other Northern Irish people categories use the "xxx from Northern Ireland" form. So I'm proposing to change it on a wider scale, changing all category instances of "xxx from Northern Ireland" to "Northern Irish xxx" for consistency with the other similar categories of different countries. <u style="font:1.1em/1em Arial Black">[[User:Flooded with them hundreds|<u style="color:#7f2ed1">Flooded </u>]]<u style="color:#bfa6d8"><small>with them </small></u>[[User_talk:Flooded with them hundreds|<u style="color:#7f2ed1">'''hundreds'''</u>]]</u> 13:47, 13 November 2018 (UTC)}}

As this discussion is rapidly spinning out of control (witness multiple sections being opened on the same topic and attempts to centralize the discussion being reverted), it appears a more formal (and widely publicized) solution is in order.

The question is: 

'''What if anything should we include at this time on the "Nazi salute controversy"?'''

It's also fairly clear we have four choices:
#Some variation (subject to discussion on the finer points) of what existed [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baraboo_High_School&diff=prev&oldid=868681256 here].
#Nothing.
#Nothing for now, revisiting in say three months so we can accurately gauge the enduring nature of this information.
#A brief discussion of the school itself's role in this.

Please indicate your preferences in order from the one that most suits your position to the least suitable, along with your arguments.

 Should tone marks be used in Wade-Giles transliterations? Is it ''Wei<sup>1</sup> Chai<sup>2</sup> Shih<sup>4</sup> P&#x2bb;in<sup>1</sup>-yin<sup>1</sup>'' or ''Wei Chai Shih Pʻin-yin''?

'''TLDR''': You’d be hard pressed to find anyone other than Wikipedia who transliterates Chinese with Wade-Giles tone marks. I searched for ''Mao² Tsê²-tung¹'' on Gbooks and went away empty handed.

Until the early 1980s, Wade-Giles was that standard way to transliterate Chinese characters. It was popularized by ''[http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CADAL/B33646119/ A Chinese-English Dictionary]''  (1912) by [[Herbert Giles]]. The entry titles in Giles’ dictionary are all-caps and without tone marks: “HUANG.” The idea that the system includes tones marks does not come from the dictionary itself, but rather from usage by Giles in the preface and supplementary tables of his dictionary.

The name "Wade-Giles system" is intended to suggest "Wade's system as implemented in Giles dictionary." But in fact the system is usually understood to encompass implementations by ''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary|Mathew's Dictionary]]'' (1943) and others. It is not the property of Herbert Giles. ''[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Wade-Giles-romanization#accordion-article-history Encyclopedia Britannica]''`s article on the system includes an extensive list of examples, none of them with tone marks. The multivolume reference work ''[[Cambridge History of China]]'' is one of the few places where the contemporary reader might encounter Wade-Giles in the wild, so to speak. The CHC implementation does not include tone marks. [[User:FineStructure137|FineStructure137]] ([[User talk:FineStructure137|talk]]) 14:01, 14 November 2018 (UTC)}}

I have [[WP:BOLD|boldly]] added automatic substitution category for the AfC Invitation template, as substitution is already happening through the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Articles_for_creation/Helper_script|AfC Helper Script]]. However, for the normal invitation, this is not happening (in at least the Teahouse Helper Script). Because the transclusion count is [https://tools.wmflabs.org/templatecount/index.php?lang=en&namespace=4&name=Teahouse%2FInvitation#bottom ~50,000], {{u|AnomieBOT}} won't substitute this template until it is added to the [[User:AnomieBOT/TemplateSubster force|force page]]. A consensus is needed for this. Please indicate your '''support''' or '''oppose'''.

Yeah, I know, [[WP:PERENNIAL]]. But after yet another compromised inactive admin account ran amok over the project today, I feel like this should be revisited. The account in question did not have a logged action in over 2 years, and had made only 5 edits in 2017 and one in 2018. The policy [[Special:Permalink/866740594#Procedural removal for inactive administrators|as currently worded]] reads:

{{quotebox|Administrators who have made neither edits nor administrative actions for at least 12 months may be desysopped.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/suspend sysop rights of inactive admins]], June 2011</ref> Subject to the [[#Lengthy inactivity|lengthy inactivity]] consideration below, this desysopping is not to be considered permanent, or a reflection on the user's use of, or rights to, the admin tools. The admin must be contacted on their user talk page and via e-mail (if possible) one month before the request for desysopping and again several days before the desysopping goes into effect. Desysopping on inactivity grounds should be handled by English Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|bureaucrats]]. The summary in the user rights log should make it clear that the desysopping is purely procedural.}}

I propose modifying this to:

{{quotebox|Administrators who have made no logged administrative actions for at least 12 months may be desysopped.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/suspend sysop rights of inactive admins]], June 2011</ref> Subject to the [[#Lengthy inactivity|lengthy inactivity]] consideration below, this desysopping is not to be considered permanent, or a reflection on the user's use of, or rights to, the admin tools. Desysopping on inactivity grounds should be handled by English Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|bureaucrats]]. The summary in the user rights log should make it clear that the desysopping is purely procedural.}}

{{reflist-talk}}

The change removes the notification requirement, and the "edits" criterion. The effect is that admin accounts which don't use admin tools for 12 months will simply have the bit silently removed as a matter of security. We won't tell them we're about to do it, and then they won't log in and make one nonsense edit to hang on to the bit. Removal will just happen when they've been away long enough, and if they come back some time later and want to go back to adminning they just ask at BN and go through the 24-hour hold like anyone else whose bit has been voluntarily removed. In fact admins should be ''actively discouraged'' from "holding on to the bit" in this manner, but let's at least do this.

Why not rename this to "Articles for Discussion", and then fold [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]], all of the {{tl|Merge}} stuff, all of the {{tl|Split}} stuff, and possibly [[WP:DRAFTIFY]] into one AFD process? I'm sure that there are one or two other process that could easily fit under an "articles for discussion" umbrella, as well. De-emphasizing deletion as the primary mechanism, even if it is only a "psychological" de-emphasis, certainly couldn't hurt anything though. Most importantly however, simplifying and centralizing 4-5 different processes into a single discussion forum could only help all of us as editors, I would think.

As a prelude to taking this to formal arbitration a discussion on the talk page is usually required - this is it.

User:Cagwinn has on this page, and a number of others, repeatedly placed his personal opinion above that of the relevant scholarship, usually making some plea that certain relevant and entirely reputable books or papers are inadmissible as they are not written by philologists, even though the linguistic point at dispute has direct historical implications, and common sense would imply that scholarly historical references would be entirely appropriate.

In the case of this article, which contains very few citations, he has removed material which is multiply cited to reputable scholarly material. He does not refute the the existence of the scholarly material used, he does not offer alternative views supported by more compelling scholarly citations, he does not choose to add an opposing viewpoint to stand alongside the existing material. No, what he does is remove existing fully referenced material, citing no scholarly material as support for this, merely his own views on the subject. This is own research in its most overt form, and is blatant point of view peddling. Both being entirely antithetical to the spirit and the rules of editing Wikipedia articles.

Currently, the scope of the move review process is limited to reviewing whether [[WP:RM|requested move]] discussions have been properly closed and executed. The results of discussions that take place as part of the processes called '[[WP:CFD|categories for discussion]]' and '[[WP:RFD|redirects for discussion]]' have in the past been reviewed at [[WP:DRV|deletion review]], even when the relevant discussions did not involve deletion. The awkwardness of this situation has recently become an issue, and so I've opened this RfC. Should the purview of the move review process formally be expanded to include reviews of the closing of renaming discussions that take place at [[WP:CfD]] and [[WP:RfD]], and should the MR, CfD, and RfD pages be updated to clarify the review process for discussions that take part as part of those processes to that effect?

I have been drawn to this question by [[User:יניב הורון|יניב הורון (Yaniv)]].

The history section is currently 39 paragraphs long, and >100kb in size (about 1/3 of the entire article). It is haphazard in the weight it puts against each of the periods of the region's history (a good visual overview is below). Some examples: we have just two paragraphs on the entire first millenium AD (i.e. from 0AD to 1099AD, including just a single sentence on the development of Christianity in the region), just one sentence on the entire Ottoman period, and just two paragraphs on the mandate period.

{{Timeline of Palestine Sovereign Powers}}

So I have two questions for the community:
# How much weight should the history section of this article have? Is 39 paragraphs '''too much''', '''too little''', or '''about right'''?
# What is a fair and objective way for '''deciding the due weight''' for each time period?

I would like to propose that we delete [[:Category:Articles created via the Article Wizard]] because this is useless tracking and it already has over 40,000 pages which don't need to be tracked. ArticleWizard is the process that many new editors use to create new articles or new drafts for articles and it is pointless to track this. Two years ago, [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Categories_for_discussion/2016/08/Category:Uploaded_with_UploadWizard Commons got rid of a similar category that tracked images uploaded with UploadWizard]. It is just useless to track pages created with the ArticleWizard. I recently got rid of [[:Category:Unreviewed new articles created via the Article Wizard]] over two weeks ago and that was useless tracking as well. There was a CfD at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2014 February 4#Category:Articles_created_via_the_Article_Wizard]] over four and half years ago and at that time, AfC wasn't that stabilised but now it is. There are over 40,000 pages which don't need to be tracked with this category and 109 useless monthly subcategories of this category that are being tracked at [[:Category:Userspace drafts created via the Article Wizard]] that don't need to be tracked.

Note that under wikipedia policy self published sources (SPS) and reliable sources (RS) are not mutually exclusive, SPS may be considered reliable if published by an expert in the field being discussed, but regardless of expertise SPS may '''never''' be used as a source for statements about living persons (other than the author of the SPS), see [[WP:BLPSPS]]. 

So the questions are: Is SBM reliable as a source? And are articles on SBM never, sometimes or always self published sources? Note that this RfC is NOT about whether to change any policies, only about when(if ever), under current policy, SBM can be used as a source.

Right now, {{noping|Citation bot}} removes publisher and location in {{tl|cite journal}}. Proponents of this removal state that this is recommended by nearly every style guide under the belief that there is little value to the information.

* Several recent threads at [[User talk:Citation bot]] indicate that removing the parameters is unexpected at-best and believed to be detrimental at worst;
* "nearly every style guide" is not [[WP:MOS|our style guide]]
* Removing them does not respect the consensus in [[Module:Citation/CS1]], which is to provide the parameters in cite journal.

This RFC seeks [[WP:CCC|consensus]] for the following questions:

# Should Citation bot continue to remove these data?

This would affect multiple pages but since Ryan is the current speaker I thought this might be a better place to start. In short: should Paul Ryan be counted as the 54th Speaker or the 62nd? News sources seem to disagree: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/paul-ryan-elected-the-houses-62nd-speaker-1446130384] [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paul-ryan-elected-the-houses-62nd-speaker-2015-10-29][https://www.salon.com/2015/10/29/bye_bye_boehner_paul_ryan_elected_62nd_speaker_of_the_house/][https://mashable.com/2015/10/29/paul-ryan-speaker-house/#lYQs5DQBF8qJ] say 62nd, [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/house-gop-ready-to-make-paul-ryan-speaker] [https://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/ryan-elected-house-speaker-215342] say 54th. Ryan is the 54th ''person'' to be Speaker, but several speakers served two or more non-consecutive terms ([[Frederick Muhlenberg]], [[Henry Clay]], [[John W. Taylor (politician)]], [[Sam Rayburn]] and [[Joseph W. Martin Jr.]]), including the next likely Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, so there have been 62 distinct terms of the Speakership.

In short, should Paul Ryan be counted as the '''54th''' or '''62nd''' Speaker? '''[[User:Nevermore27|<span style="color: #660198">Nevermore27</span>]]''' ([[User talk:Nevermore27|talk]]) 23:39, 13 December 2018 (UTC)}}

From the template documentation:

<code>seats_before1 ... The seat count before the election, labeled 'current seats' if the election is yet to take place.</code>

<code>seat_change1 ... The change in the number of seats won at the election compared to the previous election.</code>

'''Questions:'''
# Does a vacant seat count as a "seat before" for a party? What if it is in a district that is considered safe? What if RSes generally count a vacant seat as a "party's seat"?
# Should "seat change" be calculated from "last election" or "seats before"? 
# Should "the rules" be the same for all articles, or should there be exceptions for certain elections (based on nation, or type, etc.)? One size fits all?

''Example 1:'' Party A has 100 members in "last election." Two retire, leaving 98 "seats before." In the election, the two seats are filled by Party A candidates, leaving 100 "seats after." Is Party A's "seat change" +2 (from "seats before") or 0 (from "last election")?

''Example 2:'' "Last election" is Party A 100, Party B 100. Two As retire, leaving 98 A / 100 B. In a special election to fill one of those vacancies, Party B wins, "flipping the seat," leaving 98 A / 101 B as "seats before." On Election Day, Party A wins 99 seats, Party B wins 101 seats ("seats after"). Is Party A's "seat change" +1 (99 "seats after" - 98 "seats before") or -1 (100 "last election" - 99 "seats after")?

''Example 3:'' "Last election" is 100 A / 100 B. Each party has two vacancies, leaving 98 A / 98 B. One of the A seats is won by a B candidate in a special election, leaving 98 A / 99 B "seats before." On Election Day, one of the B vacancies flips to A, leaving 100 A / 100 B "seats after." Is "seat change" +2 A, +1 B (98->100, 99->100, from "seats before"), meaning both parties made gains in the election, or is "seat change" 0 A, 0 B (100->100 for both from "last election")?

Is it an {{s|"open election" or}} an "open seat" if an incumbent runs in an early round of the election (''e.g.'' a primary), but no incumbent runs in the final round (''e.g.'' a general election)? For example, if an incumbent runs and loses in a primary, or withdraws after a primary, and there is no incumbent in the general election, is that an "open" election or an "open" seat?)
