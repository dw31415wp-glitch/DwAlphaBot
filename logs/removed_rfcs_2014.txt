This is a request for comments regarding the original document by editor, Daniellagreen (Green), 14:43, 9 December 2013, and the edits made by TheRedPenofDoom (Red), 14:53, 9 December 2013.  Green included citations and references to Blogbymichele, a WordPress website blog.  The blog references included in the article support that Greiner had the respect of students.  The citations were included to show that support, and to reflect that undergraduate students - in addition to Law School students - respected him.  Generally, while blogs might be questionable sources, the references cited support the article and the context of the sentences in which they were included (that Greiner was President of UB, and that he had the respect of students, more specifically in this context, undergraduate students).  On researching both of the blog articles, the context in which they were used is, therefore, relevant to the support of the article.  The blog author states that she was an undergraduate UB student, that she is a graduate of UB, and her links to LinkedIn, in her education section, and found on both articles, also reflect that she graduated from UB.  The blog author provides one or more photographs of herself with President Greiner at UB, further supporting the context for the article.  Additionally, she included a primary source document written by Greiner in one of her blog articles that is cited, and she also references the same document in her second blog article that is cited.  Therefore, the blog article that includes the primary source document could be considered a secondary source on the article's topic, [[Bill Greiner]].  Therefore, both blog articles support, give relevance to, and are of appropriate context to be included in the article.  The article was reviewed and accepted for publication in its original form which included both blog articles - they are relevant, support the topic, are not libelous, and include appropriate context.  Therefore, they should remain included in the original article, and not deleted by Red.  Please comment.

Because the previous discussion about a proposed move ended in no consensus, I am starting a new discussion and opening it up to more editors. The original proposal was to move [[:Australia national association football team]] → {{no redirect|Australia men's national association football team}} which resulted in 10 comments in support and 9 in opposition: a pretty even split as the closing admin noted. Those in support generally argue that without "men's" included in the title, the article represents [[WP:BIAS]] and does not reflect [[WP:NPOV]] as there is a [[Australia women's national association football team]] as well. Arguments opposing the proposition generally state that the men's team is more prominent than the women's team and [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]] applies to the current title of the article.

Should the wording be changed from "pubic wig" to "a wig for the pudendum"?

I obviously, as evidenced in the thread above, favor keeping the long-standing wording of "pubic wig" as the main description for the following reasons: that's what our sources say, it is the most common term, and the problematic fact that dictionaries define pudendum as applying "especially to females." Because merkins are used by both men and women, and the word pudendum is almost never applied to males, we should choose to keep the gender neutral expression "pubic wig".

I am not averse to adding mention that the wording "a wig for the pudendum" exists, pending finding RS to that effect, but, for the reasons expressed above (also in the previous thread), believe "pubic wig" should be the more commonly used term in this article. -- [[User:BullRangifer|Brangifer]] ([[User talk:BullRangifer|talk]]) 08:16, 5 December 2013 (UTC)}}

The template allows the link to be formatted as we may do in main articles to display like so [http://www.majestic-theatre.com Majestic theatre], however this is depreciated although it does explain in the template documentation how to do it and it works. Im looking for two things, consensus on whether or not we should display full URL's in info-boxes (whether thats wrapped in an template or not) and if they should be displayed as a full URL should parameter 2 in {{tl|URL}} be removed meaning the template cannot display a formatted link, the latter has been proposed [[Template_talk:URL#Concern_over_parameter_2|here]] anyway.

Recently there have been several discussions at various forums regarding issues with the username policy and the enforcement of that policy. This is intended as a review of any issues relating to both the policy and the way it is enforced. Any user is free to add new sections detailing any issue that concerns them, but are asked to please carefully review all the previous sections first in case there is already a discussion that is germane to the same issue or issues. Please be sure to add a timestamp to any new sections by signing it with ''five'' tildes.  

Issues  are presented in no particular order. Each issue should have its own dedicated discussion section. For discussion of the process itself, please use the talk page.

'''Promotional usernames'''

*''See also: [[WP:ORGNAME]], the policy as currently written. ''
*Traditionally, policy has held that any name that can reasonably be interpreted as representing a specific organization is a violation. However, if a user identifies themselves as an individual acting at the behest of that organization that has generally been seen as permissible. (This is colloquially referred to as the "Mark at Alcoa" exemption.) So, for example "A1 Carpet Company" would be considered a violation while "Bill from A1 Carpet" would not. Should this continue to be the way the policy is understood and enforced?
*Some administrators have argued that having the name of a real organization in your username should only be considered a violation if the user is also acting in a way that attempts to promote that same organization. Is this what the community expects or are all names of real organizations to be treated as violations whether they are acting promotionally or not?
*We often see users promoting organizations that, for all intents and purposes, are not real. For example, using the name of their YouTube account or Online gaming "crews" and posting articles as though these were real organizations in the real world, i.e. "Stickleback studios" or "Badass Corporation". Should these be considered username violations or should the users simply be warned for self-promotion and advised that their "organization" is almost certainly not notable enough for inclusion?
*In cases where there is no doubt that the name is a violation, what should the administrative reaction entail? Options include hard blocking, (which requires the user to file a successful  unblock request in order to return to editing) soft blocking, (which stops the user from using the offending name but allows for them simply creating a new account and trying again) or just informing the user of the issue and asking them to file a request to change their name? Is their behavior a factor in which option to choose, or should all obvious violations be treated the same?

*'''Patent nonsense.''' This article is far too vigorously defended from negative information, no matter how firmly rooted the negatives are in reliable sources. For instance, in September 2012 I tried to point the reader to published analysis of Browne's leadership, showing that a substantial vein of opinion exists that lays the blame for environmental disasters at Browne's feet, because of the corporate culture he set in place emphasizing profit above safety.[//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BP&diff=511481677&oldid=511470223] The response to this was immediate: reverted by Belchfire (now indef blocked). On the talk page [[Talk:BP/Archive_4#BLP_concerns_regarding_Browne_material|we discussed the concerns about BLP]], and I showed that Reuters UK, ''Fortune'', Bloomberg, ''The New York Times'', ''The Guardian'', CBS News and more had made this exact point. The next day I returned the material to the article, reinforced this time with more sources,[//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BP&diff=511748509&oldid=511745816] and it was immediately reverted by Rangoon11 (now indef blocked). We [[Talk:BP/Archive_6#Why_this_change_from_.22BP_traders.22_to_.22BP_Products_North_America_Inc._.28former_Amoco_Oil_Company.29.22|talked about the issue some more]], but the quantity of argument was superior (not the quality) for this widely reported analysis to stay out of the article. This experience cemented my impression that the article's defenders were not taking a balanced and neutral approach. Despite some personnel changes at this talk page, I am doubtful the culture has shifted to one of neutrality. I find it ludicrous that Martin Hogbin is making the case here that the imbalance falls the other way. Simply astounding.

{{rfcquote|text=
There have been a few discussions regarding QPQ recently, specifically, the fact that for non self noms, no QPQ is required. This seems to have been (I wasn't around when the rules were written) best summed up by {{U|Struway2}} in his statement {{User:MusikAnimal/Iqt|where someone nominates the work of a creator who already has 5+ DYKs, then the nominator should have to do a QPQ just like a self-nom would}}. However, this seems to be failing at present, there are many (myself included) nominators who don't do QPQ because it is not required, but leave a note first on the article creator's talk page asking them for permission. This should be the bare minimum, but personally I feel that something more strict, perhaps QPQ required after 5 non-self noms, would function better, and help with the amount of nominations. I may (depending on the amount of replies) begin a RFC on this soon.

Elsewhere on this page, another editor wrote an RFC about revising the [[WP:USPLACE]] naming guideline. Then another editor noted that these discussions arise at intervals, and proposed a moratorium on further discussion of the topic. Here I'm attempting to combine the two, along with a smattering of [[WP:CANPLACE]].

*The name of the state may be omitted when titling an article about a US city, provided that the city is unquestionably the primary topic for its name and the city proper had a population of at least 100,000 in the 2010 census (if [[List of United States cities by population]] is to be trusted, there are 389 cities which would meet this--admittedly arbitrary--population criterion). A redirect from [[Example City, State]] to [[Example City]] extant as of 1 January 1 2014 shall be sufficient evidence of the primary topic that a move or move request may be assumed to be uncontroversial.

*The name of the state may be omitted when titling an article about a US city, if the city's name is unique. If another topic shares the same name as the US city, but the other topic has no Wikipedia article, the name is unique only if a proper Wikipedia article could not be written about the other topic. Moves done without checking for uniqueness and availability of reliable sources may result in severe trouting!!

*This should go without saying, but if an article is moved from [[Example City, State]] to [[Example City]], retaining a redirect from [[Example City, State]] (or a disambiguation page, when "Example City, State" needs disambiguouation) is highly encouraged.

*Resolved: unless this goes horribly wrong, let's not make any more substantial changes to USPLACE until some time in the year 2016...that doesn't mean the discussion begins in 2014 or 2015, please. &mdash;[[User_talk:Rybec|<font color="black"><span style="background:#ccccff">rybec</span></font>]] 01:43, 10 January 2014 (UTC)}}

Moving the orphan tag is an inelegant and needlessly complicated process upon which the validation and ultimate removal becomes unworkable. An alternate and better option is to remove the banner portion of the template and make it function like [[:Template:Coord missing]]. The end result allows direct and no-mess tagging of orphaned articles and resolves the issue of those supporting the talk page move. I personally did not know about the RFC or would have commented - others have come to the same conclusion, but were also unaware. I believe that this resolves both parties issues with a more optimal solution in terms of those who place, check and remove the tags. To put it bluntly: The tag is gone from view and the banner won't choke the talk page where validating and removing won't occur.

:''This proposal is moved from the Idea Lab. That discussion may be found at [[Wikipedia:Village pump (idea lab)/Archive 12#Proposal for a Template Documentation: namespace]]. Update this link if it moves!''

Any template with even a shard of complexity has a corresponding documentation file... the end result being that [http://enwp.org/Special:AllPages?namespace=10 AllPages for templates] is chock full of /doc, /doc, /doc. For such a ubiquitous feature, I feel that it would be very justified for a new Template Documentation: namespace to contain all of these documentation pages. This way, we could have a clear dichotomy between template code to be transcluded, as opposed to whatever needs to be said or explained about the template (but, of course, not transcluded with the template).

Let's also consider taking the idea a few steps further. By its direct association with an existing Template: namespace, the new TD namespace has potential for some features not usually found in a run-of-the-mill new namespace.

;Automatic transclusion
:We could make the function of the {{T|Documentation}} template automatic: a Template: page, requiring ''no'' individually-paged code or template to do so, could automatically check for a corresponding Template Documentation: page and display that on the bottom of the Template page, with a little explanatory divider/footer separating the two - explanation similar to the format currently in place on {{T|Documentation}}. And of course, none of that documentation or divider explanation would be transcluded onto any pages using the Template page. If we did this, it would be very feasible for a fully-developed, fairly complex template, complete with documentation, to use ''zero'' includeonlies, and ''zero'' noincludes. None of that crap. {{T|Documentation}} could become a thing of the past.
:No documentation exists? "No documentation exists for this template. Click here to write some! &lt;link&gt;"
;Special pages
:Hard-coded associations between Template: pages and their Template Documentation: pages would enable us to look into additional Special pages: "Special:WithoutDocumentation", et cetera.
;Intelligent categories
:An infobox template about birds might be in [[:Category:Infobox templates]]. It might transclude [[:Category:Birds]] onto host pages which use it. This is logical, but to restrict the application in those ways we need more include rules. Ugly! My understanding is you simply must have include rules to use categories on a template page - because honestly, how often do categories apply to ''both'' templates and their host pages?
:A better system: we could declare that categories in the Template: page's code would only apply to host pages, while categories one wishes to apply to the Template: page itself are placed in the Template Documentation: page.

I think that this would be a really useful thing to have on Wikipedia, and if it's adequately implemented it opens the door for similar features on other wikis. =)

Merge per {{sc|[[WP:ENGLISH]]}} {{sc|[[WP:COMMONNAME]]}} and {{sc|[[WP:POVFORK]]}}. The simple fact is that in plain English, "surname" and "family name" are complete synonyms. [[Surname]] admits as much in its lead; [[family name]] tries to bury the idea by claiming surnames are "Western". It then proceeds to use "surname" more often than "family name" in its lead, while discussing surnames from all over the world and within historical contexts having nothing to do with the "West". The OED defines their primary current senses as:
::'''surname''': The name which a person bears in common with the other members of his family...; '''a family name'''
::'''family name''': A hereditary name shared by members of the same family, as distinct from a given or personal name; '''a surname'''.
There is a minor ''obsolete'' sense of surname in the use of "generic epithet" that occurs before the 19th century, but the {{sc|[[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]]}}s of these two name spaces entirely overlap as is displayed by the repeated attempts to merge them (see below) and by the pages' treatment of identical content.

Merge '''to''' [[surname]] (despite its article having a shorter history at Wiki) per {{sc|[[WP:ENGLISH]]}} {{sc|[[WP:COMMONNAME]]}}. Per [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=surname%2C+family+name%2C+last+name&year_start=1500&year_end=2020&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Csurname%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cfamily%20name%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Clast%20name%3B%2Cc0 ngram], "surname" has been more common than "family name" (usually by orders of magnitude) for the last 400 years; as can be seen at any age of Google Books, that additional usage had very little to do with the sense of "epithet". ("Last name" is on an upswing but obviously ''does'' have some {{sc|[[WP:BIAS]]}}y connection to European names.) Google Scholar brings back [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=%22family+name%22&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp= 85k hits] for "family name" (''often in its [[family (biology)|biological sense]]''), [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22last+name%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5 165k] generally on-point hits for "last name", and [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22surname%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5 135k] completely on-topic hits for "surname". Google Books and vanilla always break down a little on such common searches, but the estimates are (@books) [http://www.google.no/search?tbm=bks&hl=no&q=%22last+name%22#hl=no&newwindow=1&q=%22family+name%22+-wikipedia&tbm=bks 1.2m hits] for "family name" (mostly on topic), [http://www.google.no/search?tbm=bks&hl=no&q=%22last+name%22#hl=no&newwindow=1&q=%22last+name%22+-wikipedia&tbm=bks 1.7m hits] for "last name", and [http://www.google.no/search?tbm=bks&hl=no&q=%22last+name%22#hl=no&newwindow=1&q=surname+-wikipedia&tbm=bks 3.5m hits] for "surname" and (@van) [http://www.google.com.hk/search?q=%22family+name%22+-wikipedia 64.8m], [http://www.google.com.hk/search?q=%22last+name%22+-wikipedia&oq=%22last+name%22+-wikipedia 870m], and [http://www.google.com.hk/search?q=%22surname%22+-wikipedia 450m], all essentially confirming the ngram.

There have been failed merge attempts before. The voting on those went:
* '''merge''': Vltava 68, Knillis, RoryEAAS, II, Fgnievinski, Felix the Cassowary
* '''fork''': Undead, JDM1991, Rajakhr, Carsten12345, Ariadne55, Notwillywanka
Carsten objected because he had his own plan to revamp all Wikipedia's name articles. Undead, JDM, NWW, and Ariadne all objected because they all felt surname was a larger term that included things "family name" doesn't. Except that's untrue both in common usage and specifically: the OED definition of "patronymic" specifically discusses "family names" derived from the father and not "surnames". Meanwhile, any patronym or epithet that is not passed down (as in Iceland, Islamic names, etc.) is not a surname but an [[epithet]], a [[patronym]], a [[nisba]], etc. Even when certain foreign words (like ''nisba'' or ''[[xing (name)|xing]]'') are translated as "surname", the specifics of their use need to be addressed in a separate article and can't override the {{sc|PRIMARYTOPIC}} of "surname".

Felix the Cassowary captured the general confusion by saying he would really like a fork (since [[family name]] was considered overlong) but is forced to realize "...a distinction between "surnames" and "family names" is not one that I've ever made; I have long been under the impression (for instance) that Bjork doesn't have a surname, she has a patronym instead." At [[Talk:Surname]], WhisperToMe wondered what information the article could have that wasn't covered at [[family name]]; Propaniac replied that he'd just delete the page except "there should be a general article about surnames"

My thoughts? This fork is causing needless confusion and duplication and should be stopped already; family name is overlong and not the actual common name.

This section covers an alleged controversy related to alleged homophobic statements made by the son of [[Yelena Mizulina]], a Russian politician, who happens to work for the company that is the subject of the article. Part of the controversy is that the firm is allegedly LGBT-friendly, yet employs this person who is allegedly LGBT-hostile and whose mother is at the forefront of anti-LGBT activity in Russia. [https://sites.google.com/a/spectrumhr.org/www/hot-news-1/stillnoresponsefrommayerbrownlawfirmonlgbtconflictofinterests This source] in English (which might not be [[WP:RS|reliable]] to begin with) for example summarizes it as follows: ''Mr. Nikolay Mizulin made homophobic statements on his Facebook account that were quickly deleted after his employment with Mayer Brown was publicized''. I understand that the LGBT issue in Russia is a delicate and serious one, but ultimately unless reliable sources can be produced that prove the company's involvement in this, the material should be kept off the article, because it implies that the company is somehow guilty by association because one of its 1,500 employees said something stupid. I will note that none of the sources in Russian that I was able to read via Google Translate seem to imply or place any blame in the company ''per se''. Rather, the "controversy" seems to be with [[Alfred Koch]] attempting to attack Mizulina by claiming hypocrisy since her son lives and works in societies (Belgium and the UK) where LGBT people have much more freedom and security. For example, running [http://www.newsru.com/russia/06jun2013/mizulin.html this] through Google shows a report on a series of rather snide Facebook posts and tweets about Mizulina and her son. All this is well and good, but ultimately it belongs in the Mizulina biography, not in the Mayer Brown article, which doesn't even operate in Russia.

Anybody any thoughts on this? There's some fascinating info that people have added to this article. I personally though found this hindered in terms of clarity by long sections that could be improved in terms of readability. I've had a go at:-

* adding some section headings to reduce the section size
* structuring things into a more logical sequence (eg having the WW2 sections next to each other)
* Tidying up what I think were formatting errors with some sections not being correctly aligned

Even with that, I'm still not convinced its yet perfect and does justice to what was a remarkable aircraft. There in though possibly lies part of the problem. For an aeroplane with so many points of note, its going to toy with our heads in terms of finding and deciding the optimum structure.

There seems to be some disagreement about whether or not major Anatomy articles should be split into two: a "Human" article, and an article about another species. For example: [[Mandible]] and [[Human mandible]]; [[Nose]] and [[Human nose]]; [[Liver]] and [[Human liver]], etc. 

There appears to be disagreement on many levels regarding this. On the one hand, there are legitimate concerns that the majority of users will be searching for articles relating to humans. Additionally, splitting articles may reduce the quality and impact on readability. On the other hand, it is more than encyclopedic to cover anatomy in other articles, it could be argued that this is an example of one of Wikipedia's [[WP:BIAS|systemic biases]], and there is no reason why comparative anatomy shouldn't be covered.

Due to the scope of the issue, involvement of multiple wikiprojects and users on multiple articles over an extended period, I feel it will be useful to gather feedback using the RfC mechanism. I have stated four principles here:
# Articles about comparative and human anatomy should be provided on the same page, when such differences are minor.
# Articles about comparative anatomy should be provided on a separate page, when such differences are major.
#When provided on separate pages, the primary page (eg [[Liver]]) should be about the human organ, and a secondary page (eg [[Liver (animals)]]) provided to describe other animals.
#When provided on separate pages, -the primary page (eg [[Liver]]) should be in general form about all manifestations, and a secondary page (eg [[Human liver]]) provided for the human organ.

A list is provided here:

*[[Abdomen]] and [[Human abdomen]]
*[[Anus]] and [[Human anus]]
*[[Back]] and [[Human back]]
*[[Body]] and [[Human body]]

Hi *! I believe the rule that NFC use of images is not permissible for living persons on the grounds that a free photo could in theory be created is patent nonsense and should be abolished. Either we assume that sometimes NFC is useful to improve Wikipedia, in which case it is counter-productive to delete images that demonstrably enhance an article when there is actually no free replacement available. Or we don't, in which case no use of NFC should be permitted at all. The rule as it stands is not consistent from either point of view, and it is being used (abused, in my opinion) by over-eager patrol users to randomly shoot down content that has been added by other editors with careful consideration. Several cases are documented where new WP contributors have been put off by the enforcement of this rule.

Side note: I'm absolutely behind the idea that we should use and produce as much free content as possible, but I also think that WP should not unduly restrict fair use rights - to the contrary, it should make a point to support those fair use rights, within reasonable limits. The NFC rules as they stand now seem to attract policy zealots without much concern for the articles in question, which is a very frustrating situation.

I want to standardize the inclusion or placement of TemplateData. As it is now, TemplateData is included on doc pages in several different ways; sometime included in the documentation, other times in template itself, either directly or transcluded from /TemplateData. This is not a desirable situation. I would like to establish a standard on where and how to include TemplateData into the documentation (or elsewhere). So,

* Where should TemplateData be placed?
*# In the template page
*# In the /Documentation (/doc) sub page
*# In the /TemplateData (/[...]data) sub page
* Where should it be placed visually?
*# Inside the documentation area
*# Outside/below the documentation area
* How should it be displayed?

Let's state the obvious: Ever since Bitcoin hit the scene, people have loved using, exchanging, and creating [[cryptocurrencies]]. There are also a ton of these various altcoins. Some, like [[Peercoin]], [[Namecoin]], [[Dogecoin]], and [[Coinye West]] are among the few lesser altcoins that have met notability standards and then gone a little beyond in some cases, like [[Litecoin]]. However, most of these brand new and existing lesser altcoins are also getting articles when in fact they don't meet or barely meet any standards at all. Five subjects regarding cryptocurrency, with admittedly me being the prime nominator except for a [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mastercoin|few]] [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Peercoin|articles]], are taking place right now, almost all of them are hitting the same arguments, and almost all will surely get deleted without any improvement within the next few days.

"Well, why don't you improve them, you big deletionist meanie?"

Because you really can't, regardless if you're digging hard for sources other than blogs and forum posts. Because of the influx of altcoin articles being created and nominated, several editors have raised the proposal of new standards, or at the very least an essay serving as a basic viewpoint '''specific''' for all of these coins during various deletion discussions. I'm starting this to ask for the community to have a discussion on the willingness to propose such standards or viewpoints. Hopefully, the end result will end in a productive discussion.

Does the point #14 of [[Wikipedia:Splitting#How_to_properly_split_an_article]] and in broader sense [[Wikipedia:Summary style]] apply to this and other passport articles? I am referring to split-out articles on Visa requirements for holders of this and other passports. Those articles were split out from articles on passports and the question is should they be linked through a summary section or not. Also does the discussion from [[Talk:Passport/Archive_2#Removing_the_.22visa-free_travel.22_blocks_in_passport_articles]] say anything about the style of linking to split-out articles (note: discussion took place in 2010 when the Summary and splitting style guidelines were significantly less developed which can be checked on history of those pages, so it is also an issue of precedence) or was it only a decision regarding the faith of Visa-free blocks. Thank you very much. P.S. I don't think a survey is necessary here, rather an opinion on what rules apply.--[[User:Twofortnights|Twofortnights]] ([[User talk:Twofortnights|talk]]) 22:32, 15 December 2013 (UTC)}}

Does Southeast Africa deserve its own article with full coverage of history, economics, demographics or should there just be a list of the countries in the region (which in fact was incorrect as it included countries in southeastern Africa which is not the same as the region of Southeast Africa, but this is an additional separate issue) as the article was before. Again this question does not concern what countries are included in Southeast Africa - that is clearly up for debate. But here the request for comment is whether Wikipedia should have any kind of fleshed out article on this region at all or is this region and its peoples and histories too inconsequential for such a page? If not, should the article be kept as is and coverage of countries argued to be in the region and not yet included subsequently added to it or should the entire effort be discarded in the waste basket?Regards, [[User:Andajara120000|Andajara120000]] ([[User talk:Andajara120000|talk]]) 02:58, 1 January 2014 (UTC)}}

:Inequality in land and income ownership is negatively correlated with subsequent economic growth. A strong demand for redistribution will occur in societies where a large section of the population does not have access to the productive resources of the economy. Rational voters must internalize such issues. ({{cite journal|last=Alesina|first=Alberto|coauthors=Dani Rodrick|title=Distributive Politics and Economic Growth|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|year=1994|month=May|volume=109|issue=2|pages=465-90|doi=10.2307/2118470|url=http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/109/2/465.full.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2013}}) High unemployment rates have a significant negative effect when interacting with increases in inequality. Increasing inequality harms growth in countries with high levels of urbanization. High and persistent unemployment also has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth. Unemployment may seriously harm growth because it is a waste of resources, because it generates redistributive pressures and distortions, because it depreciates existing human capital and deters its accumulation, because it drives people to poverty, because it results in liquidity constraints that limit labor mobility, and because it erodes individual self-esteem and promotes social dislocation, unrest and conflict. Policies to control unemployment and reduce its inequality-associated effects can strengthen long-run growth.

This is a science related article. Science rejects creationism. So no usage of mentioning religion. There are lots of religions and various other foolish believes. Mentioning about them in a ''scientific'' article is very ironical. These blood-related believes should be collectively created as a seperate article and only a link to that article should be included in this article.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should [[WP:TFL|Today's featured list]] appear twice a week on the [[Main page]], rather than just on Mondays?

'''Background'''

In June 2011 a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMain_Page&diff=433807189&oldid=433806297 unanimously supported] proposal to add [[WP:Today's featured list|Today's featured list]] (TFL) to the Main Page every Monday was passed. Since 13 June 2013 a FL has appeared on the front page every Monday. Following a discussion on [[Wikipedia talk:Today's featured list#Expansion of TFL on the main page]], it was agreed that there is sufficient interest to run the TFL at least twice a week.

The FL process is strong, healthy and can cope with a second slot on the front page. As of 3 December 2013 there are 2,533 featured lists; in the first 11 months of 2013, 209 lists were promoted (and 239 during 2012), and all naturally meet the current criteria demanded by the community. There are, therefore, a sufficient number of high-quality lists available from which to select.

Featured lists, like their article counterparts, cover a hugely wide-ranging set of topics. An extra day per week on the main page will allow the FL community to both increase the diversity of those lists featured and enable us to schedule time-specific lists on appropriate dates, or within a closer timeframe than we currently do.

'''Why additional day/s'''

Featured lists are a strong and healthy part of the project's output and they provide content whose standards are as exacting as other Featured output. In order to best showcase that output, it is considered appropriate to raise its profile by showcasing the finest lists we have on the main page.

*Display the diversity of the FL output
*Allow more flexibility for date-specific listings

Although there were calls during the discussion for lists to be run on three days, two days would enable a strong diversity to be maintained. <s>A suggestion was also made for a "floating day", to be used intermittently on specific dates. Although the consensus was against this for a second day, it may be suitable as a potential third day, on an intermittant basis for key events.</s>

'''Practicalities'''

There are currently over 2,500 featured lists, over 200 of which have been selected during 2013. These recently promoted articles will, by definition, meet the current criteria of featured status as defined by community consensus. Even through selection of just the articles passed this year, there is a sufficient number to be able to select two articles a week. There is also a sufficiently diverse pool of lists from which we are able to select the TFL, in order that we avoid appearing too Western-centric.

'''Technical points'''

Technical impact on the main page is nil. The current code for TFL was written with the anticipation that it could be expanded to more then one day in the future.

'''Summary'''

# We seek a set second day for TFLs on the main page: Mondays and either Thursday or Friday.
# <s>A potential third list scheduled when there is date relevance, and when there is consensus to do so.</s>

Featured lists have enriched the main page now for over a year without any serious issues. I hope the community would agree that allowing us to feature <s>at least</s> twice a week would enrich the project. - [[User:SchroCat|SchroCat]] ([[User talk:SchroCat|talk]]) 08:30, 4 January 2014 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
By the RFC at [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/Archive_107#Proposed_new_Draft_namespace]], the ''[[Wikipedia:Drafts|Draft]]'' namespace was created. With the creation of this namespace, it supercedes the [[Wikipedia:Article Incubator|Article Incubator]] in its function, while also serving as a more logical location for drafts. The roll-out of the new Draft mainspace, an area where pages are not indexed, where AfC submissions will be processed, rescued articles can be parked, and for users' use for their drafts, makes the Incubator essentially redundant. Therefore, this RFC proposes to close the incubator and shift all of it's articles to draftspace.

The two changes proposed are-
:# The current Article Incubator project will be disbanded and it's pages will be marked historical.
:# The [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixIndex&prefix=Article+Incubator&namespace=4&hideredirects=1 fifteen or so] articles in the Incubator will be shifted to the draft space.
:# Additionally, any editors who are currently interested in working with the Incubator can carry out the same functions using the Draft namespace, ie to find draft articles and helping improve them to the mainspace.

Several editors feel that the list of items below ought to be a part of this article. Others believe that such additions must pass over a reasonably high bar prior to inclusion. The matter has become heated on this talk page and now elsewhere. To attempt to remove the heat the article and now the talk page have been semi-protected. That is simply history, and will explain why IP editors may not, for the moment, comment here. However that protection will expire shortly, and it is likely that the heat will return to the discussion.

Please would experienced editors inspect the proposed additions, ideally item by item, and consider for each whether it has a place in the article. Only by placid, collegiate consensus building can we decide whether these items are appropriate in the article. A full rationale for or against will be helpful.  Editors should note that some of the urls appear to have been added in haste. Correcting these would be a further bonus.

This sentence - ''Argentina recognises the UK government as the only legitimate partner in negotiations.'' - represents a tenuously paraphrased construction of two separate sources that does not adequately encapsulate the Argentine position and misrepresents it through a process of simplification. I would like to respectfully ask for a discussion about a possible change of this sentence to a short phrase or two that more adequately demonstrates the robustness of the Argentine position, ''to wit'', that negotiations must occur on a state-to-state level. As currently worded it simply makes the Argentine position with respect to the #a##### Islands sound dully obstinate. I'm not suggesting specific wording at this time as I'd first like to see if there is even a chance people would be amenable to considering a change, which may be a high hurdle in itself.

'''''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]''''' is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court ruled that [[citizenship in the United States|citizens of the United States]] may not be deprived of their citizenship involuntarily.  The U.S. government had attempted to revoke the citizenship of Beys Afroyim, a [[Poland|Polish]]-born man who had voted in an [[Israel]]i election after having become a [[naturalization|naturalized]] U.S. citizen, but the Supreme Court decided that Afroyim's right to retain his citizenship was guaranteed by the [[Citizenship Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution]]. In so doing, the Court overruled one of its own [[precedent]]s, ''[[Perez v. Brownell]]'' (1958), in which it had upheld loss of citizenship under similar circumstances less than a decade earlier. The ''Afroyim'' decision opened the way for a wider acceptance of [[multiple citizenship|dual (or multiple) citizenship]] in United States law. The [[Bancroft Treaties]]—a series of agreements between the United States and other nations which had sought to limit dual citizenship following naturalization—were eventually abandoned after the [[Carter administration]] concluded that ''Afroyim'' and other Supreme Court decisions had rendered them unenforceable. {{TFAFULL|Afroyim v.

Should the ''main'' tag also be used at the top of articles for purpose #2 (as discussed above -- to tag an article that is ''not'' the main article for its topic e.g. see [[history of Bitcoin]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Bitcoin&oldid=587683100]) or should it remain recommend only for its well-established purpose #1 to point to the main article ''only'' in summary sections elsewhere? Actually looking at [[#Main and Details]] one section before the most recent dispute, there problems are deeper. I see several solutions.

# Use ''main'' only in summary sections to point to an expansion article (was the status quo for years). But this seems to confuse at least some users and ''{{tl|details}}'' is a sort of alias, but not quite.
# Use only ''details'' in summary sections to point to an expansion article (as some tried to do in 2012). Use ''main'' only in the sub-article lead to point to the main article. There are some foreign-language Wikipedias which have such an arrangement.
# Allow dual-use ''main'' in both article leads (to point to parent-topic article) and in summary sections to point to expansion article. This was the most recent proposal discussed above. ''Details'' remains an alias for the section-level purpose.
# Turn ''main'' into a redirect to ''details'', which has less ambiguous language.

For other variants, write your own proposal... There's also {{tl|further}} to consider, which is more or less another clone of {{tl|details}}.

The BB centennial was declared by ''Inc.'' the "public relations triumph of 1983." This demonstrates, to a 2014 audience, the scope and currency of contemporaneous views toward the celebration, without which, no description of fireworks and photo opps does the "centennial" section justice. Common sense seems like the addition of one sentence mentioning that fact would be a pretty straightforward [[WP:BOLD]] edit, however, [[User:InternetMeme|InternetMeme]] and [[User:Hertz1888|Hertz1888]] have reverted my edit because, they allege, I am attempting to engage in [[WP:PROMOTION]] for [[Dudley-Anderson-Yutzy]], the company that organized the centennial celebrations ... '''''and which went out of business in 1983'''''. For the record, I am not currently paid to promote Dudley-Anderson-Yutzy and, in case anyone is wondering, I'm also not currently being paid to promote the [[Dutch East India Company]] or [[George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972|George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign]] (though I have made edits to those pages as well). I have even offered Hertz1888 the opportunity to raise this strange allegation in ANI and proactively offered to post a scan of my passport to establish the fact I wasn't even born when Dudley-Anderson-Yutzy went out of business ... again, '''''in 1983!'''''

{{rfcquote|text=
The international standard [[ISO 8601]] describes the date format YYYY-MM-DD (for example, 20 May 1875 would be written 1875-05-20). The [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers]] allows this format in articles in situations where conciseness is important, and also recognizes the restriction contained in ISO 8601:
* that dates in the format must be [[Gregorian calendar]] dates, and 
* that the year must be at least 1583.
(See the table [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers&oldid=592413674#Date_formats here], left column, fifth row).

'''Should these restrictions be removed''', so that the format could also be used for Julian calendar dates (for example the birth date of [[Gregory XII]] could be written 1503-01-07)?

'''Discussion of ISO 8601 and YYYY-MM-DD'''

As the originator of the RFC, I oppose this change, on the grounds that ISO 8601 and the YYYY-MM-DD have been [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers&diff=next&oldid=1722671 mentioned together] in the "Manual of Style/Dates and numbers" since 2003 (although I don't think there has ever been a well-thought-out adoption of the standard, with consideration of all the complications in articles containing old dates). I also oppose the change because I cannot find any reliable source that describes the YYYY-MM-DD format without also mentioning that it is part of ISO 8601 and that the dates must be Gregorian (except some brief sources such as ISO's [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm capsule description]). It would novel for Wikipedia to create a parallel meaning for this format that allows the format to represent Julian calendar dates.

What portals, if any, are appropriate at [[Prometheus (2012 film)]]? There are four opinions I have found in the archives that pertain to this film, so they can be thought of as four proposals: 5 portals, no (0) portals, ''no more than'' the number of relevant portals belonging to three WikiProjects, and 5 portals (with one being different than the first).

* '''Proposal A''': I had included the following portals [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prometheus_%282012_film%29&offset=&limit=500&action=history see diff]:
* 2010s - Decade that the film was released
* Film - General portal on film (I had mistakenly added this portal twice in the diff)
* Film in the United States - Since some production companies are from the United States
* United Kingdom - Since other production companies are British
* Science fiction - Genre

* '''Proposal B''': [[User:Darkwarriorblake]] argued that no portals are appropriate, and removed the portals I had added. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prometheus_(2012_film)&diff=550537907&oldid=550419207 Diff #1], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prometheus_%282012_film%29&diff=550538018&oldid=550537907 Diff #2 which removed remaining portals] - As of writing [[Prometheus_(2012_film)]] has ''no portals''.

* '''Proposal C''': [[User:Betty Logan]] stated at [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Film/Archive_46#Use_of_Portals_in_film_articles]] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Film&diff=550520063&oldid=550518230 Diff]): "The Film portal is listed twice at Prometheus! For what it's worth though, I don't think portals belonging to other projects should be installed on articles that do not come within their scope.

I have reverted the recent addition of what I believe is controversial and unhelpful material to the article - a specific paragraph as follows from user Bladesmulti, which he keeps bringing back:

"In Hindu Sanatana Dharma theology Brahm/Parabrahma is the one unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality which is the Divine Ground of all things in this Universe.[56] If one adds two whole parts the result is one whole and if one whole is subtracted from another whole the result is another whole – it means there is one whole universe and it is all pervaded by Trimurti. Since the universe has come forth from the Divine, all things and beings are sacred and must be treated so in human thought and action. The Divine sleeps in minerals, awakens in plants, walks in animals and thinks in humans.[57]"

I have reverted these edits and requested discussion but Bladesmulti puts back the material and falsely claims it is "agreed upon changes". This has gotten obnoxious and will require an administrator to help us if it continues. My reasoning for reverting was that "Hindu Sanatana Dharma theology" is extremely obscure and its presence in this article would be giving it undue weight. Furthermore, the explanation adds nothing to this article on the Hinduism/pantheism relationship that I can discern or that Bladesmulti has explained. After reading the source, it appears the addition is being justified by original research and/or some kind of synthesis. Also, Bladesmulti should not misstate issues and title a talk section "Removal of Hinduism" when no such attempt was made.

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
The international standard [[ISO 8601]] describes the date format YYYY-MM-DD (for example, 20 May 1875 would be written 1875-05-20). The [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers]] allows this format in articles in situations where conciseness is important, and also recognizes the restriction contained in ISO 8601:
* that dates in the format must be [[Gregorian calendar]] dates, and 
* that the year must be at least 1583.
(See the table [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers&oldid=592413674#Date_formats here], left column, fifth row).

'''Should these restrictions be removed''', so that the format could also be used for Julian calendar dates (for example the birth date of [[Gregory XII]] could be written 1503-01-07)?

There has been disagreement between editors on which convention to use for the units in this article. For UK engineering-related articles, the MOSNUM convention is to use the system of units in which the relevant infrastructure was designed as the primary units (so one would expect imperial (metric) for older engineering and metric (imperial) for newer engineering). Four editors have offered opinions on the subject, of whom three agree that metric units should be given first in the article. One editor has argued that the article is not really engineering-related and thus the MOSNUM rule about engineering units does not apply here. The discussion does not seem to have come to a natural conclusion, so external help would be useful. [[User:Archon 2488|Archon 2488]] ([[User talk:Archon 2488|talk]]) 11:51, 20 January 2014 (UTC)}}

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
There is a [[Wikipedia:Controversial articles|difference of opinion]] concerning the wording of [[WP:Lede|lead sections]] of articles about [[List of Los Angeles neighborhoods|Los Angeles neighborhoods]].

Specifically, there have been objections raised as to how and when it is appropriate to include the ethnic composition of a neighborhood in the lead. On the other hand, there is an opinion that such a description can be a valid part of the introduction. (The reasoning for both opinions is given below in the discussion.)

Several neighborhood articles have featured leads that opened the lead with the name of the neighborhood followed by a quantitative description of its population. For example:
Century City is a 176-acre (712,000-m2) affluent commercial and residential district in the West Los Angeles region of Los Angeles County, California.[1] The 5,900+ residents make up an older-aged, high-income, 82.5% white, well-educated population.

'''Objection: only highlighting percentage of whites is ethnic or racial bias'''

An objection was raised by one user of the need for several of these articles to "disproportionately highlight the white population as ethnic or racial bias." On this article as on many, the white population is highlighted in the lead. This action was challenged as ethnic or racial bias because it was argued that this practice unfairly highlighted the white population as the marker for how desirable an area might be or some other improper purpose for an encyclopedia. Moreover, it excluded other racial categories and repeated information already found in the demographics section of an article. The question is what is gained from highlighting whites over another in the lead when it is nothing particularly notable about that area? 

For example, it was said, that several areas of Los Angeles are known for it being a hub of a particular group, e.g. Sawtelle for Japanese community, Pico-Robertson for Jewish people, Pico-Union for recent latino immigrants or Pacific Palisades for having the highest concentration of white residents in the City of Los Angeles. These practices were not objected to because they were notable characteristics. It is having several articles starting with the lead of % of white people that were objected when they is nothing particularly notable about it other than a just one of several neighborhoods of having a significant number of whites.

'''Defense: (Insert here main argument for keeping this practice)'''

This proposal is pretty wrong-headed. A lead (or lede) is supposed to serve "as an introduction to the article and a summary of its most important aspects." Whatever is in the article should be summarized, so if the racial composition is included in the article and the essence of that composition is important, then the measurement of that composition should be part of the lead. It cannot be denied that the racial composition of any neighborhood is important to that neighborhood and to the city at large, therefore if the racial characteristics are mentioned in the story (as they should be) then they should also be a part of the lead (so that the reader can quickly grasp exactly what ''kind'' of a neighborhood it is). This is not a matter of "good" or "bad," but a simple description of the facts.

The same reasoning goes for the rest of the lead: It should sum up the important aspects of the story, no matter what they are. [[User:GeorgeLouis|GeorgeLouis]] ([[User talk:GeorgeLouis|talk]]) 05:55, 1 January 2014 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I propose that several sections of this page be promoted to policy status, specifically [[Wikipedia:SIG#Images]], [[Wikipedia:SIG#Signature forgery]], and [[Wikipedia:SIG#Appearance and color]]. One reason is [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive824#W.C5.8Ddenhelm.27s_sig]] (and other similar cases) in which an editor is (or was at least) refusing to remove multiple images from a sig, possibly in part because this is "only a guideline". Some commentators in the ANI thread are urging that such action be treated more lightly because this is "only a guideline". Given the way wikipedia policy is generally formed, by use, this standard is so widely adhered to that it is a policy ''de facto'' and we might as well say so. Much the same applies to the two other sections I suggest as policy. Blinking sigs, especially, can cause  actual harm (I have been present when one caused a seizure) and have no significant value to the project, and the reasons not to tolerate signature forgery are obvious, I would think. So let us mark these items as policy without further ado. [[User:DESiegel|DES]] [[User talk:DESiegel|<sup>(talk)</sup>]] 23:13, 2 January 2014 (UTC)}}

Should Anglican priests be categorised by:

# their own nationality (e.g. [[:Category:English Anglican priests]])
# the Anglican denomination(s) in which they served (e.g. [[:Category:Church of England priests]])
# both by nationality and by denomination  (e.g. [[:Category:English Anglican priests]] and [[:Category:Church of England priests]])

This RFC arises out of a [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2013_November_2#Category:English_Anglican_priests|CFD discussion]] on [[:Category:English Anglican priests]], which I have just closed as "no consensus".  As I noted in the closing statement:<blockquote style="font-style:italic">There is broad agreement that the current category doesn't work, but no agreement on the solution.<br /> As it stands, this category is labelled as a category-by-nationality, but as a sub-category of [[:Category:Church of England clergy]] it is also used a by-denomination set (grouping priests of the [[Church of England]]). Removing this category from [[Category:Church of England clergy]] would remove most CoE priests from the COE categories; but renaming it per the nominator's proposal would mean that those English people who are priests in another Anglican denomination would me miscategorised. The parent [[:Category:Anglican priests by nationality]] is an assortment of categories by nationality and categories by denomination, and it seems that only in the case of Scotland do we have both: a denominational [[:Category:Scottish Episcopalian priests]] and a nationality [[:Category:Scottish Anglican priests]].</blockquote>

I want to start by being very clear that I am only commenting on the instructional text on the project page, not on the project itself (which I actually think quite highly of)...

Hi. I am a long time lurker and relatively new editor. I recently learned about NPP and wanted to offer an observation from a new set of eyes: As I read the project page what struck me was that (A) this project is a vital function for Wikipedia, and (B) the project ''instructions'' leave a strong ''perception'' that they are heavily unbalanced ''against'' [[WP:Deletion_is_not_cleanup|Deletion_is_not_cleanup]]. I make this bold statement by observing a simple hard fact:

I ''do'' realize that statistically NPP will most likely find abusive and/or garbage pages yet the "taste" (if I can use that word) that this project page leaves in one's mouth is that NPP is pretty much a place designed for [[WP:Deletionist]]s to <strike>get their kicks</strike> work. Having also read the discussion on this very talk page it strikes me that perhaps, just perhaps, one of the reasons you are having trouble getting and/or keeping active helpers in this project is because of such an imbalance. Perhaps if the project page ''instructions'' are made more '''affirmative''' in promoting taking actions to '''improve''' new pages (and again I ''do'' understand the realities of what you encounter) and to '''improve''' (train) new users you might be able to see your ranks grow with some possibly here-to-fore ''alienated'' [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Transwiki:Constructionism_and_reductionism_%28wiki%29#Constructionism Constructionists].

OK, for those of you who dislike abbreviations, QPQ is short for 'Quid pro quo', which is described as "a favour or advantage granted in return for something", in the DYK project, it refers to the fact that when you nominate your own article, you need to review someone elses. DYK, as most people know, refers to the 'Did You Know' section of the main page. The abbreviation 'noms' refers to nominations. Recently, we have seen lots of drive by nominations of other editors' work, the first they hear about it is when they get the credit on their talk page. The general consensus of [[Wikipedia_talk:Did_you_know#QPQ|the discussion]] seemed to be that something had to be done to stop drive by nominations of other editors work, or even nominations of another editor's work with their permission, with no QPQ required.

{{rfcquote|text=
As currently structured, this category is a subcategory of {{cl|Political fiction}}, and is thus meant for scripted drama or comedy series which present a ''fictionalized'' portrait of politics — however, due to the ambiguity of its current name it's often misused for news and talk and documentary series about real-world politics as well. There may be a valid case to be made that there should be a category for that kind of series too, but the ''current'' iteration of this category is not the correct place for them, because they're not fiction — and regardless, political non-fiction series should not be ''mixed'' with scripted fiction series in the ''same'' category. 

Accordingly, I'd like to initiate a discussion about how best to handle this. Should we:
#Split it up into separate subcategories for political fiction and political non-fiction series?
#Rename the current category to make its "fiction" intentions clearer, but ''don't'' create a new category for the non-fiction kind because {{cl|News television series}} is already sufficient?
#Leave everything as is and just watch as needed to clean up misfiled entries? [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] ([[User talk:Bearcat|talk]]) 18:01, 5 January 2014 (UTC)}}

So this is a discussion onto whether the anime(s) should be compiled into one article or be merged back to the main article. Now at first glance, the article looks well supported but the article compiles two completely different series: Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.

Now that the RM just above has been withdrawn, perhaps we can have a general RfC about what the best name for the article about "Broadway", the noted street which originates in Manhattan, is nicknamed the "The Canyon of Heroes" downtown and "The Great White Way" in the [[Theatre District, New York City|Theatre District]], then runs through the Bronx, and continues as Route 9A through Westchester County, where in many localities, but not all, it is called "Broadway".  The last RM about it was 2 1/2 years ago, and had very little response.  Since there's a current focus here at the moment, perhaps we can get more of a variety of opinions.

I believe that I've listed below, each in their own subsection, the viable options.  Could we !vote and discuss each option within each section, in order to get a sense of what the consensus is?

There was already a '''very''' strong consensus for a content merge from this [[Opium Wars]] article to the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]] articles but given that it hasn't happened yet and another three years of editing have gone into the page, I feel we should restart the discussion and see how people feel in 2014.

# The content from [[Opium Wars]] is merged from here to the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]] articles.

[[WP:Pending changes|Pending changes]] is a feature that requires an administrator or [[WP:User access levels#Reviewer|reviewer]] to accept some changes to pages before they "go live" (become visible to IP users). It has two levels, referred to as PC1 and PC2. A page configured to use PC1 requires that edits made by new or anonymous users be reviewed, while [[Wikipedia:User access levels#Autoconfirmed users|autoconfirmed users']] edits are automatically accepted. A page configured to use PC2 requires that edits made by any users other than administrators or reviewers must be reviewed. The following chart further explains these details:

At this time, consensus to allow use of PC2 has been achieved{{Dubious |What the question ought to be here |reason=Not at all cear that consensus has been achieved |date=January 2014}}, but it requires that criteria for its use exist, which is what this RfC aims to establish.

Hi all, as some of you will know, some time ago there was [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Russia/Archive_3#Using_accent_marks_to_indicate_stress a proposal] to remove stress marks from Russian words that appear inside the text of articles on the English Wikipedia. The decision was to keep the stress marks, as there is consensus that they are useful.

Because they are useful, some of us are interested in taking this to the next level, and actively add stress marks to as many articles as possible. We'll only work on Russian words that appear inside calls to the lang-ru template, and we will only add the stress marks when we are sure that it is safe to do so, that is, that the information is correct and there is no ambiguity.

Could I please ask you guys if there is consensus for this task? I would really appreciate your support, because I want to improve as many articles as possible.

Thanks very much, [[User:Azylber|Azylber]] ([[User talk:Azylber|talk]]) 23:21, 8 January 2014 (UTC)}}

As per my argument above, we had a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C4%90or%C4%91e_Pelinovi%C4%87&diff=589750809&oldid=589750404 move] of the article from Gjergj Pelini (name in Albanian, and used by Albanian scholars, and some international ones (Elsie and Hetzer) to the current name, Đorđe Pelinović, used exclusively by Serbian scholars). 

Since significant coverage in English doesn't exist, we have to go by consensus for this. Policy says in [[WP:English]] says:

''It can happen that an otherwise notable topic has not yet received much attention in the English-speaking world, so that there are too few English sources to constitute an established usage. Very low Google counts can but need not be indicative of this. If this happens, follow the conventions of the language in which this entity is most often talked about (German for German politicians, Turkish for Turkish rivers, Portuguese for Brazilian towns etc.).''
''If, as will happen, there are several competing foreign terms, a neutral one is often best.''

According to this policy, and also taking upon how the only scholar we can find in English (Elsie) [http://books.google.com/books?id=pgf6GWJxuZgC&pg=PA353&dq=gjergj+pelini&hl=en&sa=X&ei=kirPUufOJJTykQecyIHwBg&ved=0CDEQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&q=gjergj%20pelini&f=false calls Pelini/Pelinović in English], I suggest that the article be moved to [[Georgius Pellinus]]. The other party (Antidiskriminator) is not consenting to this. A comment will be appreciated.--[[User:Perkohesisht ai i vjetri|Perkohesisht ai i vjetri]] ([[User talk:Perkohesisht ai i vjetri|talk]]) 23:02, 9 January 2014 (UTC)}}

I have come up with a draft copy edit for the disputed article. I invite all concerned to contribute so we can finally resolve this issue. 


Proposed draft: (Subject to changes)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
'''Dispute and Conflicting Points of View'''

The Academia Militar de Malolos was founded on October 25, 1898 by the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]]  fighting the Americans. It was closed on Jan. 20, 1899 due to highly escalated tensions between the Filipinos and Americans.

Questions have been raised regarding the validity and veracity of the Philippine Military Academy's claim it traces its roots to the Academia Militar de Malolos. This claim is disputed because historically the PMA is known as the predecessor of the American established Officer's School of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] and the Philippine Constabulary Academy. 

A third party study should be done before any claim can be sufficiently established or refuted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: I encourage everyone concerned to suggest changes. Again, I invite all to contribute so we can finally resolve this issue.--[[User:Wiki Exterminator|Wiki Exterminator]] ([[User talk:Wiki Exterminator|talk]]) 01:07, 10 January 2014 (UTC)}}

I want to propose the addition of the [[Portal:Film in the United States]]. I created this portal as an adaptation of the [[:fr:Portail:Cinéma américain]].

Some editors believe this portal (Portal:Film in the United States) is tangential to an article on an individual film and are only relevant to general/overall topics, and therefore this portal should not be included. I argue that this film has been perceived as one of the best examples of American film by reliable sources and therefore this portal is relevant and not tangential. Since there has only been a limited number of editors in this discussion, I am putting this forward as an RFC. Discussion may take place in the article talk page.

"The charges will remain pending until such time as she can be brought to Court to face the charges..."]]
[[File:Khobragade, Devyani Indictment.djvu|thumb|9 January 2014 [[indictment]] of Khobragade, which was issued immediately after she left the country]]

'''Dispute :'''Inclusion of the Court documents in a current active court case  ([[indictment]] & supporting letters by the prosecution) -  within a Wikipedia article. 

'''Question to answer in this RfC:'''
*Should this Wikipedia article link to the court documents shown here? If yes, then in what way should they be linked?

'''Location of dispute :''' [[Devyani Khobragade incident]] - The article details the events and reaction about the arrest and later indictment of Devyani Khobragade, an Indian diplomat, by the United States government. The issue received a large amount of media coverage in both the United States in India. 

'''Details of the disputed document :''' When Khobragade was indicted, the Department of Justice publicized the official [[indictment]] document detailing the prosecution's allegations of crime against the defendant and a related letter discussing the document. The information in the [[indictment]] and the letter were covered by media. Per US law, the documents are public domain and are uploaded to Wikimedia Commons. The manner in which the documents were included within the article are shown here in the right.

'''Arguments for'''
#These documents are the primary sources from which most media sources are derived, and as such, are relevant to this article and would be interesting to people visiting this article.
#Everyone is clear that these documents should not be cited, used to develop text in the article, or use to prove anything. Their content is entirely covered by secondary sources. They are serving an illustrative purpose much in the same way that a photo would.
#Unusually, the Department of Justice has publicized these documents for distribution. Perhaps this is because they thought that these documents are relevant to people who want to learn about the case. It seems right to use Wikipedia to offer the media files promoted by parties to the incident.

'''Arguments against'''
#It seems unusual to post court documents for a contemporary active legal issue. [[Lavabit#Connection_to_Edward_Snowden|See Edward Snowden document]] for the only other identified example, which also could be controversial.
#The documents are accusatory and promote a POV by stating that sufficient evidence exists to charge the diplomat with a crime. Sharing an indictment on Wikipedia may violate [[WP:NPOV]] and [[WP:BLP]] policy.
#Sharing these documents may violate [[WP:PRIMARY]].
#[[WP:BLPPRIMARY]] says, "Do not use trial transcripts and other court records, or other public documents, to support assertions about a living person."
#Wikipedia is [[WP:NOTREPOSITORY]]. "Wikipedia articles are not merely collections of Public domain or other source material... Complete copies of primary sources may go into Wikisource, but not on Wikipedia."

'''If the document is to be included, then how should it be included?'''
{{Commons|Category:Devyani Khobragade}}
#Post the images and links to the files within the text of the article, as shown in this RfC, so that people can get to the file page in one click. The two documents are posted in this RfC.
#Have a link in the external links section to all files on Wikimedia Commons / Wikisource categorized as related to the incident, so that people get to the file page in two clicks. <nowiki>{{Commons|Category:Devyani Khobragade}}</nowiki>
#Do not acknowledge the files on Wikimedia projects at all, but give an external link to [http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/January14/KhobragadeIndictment.php their hosting on the Department of Justice website]
#No, do not link to the documents at all from this article.

The current wording on this page says that if the Wikipedia article title is not ambiguous (such as [[Mercury (planet)]], [[Tree (set theory)]] or [[Solaris (film)]]), then the hatnotes to the disambiguation page should be removed ([[WP:NAMB]] for short). Several times we have had editors not otherwise involved with this page asking why these hatnotes were being removed. Earlier discussions on this led to nothing but a disclaimer that NAMB is disputed and shouldn't be the reason to remove hatnotes.

The question is this: '''Should we allow pages with unambiguous titles to include hatnotes to disambiguation pages?''' Some editors are opposed to this, calling it unnecessary clutter that isn't necessary. Other editors, such as me, consider it necessary for user who get to the wrong page through unpredictable search engine results. Also note that even supports of the current wording agreed that some should have it, such as [[Treaty of Paris]].

*<s>'''Include'''</s> means we should generally include these hatnotes on pages with non-ambiguous titles. I would recommend limiting it to a single link to the disambiguation page
*<s>'''don't include'''</s> means we should generally not include these hatnotes on pages with non-ambiguous titles

I've noticed several issues. First of all, there are two articles, [[First Austrian Republic]] (about Austrian state between 1919 and 1934) and [[Federal State of Austria]] (about Austrian state between 1934 and 1938). But, the talk page of the second article, ([[Talk:Federal State of Austria]]) redirects to the talk page of the first article!? And it is like that since 2012, as I can see in the article's history. The other problem I've noticed is that main infoboxes of both articles claim that Austria was a "Client state of Italy". The source of the information is cited in both articles as a book titled "Italy: a short history" by Harry Hearder and Jonathan Morris. This information was inserted into both articles by [[User:R-41]] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_State_of_Austria&diff=prev&oldid=424054601 in 2011] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_Austrian_Republic&diff=prev&oldid=516980847 2012]), who is under indefinite block since 1 June 2013. I am not expert in history, but this sounds as a joke to me. On the other hand, I can't believe that such an obvious vandalism was not noticed for almost three years!? Although I believe this to be vandalism, I do not have the cited book to verify the information, so I do not want to simply deleted it. I propose this "client state" information to be removed from both articles, and the [[Talk:Federal State of Austria]] to be edited, so not to be a redirect.

'''Criteria / Preamble'''

The [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/RfC for AfC reviewer permission criteria]] has been closed, and the closing editor, [[User:Mdann52|Mdann52]], indicated that the criteria for an editor to become an Afc reviewer would be
# having an account that was at least 90 days old, and 
#  having at least 500 undeleted edits.

Mdann52 also suggested that another RfC would be needed to work out the implementation details.

'''Rationale'''

There has been very little deliberate vandalism among Afc reviewers; most problems have been with good faith editors who either need experience with policies or who either haven't read or didn't understand the reviewing instructions.  

With the proposed process, 

# Any editor with the minimum time and experience can sign themselves up and then install the script, so admin time won't be taken up with handing out permissions and no WMF changes will be needed.  
# Exceptions can be made by an admin on request for an editor with a good reason (such as a new account for an experienced user, a long time IP user, someone migrating from another language Wikipedia, etc.)
# Only one gadget and a couple of instruction pages will need to be changed.
# The success of this approach depends on the good will of potential reviewers, since the list will not be protected.  However, in the past there has in general been good cooperation from new users when asked not to review; the problem has been to identify them before they have created too many problems. In any case we have 3RR to keep editors from repeatedly adding their names to the list.
# By keeping the tracking all inside Afc rather than asking WMF to create a new permission, if in the future Afc migrates to Draft or changes its processes, or even disappears altogether, there will be no residual effects outside the project.
# Inexperienced editors can still review manually, even though the instruction page would ask them not to, but we can always request a topic ban if this becomes a problem; no new procedures should be needed.
# If technically feasible, it would be beneficial to have the Afc Reviewer Script not function if the user's name was removed from the list after installation.

'''Proposal'''

# That a prominent notice be added to the list of Afc reviewers at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Participants]], inviting those who meet the two above criteria to add their usernames, and and requesting that editors who do not meet them to come back later.
# That if an editor does not meet the criteria but nonetheless is considered ready to review by any admin, the admin can add that editor's username to the list.
# That if an editor meets the criteria, but is banned from reviewing after a discussion closed by an admin, the banning admin can remove the editor's name from the list.
# That if an editor who does not meet the two criteria adds his or her own username to the list, any editor can remove it and refer the editor to the criteria.
# That the Afc Helper Script gadget installation process be modified so that, when invoked by a user who is not on the list, the script would not install, but instead present a message explaining that it is for the use of those whose names are on the list.
# That the Afc reviewer instruction page be modified by adding a message at the top directing new reviewers to the Participants page to sign up.

::''About that heading.... since someone complained I'd like to say that I was using "honest" as a synonym for "keeping it <ins>consistent</ins>".  Right now the consensus in the usage doc is to not use the tag to warn readers & not drive by tag as badge of shame.  The proposal to explicitly require the tagging ed to include a link to a specific thread is intended only to keep things consistent with that current consensus, and to tighten up the procedures for both tagging and reverting editors.  If consensus changes to "warn the reader" then all bets are off.''

I support careful editors with sincere concerns using the POV tag for its currently-stated purpose, which is to "attract editors" with different viewpoints to work thru issues on the talk page.
<p>
To further that goal I propose:
*(A) We explicitly ''require'' a talk page thread (instead of the implicit requirement we now seem to have)
*(B) We ''require'' use of the talk parameter to point to that thread (which is now optional, leaving other eds to guess which thread - if any - applies.)
<p>
These simple changes will preserve the function of the tag for genuine attempts to improve the project, while streamlining the elimination of disruptive tagging.  
<p>
<ins>Rationale for THREAD first, TAG second</ins>
*When a careful editor starts the thread, they then have the name of the thread to complete the talk parameter in the link
*When a careful editor tags first with no link, and the tag is reverted while the ed is starting the thread, the careful editor will know about the reversion and can simply retag with the link
*When a well-meaning editor tags but forgets to start the thread at all, they will still be alerted when the tag is reverted.
*When other eds see a tag with no link to a thread, they can revert the tag without fretting whether they have let the subjective "enough" time go by before concluding no thread will be forthcoming
*''THREAD first, TAG second'' protects all wannabe-diligent editors, both tagger and reverter, and will reduce instances when people argue whether a tag edit war has occurred.  In the remaining cases of tags with no links the tagging editor never intended to engage is serious talk page discussions anyway

<ins>Handling multiple threads</ins>
:(A) When the multiple threads are really sub-discussions of one basic issue, the talk page guidelines already encourage collecting the sub-discussions as sub-sections under a single main section heading, which is what should go in the talk parameter.
:(B) When the multiple threads are really different issues, eds should instead use the "multiple issues" template.
<p>
This is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3APOV%2Fdoc&diff=590798589&oldid=590587671 what those changes would look like].  Implementing this change would enhance our ability to purge bullshit tags.  Thoughts?

A "rather lively" and definitely "lengthy" debate has just taken place above, where approximately 3 editors strongly support the inclusion of a potentially "controversial fact" about Paul the apostle's teachings, in the article about him, and approximately 8 editors strongly oppose the inclusion of such material in the article.  This fact, is the fact that Jesus' teachings in the Bible are entirely silent on the question of the morality of homosexuality.  The claim has been made that by excluding this fact, the article becomes unnecessarily biased in the direction of traditionalism and orthodoxy, while others have claimed that the inclusion of the fact is a sort of a "double negative", since the absence of one thing does not necessarily prove the presence of another.  The fresh and unbiased opinions of others who do not necessarily edit in this article are welcomed here.  Thank you.

# Deprecation of the {{tlx|Indefblockedip}} template and updating of several policy pages to prohibit future indefinite blocks, which are variously located at [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy#IP address blocks]], [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy#Indefinite blocks]] and [[Wikipedia:Blocking IP addresses#Block lengths]].

As I have explained elsewhere on other wikis, my reasons for doing so are thus:
# IP addresses should never be indefinitely blocked as they can change hands pretty quickly.
# In the event that any single IP address does need an indefinite block, the Meta Stewards have already undertaken the necessary measures to solve that issue.

Please add your comments to the discussion below. Thanks! [[User:TeleComNasSprVen|TeleComNasSprVen]] ([[User talk:TeleComNasSprVen|talk]] &bull; [[Special:Contributions/TeleComNasSprVen|contribs]]) 20:47, 2 February 2014 (UTC)}}

===Original Map'''

Right now [[:File:Public opinion of same-sex marriage in USA by state.png]] is split into only four major categories:

{{legend|#00008b|Recent polls or ballot votes that show a majority of that state's population supports same-sex marriage.}}
{{legend|#318ce7|Recent polls that show less than a majority of that state's population opposes same-sex marriage.}}
{{legend|#ff0000|Recent polls or ballot votes that show a majority of that state's population opposes same-sex marriage.}}
{{legend|#DCDCDC|No recent poll data.}}

My question, is the wording "Recent polls that show less than a majority of that state's population opposes same-sex marriage." neutral? I see two shades of blue and only one shade of red so shouldn't there be "Recent polls that show less than a majority of that state's population supports same-sex marriage" as well? This is the first issue here per [[WP:UNDUE]].

The second issue is the actual polling data, according to [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States#By state]] each of the states in light blue have less than a 50% support rate for SSM so where is that line that defines "less than a majority"?

So my proposals are:

'''Proposal One'''

Proposal one: Based on the poll data from: [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States#By state]] make 4 categories. Most of the sources use the jargon "Split" or "Split on the issue".:

{{legend|#00008b|Recent polls or ballot votes that show a majority of that state's population supports same-sex marriage.}}
{{legend|#D754FF|Recent polls that are split on same-sex marriage.}} 
{{legend|#ff0000|Recent polls or ballot votes that show a majority of that state's population opposes same-sex marriage.}}
{{legend|#DCDCDC|No recent poll data.}}

'''Proposal Two'''

Proposal Two: Create 5 categories to balance things out.:

{{legend|#00008b|Recent polls or ballot votes that show a majority of that state's population supports same-sex marriage.}}
{{legend|#318ce7|Recent polls that show less than a majority of that state's population opposes same-sex marriage.}}
{{legend|#E4717A|Recent polls that show less than a majority of that state's population supports same-sex marriage.}}
{{legend|#ff0000|Recent polls or ballot votes that show a majority of that state's population opposes same-sex marriage.}}
{{legend|#DCDCDC|No recent poll data.}}

'''Opinions'''

In this section only please place *'''Support proposal 1''', *'''Proposal 1''', *'''Support proposal 2''', *'''Proposal 2''' or *'''Neither''' if you want to keep the map as status quo. 

*'''Support proposal 2''' with qualifications noted below.[[User:Bmclaughlin9|Bmclaughlin9]] ([[User talk:Bmclaughlin9|talk]]) 20:17, 18 January 2014 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Because this is a super-lightly trafficked article I'm submitting this to immediate RfC. I hope no one minds. In November I substantially rewrote this article (see above), which was essentially a bunch of thinly disguised vitriol against Benton. Two days later, an IP editor came along and swung it the other direction, turning it - essentially - into a fan club letter for Benton. I've just fixed all that. The news website Crosscut - prior to me fixing it - published an article "How to tell if your Senator edited his own Wikipedia entry." I've created a sub-section sourced to that article specifically to address the questions it raised, however, I'm concerned I may unfairly be using this as a scarlet letter and it is in violation of [[WP:CRITS]]. Further, since I was most directly impacted by the IP editors [[WP:PROMOTIONAL]] changes (as I had to manually undo them), it may not be entirely NPOV. Thirdly, this section contains some original research by me, namely that a IP editor edited it in November. Should this section exist? If not, can the content be incorporated elsewhere? Should it be deleted entirely? [[User:BlueSalix|BlueSalix]] ([[User talk:BlueSalix|talk]]) 03:57, 30 January 2014 (UTC)}}

In the electrical field, is the word "charge" a count noun, which should be treated as a plural whenever more than one electron is involved, or is it a mass noun (which refers to an indeterminate aggregation of things) and should be treated as singular even when more than one electron is involved?

'''Discussion of whether "count" is a count noun or mass noun'''

All the books I've ever read and all the professionals I've worked with treat "charge" as a mass noun in the electrical and electronics field of study.

{{rfcquote|text=
As seen in [[Talk:Comedian#Comedienne|the above section]], there is an ongoing edit war since at least 2008 between multiple users regarding whether the first sentence should mention the word 'comedienne'. A 'comedienne' is a female comedian, however, many comedians (including female comedians) don't like or use the word (they use 'comedian'). These are the two possible sentences (you can also propose another sentence if you'd like):

*'''A:''' A '''comedian''', also known as a '''comedienne''' (female) or '''comic''' (a professional comedian), is a person who seeks to [[entertain]] an audience, primarily by making them [[laughter|laugh]].
*'''B:''' A '''comedian''', also known as a '''comic''' (a professional comedian), is a person who seeks to [[entertain]] an audience, primarily by making them [[laughter|laugh]].

'''Support''' means that you want comedienne to be included (A); '''Oppose''' means that you ''don't'' want comedienne to be included (B).

Here is the current wording:

here is my suggested edit:
:: Media coverage of the centennial was declared "[[Dudley-Anderson-Yutzy#Clients_and_notable_campaigns|the public relations triumph of 1983]]" by ''[[Inc.]]''
My suggested revision adds a wikilink to another Wikipedia entry and also ends the sentence with one period. The other version (current) has two periods at the the end of the sentence and no wikilink. Another editor has expressed the opinion that the revised version would be promotional and is highly questionable as it may be an effort to promote the company to which the wikilink directs. I contend it would not be promotional as it is a wikilink to the orphaned article of a company that has been out of business since 1983 and that defunct businesses cannot benefit from promotion. Also that per WP:Orphan: ''it is therefore helpful to add links from other suitable pages with similar and/or related information. De-orphaning articles is an important aspect of building the web.'' Further, I believe there is nothing inherently promotional about ending a sentence with a single period but it is, rather, a question of good grammar.

The international standard [[ISO 8601]] describes the date format YYYY-MM-DD (for example, 20 May 1875 would be written 1875-05-20). The [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers]] allows this format in articles in situations where conciseness is important, and also recognizes the restriction contained in ISO 8601:
* that dates in the format must be [[Gregorian calendar]] dates, and 
* that the year must be at least 1583.
(See the table [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers&oldid=592413674#Date_formats here], left column, fifth row).

'''Should these restrictions be removed''', so that the format could also be used for Julian calendar dates (for example the birth date of [[Gregory XII]] could be written 1503-01-07)?

I kind of have an idea though, and it's very rough right now. So I'm very eager to start that."[23] Sean Garrett spoke on the album's sound saying it was "a great mish-mash of genres".[24] A review in Vibe magazine stated: "In the usual, sometimes vexing, Rihanna way, she achieves all this using a grab bag of genres, including '90s R&B ... dub step, pop and a token Irie jam."[25] According to The Guardian: "Her seventh album in seven years is all filthy lyrics and crashing dubstep drops: R&B-pop turned up to 11."[26] Rihanna revealed during an interview with GQ’s “Men of the Year” that she wanted her music to be uplifting saying “I want to make music that’s hopeful, uplifting. Nothing corny or supersentimental. I just want it to have the feeling that brings you out of whatever you’re going through. I want it to spark that fire. I want it to be real, authentic, and raw.”[27][28]''

The article in general still seems to read something like an advert for synthetic phonics: it seems like someone has copy pasted 'A Guide to Synthetic phonics' (and not a totally neutral guide, though I recognise that it's not far off, and suspect that this is to do with the wiki magic of past edits over time) or somesuch. Some of the bits that most jumped out at me were the layout: 'What it is' and 'What it is not' seem to read more like a myth-busting leaflet than an encyclopedia; it seems to me that the 'Common terminology' is again not the kind of section that Wikipedia encourages; and I thought that when discussing phonemes it was Wikipedia standard to use IPA rather than approximations.

I've not been able to find any guidelines to support me on these matters, so although I am happy to try and make the edits that I have suggested, I do not wish to do so until I've got a second opinion agreeing with me on these matters.

{{rfcquote|text=
Are the Aleut and/or Alutiq peoples Eskimos?  This is obviously a complex issue.  They are considered different in many literature sources.  There are two problems with this, however.  First, it is undisputed that the Eastern Aleuts (Alutiq) are closely related both genetically and linguistically to the Southern Yupik. Studies have been done proving Western Aleut similar in genetics (too lazy to bring them up at the moment, sorry) to both the Siberian and Alaskan Yupik peoples.  On the other hand it is pretty well undisputed the the Western Aleut culture is very far different from pretty much all other peoples except (to my knowledge), ironically, the Eastern Aleuts.  
It's pretty clear then, that the Western Aleuts require at the least their own very distinct subheading under the umbrella term Eskimo.  However there is no question that they are more closely related to the Eskimo in culture and language than to any other group, and importantly that they clearly belong to no other large group.  Further ambiguity is pressed upon this issue when you consider that "eskimo" itself is already a very broad term.  Probably, due to the abundance of literature assuming (if not proving) otherwise, it is unlikely that the term "Aleut" will ever really fall completely under the "eskimo umbrella."  And the Eastern Aleut (Alutiq) people will probably be forever both (incorrectly) assumed (Unangan)Aleuts and (incorrectly) assumed Yupik.  Yet both groups deserve not only more specificity but also generally more support/respect from this article.  Both are among the most continually marginalized of all modern indigenous peoples of the world, and are known to most of the world only under the term Eskimo, and yet the opening statements of the Wikipedia article on "Eskimo" essentially avoids mention of their existence, and even states (without source, at the moment) that they are "not included in the Eskimo designation."  This statement is actually sort of true, but whether the lack of designation is justifiable is another matter, and something probably needs to be said to achieve balance in this regard.  The Sirenik Eskimos are named Eskimos, although in some ways (as reported in the article) they are arguably more distinct from Eskimo and Unangan peoples than the latter groups are from each other.  As for the Alutiq, they (sorry could not find the source wherein I read that) generally consider it offensive to be considered Yupik.  In any case they are a distinct people, coming from a distint (warmer) climate and geography, and most importantly they do not typically refer to themselves as Yupik.  "Aleut" is in fact a very common self-referential for these people [see: https://alutiiqmuseum.org/files/Ed%20Handouts/2%20WhoAreAlutiiqs.pdf], and Yupik is definitely not, in spite of the anthropological merit of the latter classification.

During a deletion discussion i have been advised that templates can overrule the need for a category. The example from that discussion would be does [[:Template:TonyAward Musical 2001–2025]], supersede the need for a cat, such as Tony award winning best musicals. If templates do or can supersede the need for a cat then its possible and likely that a number of cats will be nominated for deletion and this would effect numerous projects. I would appreciate further discussion on whether cats and templates run concurrently and serve different or exclusive purposes or whether one overrules the other.

A bitter dispute has arisen in the preceding talk sections over the hypothesis found in numerous books written by scholars of cannabis botany, Ancient Near East experts, including Universities, etc. etc., suggesting that the ingredient identified in Hebrew as ''keneh bosm'' in fact was not calamus, but rather cannabis.  It seems a faction of a few editors is so convinced that this hypothesis is incorrect and that the calamus hypothesis is the correct one, that they seek to use WP:FRINGE to have the article endorse only the calamus hypothesis. I disagree with them because to me this approach seems one-sided and antagonistic to NPOV.

There's quite a high amount of vandalism on the article feedback pages. Most of these are from anonymous editors who have little or no other contributions. Most of them never seem to get admonished or warned on their talk pages. Is there anything we could be doing to reduce the apathetic attitude towards this? Perhaps linking article feedback to user contributions instead of just logging it would be a good help? Alternatively, we could make contributions designated "inappropriate" visible to everyone through a specific url; instead of just monitors.

In a recent attempt to promote the article to [[WP:FA]], it [[Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Rape_and_pregnancy_controversies_in_United_States_elections,_2012/archive3|was suggested]] that the was [[WP:Coatrack]]. The article does go into many comments that would not be [[WP:notable]], if not for the comments by Akin and Murdock.  However, with that statement, the Akin and Murdock comments remain note worthy.  Not only did they tip two Senate races, but it is still part of the political discussion in the United States.  A google news search of "legitimate rape", demonstrates that fact. That said, what would be the thoughts of changing the article to only discuss Akin's and Mourdock's comments and any wider impact.  Moreover, one could rename the article.  Perhaps, [[Rape comments in United States Senate elections, 2012]].  That title would narrow the focus of the article and perhaps move the article passed criticisms concerning [[WP:Coatrack]].  At that point, the article could perhaps make it to [[WP:FA]].  Thoughts?  Thanks in advance. [[User:Casprings|Casprings]] ([[User talk:Casprings|talk]]) 20:52, 2 February 2014 (UTC)}}

Perhaps something like: "Similarly, avoid describing a viewpoint as a "conspiracy theory", as this term tends to have a subjective and potentially prejudicial aspect as well as a more neutral meaning.

* Currently the article states Yelp is an "online urban guide". I believe this metaphorical language should be avoided.
* [[user:Candleabracadabra]] believes it should be described as "local search" (Candle please correct if I am mis-stating)
* [[user:Wikidemon]] says that Yelp is a lot of different things (search, listings, reviews, etc.) (again, Wikidemon correct me if I am mis-stating).
* The way Yelp describes itself is something like it "connects people with local businesses" which IMO is a good umbrella conceptualizing, but unusable as promotional (focuses on benefits/outcomes of use rather than what it is)

There has also been some debate on whether it should be called an "American company" being that it is headquartered in the US, but has international operations in many countries. 

I have a COI. Would like to bring the article up to GA, but I think there are some disputed areas that we'll need to take slowly and get more editors involved to see where things head. 

My approach would be something like "Yelp, Inc is a multinational corporation headquartered in [[San Francisco, California]], which operates the crowd-sourced, [[Local search (Internet)|local business search]], review and listings service also called Yelp.

Appreciate your input in advance. Since it is inappropriate for me to edit boldly, I would appreciate if a bold editor was willing to assess consensus of the RFC and make appropriate edits as they deem fit.

I'm wondering if we may want to remove any sourcing that is attributed to [[Ergun Caner]]. There is a huge controversy right now considering his claims of Muslim Upbringing (there have been several demonstrated lies on his part regarding his Islamic heritage and background knowledge), and many people are pointing out substantial errors that he makes regarding basics of Islamic studies. If this doesn't outright discredit him as any sort of authority on Islam, it certainly calls his status as a [[WP:RS]] into question.

Some of his errors:
* Caner does not know the difference between Islam's article of faith and the first chapter of the Qur'an
* He's claimed that the lunar month of Ramadan lasts for 40 days.
* In his book, he writes that he performed all of the rakats (daily prayers). The actual word is salah.

Some of the lies he has propogated:
* He's claimed to have debated Muslim scholars who've never heard of him.'
* Court records from his parent's divorce indicate that he was in Ohio when he was a young child, long before his alleged move from Turkey.
* On his books, his middle name is Mehmet (Muhammad in Turkish), yet it is listed as Michael on his concealed-weapons permit in Virginia. Before 9/11, he went by E. Michael Caner.
* In one speech, Caner told a crowd that outside the mosque in Kabul there was a sign that read, "Do not teach the women to read and write." The story may or may not be true, but Caner, to give authority to the tale, told the crowd what was written in the native tongue: "bahasha uwtara muwtara seeteeroh." That's neither Dari nor Arabic nor Urdu nor Turkish nor Pashtu. It is an entirely made up language.

I was recently the uninvolved closer for a [[WP:ANRFC]] request regarding the television show "NUMB3RS" and if the title of our article should be "Numb3rs", "NUMB3RS", or "Numbers (TV series)". MOS is a guideline. RS is a policy. There are split decisions all over the wiki for following MOS vs RS/Primary.  I have no personal horse in this race, but I think this is something that should probably be given a closer look by the wider community to see if the conflict between the two directions can be resolved. Making things slightly more complicated, in  light of the Manning controversy, MOS appears to be given weight above its status as a guideline.

'''Question 1''' Does MOS or RS take priority for determining article titles. 
'''Question 2''' When evaluating sources, what weight are given to sources such as the [[WP:PRIMARY]] show/album/company itself, IMDB, TvGuide, AllMusic, Amazon etc.

A few examples of articles where the conflict has either been discussed locally, or just to show the various outcomes

Is this an  information page or is it an essay? This has been discussed before, and in a recent edit it was claimed that there is was consensus two years ago, but looking at the history it is not at all clear to me that there was a consensus at that time. A recently created essay [[Wikipedia:Don't cite WP42 at AfD]] argues that this is not an information page and does not "describes communal consensus on some aspect of Wikipedia norms and practices", claiming that it has consistently failed to be an accurate description of the notability guidelines, representing then as being stricter and more unequivocal than they really are. In my opinion, that is a correct assessment, and this page should be tagged as the essay that it is.

'''Survey: Information Page'''

#'''Weak Support'''- its explanations of the verifiability and notability requirements are completely correct. But the page would need to be edited to be less like a klaxon screaming in your face.

I really hate bundled AfDs since they always seem to have problems, but this was the only rational course with so many pages. In any event the AfD was created but so far has not not appeared in the AfD roster for Feb 9 2014. Nor has it been noticed by any of the bots that tag it for various categories. Consequently it seems to be mainly attracting comments from those who were already watching the articles in question. I am hoping to get some outside input in the discussion since it does involve a rather large number of related articles.

 Should Chinese dynasties be capitalized as "Foo Dynasty" or "Foo dynasty"? 

The [[WP:History_standards_for_China-related_articles#Dynasties | guideline currently states]] that Chinese dynasties, "should always be <nowiki>[[(Name of Dynasty) Dynasty]]</nowiki>." For example, [[Han Dynasty]], [[Tang Dynasty]], etc. This proposal would change the clause to read "<nowiki>[[(Name of dynasty) dynasty]]</nowiki>." The various dynasty articles could then be retitled as "Han dynasty," "Tang dynasty," etc. This is clearly the more common usage, although not by an overwhelming margin, as you can see [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Han+Dynasty+%2B+Tang+Dynasty%2CTang+dynasty+%2B+Han+dynasty&year_start=1990&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2C%28Han%20Dynasty%20%2B%20Tang%20Dynasty%29%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C%28Tang%20dynasty%20%2B%20Han%20dynasty%29%3B%2Cc0 here]. ''Britannica'' gives these dynasties lower cased  [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253872/Han-dynasty here] and [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/582301/Tang-dynasty here]. The ''[http://www.amazon.com/Chicago-Manual-Style-16th/dp/0226104206/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie= Chicago Manual of Style]'' gives the examples "Qing dynasty," "Ming dynasty," and "Shang dynasty." The manual explains that the word "dynasty" should be lower cased because it is, "considered an era rather than a political division" (Section 8.71). CMOS is the most widely used style guide and is cited or recommended in the [[WP:Mos#Further_reading | MOS]] in several places. For non-Asian dynasties, the convention of lower casing is well established, as you can see from [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Tudor+dynasty+%2B+Romanov+dynasty%2CTudor+Dynasty+%2B+Romanov+Dynasty&year_start=1990&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2C%28Tudor%20dynasty%20%2B%20Romanov%20dynasty%29%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C%28Tudor%20Dynasty%20%2B%20Romanov%20Dynasty%29%3B%2Cc0 this ngram].

Proposal: The number of examples provided for each child actor should be limited to five, and this should be clarified in the lead.  I propose language to the effect of: 
: "This is a '''list of former child actors from the United States'''. These actors were aged 17 or younger at the time they started acting but are currently 18 or over. The list also includes child actors now deceased. Movies and/or TV series in which an actor appears are mentioned only if the actor was still a child at the time of filming. List is not intended to chronicle the actor's entire career, so examples of their works should be limited to five."

Rationale: Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate list. Wikipedia is not IMDb. The focus of the article are the actors, not their works.

In 2013 [[Mia Farrow]] claimed she had an extramarital affair with a 73 year-old [[Frank Sinatra]], while he was married to [[Barbara Sinatra]], and that this affair "possibly" produced Ronan Farrow, the subject of this article, who - up to that point - had been assumed to have been the child of [[Woody Allen]]. No DNA testing has been done on Ronan Farrow to determine the validity of Mia Farrow's claims of an extramarital sex affair. [[Barbara Sinatra]] has rejected Mia Farrow's implication that she (Barbara) was in an adulterous relationship saying ''"It’s just a bunch of junk. There’s always junk written — lies that aren’t true."'' [[http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/10/frank-sinatras-widow-calls-ronan-farrow-paternity-report-phony/]] If you support ''including'' Barbara Sinatra's rejection as to the validity of Mia Farrow's claim about the fidelity of Barbara's husband, indicate below with '''support'''. If you support excluding Barbara Sinatra's response to Mia Farrow's claim, indicate below with '''oppose'''. A separate section has been created for longer '''discussion'''. 

'''EDIT (Feb. 17, 2014):''' By editor ([[User:5Q5]]) request, I am including specific text for consideration in this discussion (I'm very open to discussing edits to the below, I just wanted to get something on the page so we have a more concrete plan of action - please provide comments and suggested amendments in the Discussion section). Most of this is already contained in the article, I have just recopied it here for convenience of context - additions have been highlighted and deletions are stricken (on further review, the, stricken information is sourced to tabloid magazines like ''US Weekly'').
:<s>Farrow is estranged from his father, Woody Allen. In 2011 he commented, "He's my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression." On June 12, 2012, he tweeted, "Happy Father's Day — or as they call it in my family, happy brother-in-law's day."</s> ''Farrow's parentage has been the source of some confusion.'' Asked about longstanding speculation that Ronan Farrow is the son of Mia Farrow's ex-husband Frank Sinatra, Mia Farrow claimed in a 2013 ''[[Vanity Fair]]'' article that Sinatra might "possibly" be Ronan's father. After the allegation became widespread in the news media, Ronan Farrow tweeted humorously on October 2, 2013, "Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son." ''In a statement released by his publicist, Allen originally rejected the suggestion as “fictitious and extravagantly absurd,” however, in a subsequent'' ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial posed the question “is he my son or, as Mia suggests, Frank Sinatra’s?” ''Barbara Sinatra, Frank Sinatra’s wife at the time Mia Farrow suggested she engaged in a sexual relationship with the singer, has dismissed the idea as “lies” and “a bunch of junk.”''

''' Support '''

* '''Support''' Claims of spousal infidelity are of a serious nature and the effected party includes both parts of the conjugal couple; to exclude Barbara Sinatra's informed opinion (as Frank Sinatra's wife) that her husband had been cheating on her would lead a person reading this article to assume this was simply an accepted fact as opposed to a disputed or unresolved historical episode. Wikipedia is about maximizing access to information; there needs to be an extremely compelling case as to why we should obfuscate or conceal knowledge and it hasn't been met, IMO. Barbara Sinatra is not a man-on-the-street but, in fact, one-half of the conjugal couple Mia Farrow claims suffered marital infidelity. Barbara's rejection of Mia's claim should be knowledge that is available to our readers. [[User:BlueSalix|BlueSalix]] ([[User talk:BlueSalix|talk]]) 20:51, 12 February 2014 (UTC)}}

The justification given to support this is that capitals would be useful to avoid possible confusion is some cases (e.g. Common Starling). One can understand these concerns, but capitals are not needed to avoid potential misunderstandings: anybody can use direct links to Wikipedia articles to make everything clear (e.g. [[common starling]] avoid any potential uncertainty).
More importantly, the guidelines regarding titles of articles about fauna species recommends not to use capital letters in species names ([[WP:FAUNA]], "Articles whose titles are the common (vernacular) names of animals are normally titled in sentence case—for example, Przewalski's horse, Black bear.

This article seems to be a duplicate of the Euromaiden article and does not provide much information that could not be covered in that article. Secondly, this article's title is controversial given the unrest in Ukraine, and other issues. For many ethnic Ukrainians, they consider it a revolution in their interests, while for many ethnic Russians living in Ukraine they consider it a [[coup d'etat]] against their interests, and as such there has been unrest by the ethnic Russian population. Neutrality needs to be upheld, and I believe that the Euromaiden article can address much of the material there.
I suggest that a second article could possibly be created that is titled: [[Ouster of Victor Yanukovych]], that would focus on the process that saw him rejected by the Ukrainian parliament and subsequently fleeing Ukraine to Russia.--[[Special:Contributions/74.12.195.248|74.12.195.248]] ([[User talk:74.12.195.248|talk]]) 03:15, 17 March 2014 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
File:Samesex marriage in USA.svg used a medium blue color to denote states that offer civil unions (CU) or domestic partnerships (DP) that off all (or nearly all) the state-level rights of marriage and a medium colored red to represent states that have constitutional bans of same-sex marriage (SSM) (but not CU/DPs). Representing laws on both SSM and CU/DPs is within the scope of this map and has been for many years. Currently, there are three states striped with this medium blue and this medium red. It has been suggested by one or more users that no more states will legalize CU/DPs in the future, and thus medium blue should be redefined to mean ''"Civil unions granting privileges similar to marriage for same-sex domestic partners '''BUT''' Constitution bans same-sex civil marriage"''. CU/DPs are reguarly considered pro-LGBT (postive) laws on this map and thus are blue; constitutional amendments banning SSM are considered anti-LGBT (laws) and thus are red. Is it proper to merge these two classes of laws into one positive (blue) color, or is that non-neutral. Discussions on this matter can also be seen [[File_talk:Samesex_marriage_in_USA.svg#Proposal_1_.28Mark_Nevada.2C_Colorado.2C_and_Oregon_medium_blue.29|above]] and [[File_talk:Samesex_marriage_in_USA.svg#Texas|farther above]].

{{rfcquote|text=
The new article [[Skaramuca]] sounds like a copy of some of the typical Serbian nationalist forum posts - a glaring [[WP:COATRACK]] violation which focuses on a purported Serbian nature of a surname and people, who today by and large seem to be Croatian. Specifically, the whole innuendo depends on [[Jevto Dedijer]]'s 1909 book. Can this source be considered reliable for claims such as these? Given the confusingly wide scope of the article, talking about people having the same surname over a period of centuries (?) up to the present day, this could even be considered a [[WP:BLP]] violation.

(I initially posted this to [[WP:RSN]], but sadly I got no response. Let's try it like this.)

'''What terminology should be used to describe the sport variously known as football, soccer or Association football, within the Australian context on Wikipedia?'''

Main arguments used in previous discussions:

#[[Talk:Soccer in Australia/Archive 3]] in August 2013 strongly endorsed keeping the main article at [[Soccer in Australia]]. 
#The point has also been made that there is [[Barassi Line|regional variation]] in the terminology used to describe [[the Beautiful Game]] in the Australian context.
#The Australian association renamed itself [[Football Federation Australia]] in 2004.[http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/football-in-australia]
#"Football" is highly ambiguous in this context as there also exist [[American football]], [[Gaelic football]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], and [[Australian rules football]], all of which could also be referred to as "football".
#"[[Association football]]" (as used on Wikipedia's main article on the sport) is not a common name in everyday parlance anywhere.
#"Soccer", while thoroughly unambiguous, seems to strongly offend some editors in some contexts.

'''Questions'''
#'''Can we agree to postpone further discussion of the title of the article [[Soccer in Australia]] until after 31 August 2015?''' It seems unlikely that any new arguments will be made, but obviously if there were genuine new data before Aug 2015 we could agree to bring this forwards. Saying '''"Yes"''' to this will allow editors to get on with more useful endeavours, pending the emergence of genuinely new data, and prevent AN/I from being continually clogged up with this dispute.
#Is it perhaps unrealistic and unhelpful given the regional variation in terminology of this sport to try at this stage to homogenise the nomenclature on all articles which discuss the sport in the Australian context? '''Can we agree to allow the current inconsistency to persist in the interest of editor harmony and reader experience, given that there is no suggestion that using 'soccer' or 'association football' will seriously mislead or confuse anybody?''' Saying '''"Yes"''' will allow editors to debate proper terminology on an article-by-article basis without worrying about anybody making sweeping changes and using the August RfC as a justification.

'''Format'''

Because this has already been the subject of extensive discussion at my talk page and various other locations, I would like to keep it succinct here. I also propose to run this for only 14 days (unless there are objections or insufficient interest), so I would propose closing on or after 20 March 2014. --[[User:John|John]] ([[User talk:John|talk]]) 20:20, 6 March 2014 (UTC)}}

; Background
: On {{Diff|Talk:India|597380690|597302051|27 February 2014, it was requested}} that {{Tl|Largest cities of India}} be added to [[India]] of which I declined due to a concerns that the navigational template has a citation.
: I started a discussion about my specific concerns on [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2014 February 27#Template:Largest cities of India]] where I stated my concern and asked some questions:
::  This template includes a [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|citation]], and as such is required to go above any <code><references /></code> or {{Tl|Reflist}} section. This template is also what is considered a [[wikipedia:Navigation templates|navigational box]] which is required to sit at the very bottom of articles below any <code><references /></code> or {{Tl|Reflist}} section. As such, this is a contradiction in of itself and any placement of this template will require consensus.
:* Is there consensus to allow this [[Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates|NAVBOX]] to go into the context of the article?
:* Should (can) the included citation be removed or otherwise presented so that this [[Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates|NAVBOX]] does not need to go into the context of the article?
:* Should all of the navigational properties of the template be removed so that it is no longer a [[Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates|NAVBOX]]?
:* Should this [[Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates|NAVBOX]] simply be deleted?
: During the discussion on that page, it was brought to my attention that {{Tl|Largest cities in Turkey}} has this same problem, and potentially all of the templates in [[:Category:City population templates]] could have this problem, so I asked the contributors there if this was worth taking to a larger venue for more in depth discussion and figuring out what the appropriate course of action for these templates should be.  The response was that [[WP:TfD|TfD]] is an inadequate venue.
: [[WP:TL;DR|TL;DR]] version: Are {{Tl|Largest cities}} templates actually [[Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates|NAVBOXes]], and if they are, should they be required to use raw citations (so that <code><references /></code> or {{Tl|Reflist}} isn't required below them)? — <span class="nowrap">&#123;&#123;U&#124;[[User:Technical 13|Technical 13]]&#125;&#125;</span> <sup>([[User talk:Technical 13|t]] • [[Special:EmailUser/Technical 13|e]] • [[Special:Contribs/Technical 13|c]])</sup> 15:31, 6 March 2014 (UTC)}}

Of course there are exceptions. Per [[WP:TOC]], "Although usually a heading after the TOC is preferable, <nowiki>__TOC__</nowiki> can be used to avoid being forced to insert a meaningless heading just to position the TOC correctly, i.e., not too low." That's a direct quote. Yes, Point #2 in "Floating the TOC" says "If floating the TOC, it should be placed at the end of the lead section of the text, before the first section heading." but Point #5 says "The default TOC is placed before the first headline, but after any introductory text (unless changed by the page's editors). If the introductory summary is long enough that a typical user has to scroll down to see the top of the TOC, you may float the TOC so it appears closer to the top of the article. However, the floating TOC should in most cases follow at least the first paragraph of article text." This is an explicit exception, and blind reversion is uncalled for. - [[User:Dravecky|Dravecky]] ([[User talk:Dravecky|talk]]) 09:26, 19 February 2014 (UTC)}}

When a record was not issued in a picture sleeve, many articles use a photo of the record label instead.  Is this something that is allowed under our NFCC policies?  Some editors seem to suggest that a label is not acceptable, so I am looking for clarification. Can we assume that an image of a label is just as valid as an image of a sleeve, under "fair use"?

A few examples of pages that use record labels:
*[[From Me to You]] - the Beatles
*[[Please Please Me (song)]] - the Beatles
*[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)#Rolling Stones version]]
*[[I Wanna Be Your Man#The Rolling Stones.27 version]]
*[[Little Red Rooster]] - Rolling Stones

I wondered whether we should have a bit of brain-storming session as to whether we can improve TFA and TFAR and if so how.  So far in 2014 the figures are staying the same as they did for 2013 - I'm having to choose 55% of articles because the community only nominates articles for 45% of the slots.  The page was very active recently for a certain nomination, of course, but that didn't lead to people thinking "and while I'm here, I'll nominate X for TFA".  Things that I have tried so far include increasing the date range for [[WP:TFARP]] to 1 year (from 3 months) and leaving messages regularly for editors with newly promoted TFAs, informing/reminding them about TFAR.  The former has had little effect so far; the latter sometimes gets people to nominate but not often. At present, for instance, we have three nominations on the requests page when there are fourteen slots available.

Is the problem with TFAR? Or is the problem with TFA? There are I know certain brave people who are happy to have their articles on the main page and who will even nominate them.  There are others who would rather run a mile (or make me run a mile, preferably) than have to go through the TFA experience. What are the issues? Is there anything that can be done?

Pinging various people who have had an article promoted to FA in 2013/14 or who have been commenting here recently (I have removed the long list of pingees) - at 300+ people, that might set the ball rolling!

This tag hasn't been given the same amount of attention as [[Template:POV]], although the complications that may be associated with them are similar. I noticed a problem here (which I assume can be considered a topic that's sensitive enough for this issue to be a serious one):

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jasenovac_concentration_camp&oldid=594810873

Basically, the tag risks creating a situation where the whole topic somehow is unduly discredited. The tag should be a less serious variant than [[Template:Unreferenced]] and [[Template:Disputed]], but the current "Some or all [...]" phrasing doesn't make it so.

Therefore, I suggest the following:

* Rephrase the first sentence so that it doesn't risk creating excessive "collateral damage" by discrediting reliable data
* Introduce a set of usage notes based on the ones found in [[Template:POV]] (and maybe something from other template docs?)
* (other suggestions?)

In its current form this article fails [[WP:NPOV]] as it bares the name "Supreme Council" while its ''de facto'' name is "State Council of Crimea". However, I find it unnecessary to create two articles of the same thing as the only difference between the Supreme Council and the State Council is its name and their disputed authority. I, therefore, believe that what's best for Wikipedia is to keep a single centralized article named "Crimean Parliament" that does not take any sides, remains neutral and impartial, and explains the situation at hand while retaining the entity's history and structure in one single place.

{{rfcquote|text=
Recently [[Wikipedia_talk:AFC#Dates_of_birth_and_death|a discussion]] was had at the AFC wiki project talk page about adding the following categories to newly promoted biographies from AFC space if it was appropriate.
* [[:Category:Date of birth missing]]
* [[:Category:Date of birth missing (living people)]]
* [[:Category:Date of death missing]]
* [[:Category:Date of birth unknown]]
* [[:Category:Place of birth missing]]
* [[:Category:Place of death missing]]

There was a sidebar discussion about what to do about the numerous BLPs that are already in main space that may have these parameters not fully asserted.  Therefore I would like to evalute the consensus on the following question

''Is there consensus to have a bot task to scan all biographies in main space on a semi-frequent basis and based off an implementation, to add the appropriate maintenance categories to the page?''

This RFC is not the implementation or requirements gathering for the task, it is only to ask the question "Should we do this task?".  This is the first RFC in a proposed chain of RFCs to establish consensus for such a task and then to design the requirements for the task (should the first part pass)

'''Yes'''

Let me be the first to comment. First, fair and open disclosure: I am not exactly a neutral editor. I have had numerous run-ins with Ron Torossian's minions, on this talk page and on my own talk page, including receiving a threat of a lawsuit for referring in a post to the size of the subject's nose.

That said, I see nothing wrong with including a reference to Torossian's new luxury real estate purchase. On the contrary, I think it adds an aspect of tawdry ostentation to the portrait.

Of course, the libel suit is relevant, well-sourced, and should also stay. --[[User:Ravpapa|Ravpapa]] ([[User talk:Ravpapa|talk]]) 14:46, 21 February 2014 (UTC)}}

This one has been controversial in its inclusion, as it does refer to events that happened explicitly to gay men, but it isn't '''for''' their gender that they were killed, but for their sexuality. There is currently no Wikipedia definition for 'Violence against men', but the 'Violence against women' article states "VAW... is gender-based, meaning that the acts of violence committed against women expressly because they are women, or as a result of patriarchal gender constructs." Changing 'women' for 'men in this paragraph, does the article qualify for inclusion? These men weren't killed "expressly because they are men", but there is an argument that patriarchal gender constructs caused this homophobic violence, as men are pressured to act a certain way within sexist societies. I would go further to say that, with the reference to their dress as emo, they were persecuted for dressing femininely, which would reinforce the patriarchal argument further. The question is, does the article qualify for inclusion in 'Violence against men', or is the category 'Homophobic violence' enough? --[[User:Drowninginlimbo|Drowninginlimbo]] ([[User talk:Drowninginlimbo|talk]]) 18:30, 17 March 2014 (UTC)}}

Below is the selection criteria (see '''[[WP:LSC]]''') for the list of pogroms in this article. This criteria is originally from the article [[List of events named pogrom]] which has now been merged here.

{|class="messagebox"
|
<small><u>'''Article summary''':</u><br>
This is a list of events for which one of the commonly accepted names includes the word "pogrom".
<br>
<u>'''Edit box summary (does not show in article)''':</u><br>
;Inclusion criteria (equivalent to that at the article [[List of events named massacres]]).
#Inclusion in this list is based ''solely'' on evidence in multiple [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] that a name including the word "pogrom" is one of the accepted names for that event. A reliable source that merely describes the event as ''being'' a pogrom does not qualify the event for inclusion in this list. The word Pogrom must appear in the source as part of a ''name'' for the event.
#Where there is dispute over this, discussion should be [[WP:MULTI|centralized]]. If it is discussed on the talk page of the article concerned, a link should be posted on the talk page of this list; if the discussion is on the talk page of this list, a link should be posted at the article's talk page.
;Notes
#Any name for the event which is established by use of [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] as being one of the accepted terms would usually also be included in the article on that event.
#Inclusion in this list does not ''of itself'' justify inclusion in the article, and nor does use of the name in an article justify inclusion in this list, because Wikipedia is not a [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable source]]. Both uses must be based directly on explicit references to the sources, which should be cited in footnotes. However, it is hard to envisage any situation where a name including "pogrom" could be included in this list but not mentioned in an article on the event (or vice versa); if that situation should arise, both the uses should be carefully examined.

Attempts have been made to add content to the article relating to the role of anti-cultists in the media leading up to the siege. Prominent Scholars and writers on the subject have agreed that the Cult Awareness network as well as affiliated notable anti-cultists such as [[Rick_Ross_(consultant)|Rick Ross]] and others played a crucial and deciding role in authorities' decision to raid the compound. 

The material is referenced, attributed and is within the scope of the article.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waco_siege&diff=595231397&oldid=595201545 my original content] was criticised as being too long and focused on an individual - Rick Ross, so I changed the content to include information about other anti-cultists and prominent [[Cult Awareness Network|CAN]] spokespeople (CAN was the largest anti-cult group at the time) - Rick Ross and others from the organization were featured prominently in the media preceding and after the raid.

My content was removed by [[User:Niemti]] "hugevcontent fork".
and again. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waco_siege&diff=next&oldid=595267427 "no."]
and once more. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waco_siege&diff=next&oldid=595267965 "if you want to randomly copy-paste over 5 kb of unedited (even link to this article remains) content from someone's biography article, making him much more discussed here than everyone else including Koresh, don't."]

At this stage I decided to take it to the discussion page, where  [[User:Niemti]] explained why they had removed the content: "Unrevelantly random (a whole lot of stupid crap about what some guy allegedly did or said during the siege but placed into the section discussing the events that led to the ADF raid), undue weight, distracting, unedited copypasta"

:Another user [[User:Enric Naval]] was more helpful, noting: "It gives lots and lots of attention to Rick Ross. It unbalances the article. It also places a lot of blame exclusively on Rick Ross, what about the other advisors and experts?"

:[[User:Niteshift36]] wrote "You haven't demonstrated the relevance".

I took these two helpful evaluations, and added new material, removed the undue weight placed on Rick Ross, and added attributed references to demonstrate relevance, including references and quotes by authors writing about how anti-cultists and CAN  played an important "crucial" role in the events that unfolded. This is using references by cardinal writers on the topics of cults and religion as well as on the siege itself, and includes a report to the department of Justice. Still, the material was removed.

    1. The material is factual (everything is referenced using reliable high quality sources)
    2. It is within the scope of the article and the section - relevant, describes events leading up to the raid
    3. It is written in a neutral fashion.

No effort was made by other editors to make changes to the material; it was simply removed from the page without any real reason given. When another editor [[User:Woodshed|Woodshed]] commented above, he was aggressively and personally attacked. 

I had requested a [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation/Waco_siege|request for mediation]] -but the editors in question refused to participate. Since there appears to be no way forward I am requesting outside input so consensus can be formed. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Zambelo|Zambelo]]</span>; [[User talk:Zambelo|talk]]</span> 00:57, 24 February 2014 (UTC)}}

How can anyone seriously deny, based on the sources in the article, that the article is about discrimination, even if there is no discrimination for it to be about?  Thus the suggested guideline for template inclusion in the '''essay''' [[WP:NAV]] is satisfied: {{xt|If the articles are not established as related by reliable sources in the actual articles, then it is probably not a good idea to interlink them.}}  Actually, now that I think of it, the converse of that statement is satisfied, as there '''are''' reliable sources in the article that establish the relationship.  It's just an essay, though, so I suppose we can assume that the statement is meant as an if and only if rather than an implication.&mdash; [[User:Alf.laylah.wa.laylah|alf laylah wa laylah]] ([[User_talk:Alf.laylah.wa.laylah|talk]]) 01:34, 25 February 2014 (UTC)}}

After investigating some of the supplied links, I am now even more suspicious that the editor reverting my edits and accusing me of vandalism is Zak Smith himself. He seems to have participated in a flame war on a forum recently and may be sensitive to such things as a notability question of the wikipedia article about him. I will make no outright accusations without some proof but if it is Zak Smith, his editing and defense of his own page seems like it would be a conflict of interest.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should the article on Windows XP discuss options for dealing with the ending of support?

This discussion would benefit from brief comments from non-specialist editors (though of course more thorough consideration would be very welcome).

''' Proposals '''

''' Methodology '''

Taking the advice of [[user:Guy Macon|Guy Macon]] and [[user:Elizium23|Elizium23]], I researched this topic by googling &lt;what to do when xp support ends&gt;.

To avoid bias I selected the first 6 answers which talked about options (rejecting microsoft.com as likely to be partisan) which gave the following sources:
* [[PC Advisor]] [http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/windows/3501239/what-should-xp-users-do-when-microsoft-ends-support/ article]
* www.tomsguide.com [http://www.tomsguide.com/us/running-windows-xp-how-to,news-18270.html article]
* [[The Wall Street Journal]] [http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304747404579445800901503252 article]
* [[computerweekly.com]] [http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240181208/What-to-do-next-Windows-XP-end-of-support article]
* [[consumerreports]] [http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/03/how-to-deal-with-the-end-of-windows-xp-support/index.htm article]
* [[PC World]] [http://www.pcworld.com/article/2102606/how-to-keep-your-pc-secure-when-microsoft-ends-windows-xp-support.html article]

Much of the article contents are arguably "how-to" in nature, the following being frequently suggested:
* keep anti-virus up to date
* abandon IE
* use limited account

Of the options for upgrading, the following are mentioned (with number of articles mentioning them)
* upgrade to windows 8 if hw capable (6)
* upgrade to windows 7 if hw capable (5)
* buy new hardware (5)
* continue using XP (4)
* move to Ubuntu (3)
* buy Mac or Chromebook (1, WSJ)

In addition, many pros and cons of each option are discussed.

Here is a proposal for which I invite comment.

''' Proposal '''

* Split current (as of moment of writing, ie [[Special:Permalink/601153011|revision 601153011]]) paragraph 4 into two paras and add:
:: Customers will be faced with a choice of [[#End of Support Options|options to deal with the change]].
* Add new subsection under "Support lifecycle" as follows:

{{Collapse top | title=Proposal (withdrawn) |bg=#82D982 |bg2=#F5FFF5 |expand=yes}}

''' End of Support Options '''

The ending of support for XP means that no further updates will be distributed. The danger of this for existing XP users is that as security holes are uncovered (as regularly happens with operating system software) then XP systems will remain vulnerable to attack. The continued support for newer versions of Windows may increase the rate of discovery of such holes as some updates, while plugging the hole for the new version, may point to an equivalent weakness in XP.<ref name="eol_tomsguide"/>

Most corporate customers will be forced by liability issues to migrate to newer systems<ref name="eol_cw"/>, but for individual customers a number of options are available.

===Survey'''

*'''Support as proposer''' based on three arguments: '''1.''' I believe a significant proportion of readers approach the article wishing to find out the strengths and weaknesses of Socialist economic and political thought, based on a range of opinions from economists, politicians, campaigners, environmentalists etc. The article only offers a Criticism section and not an Advocacy one, therefore this article does not offer that function. '''2.''' Including a Criticism section and not an Advocacy one upsets the [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutrality]] of the article, giving unfair weight to one viewpoint of a much-debated topic. '''3.''' Socialism is widely regarded to be the alternative economic system to Capitalism, therefore it is reasonable to expect that many readers will view both articles if they start researching either topic. The [[Capitalism]] article includes both an Advocacy and a Criticism section, unlike this article which only includes the latter (also please note that the Capitalism article is not tagged for a dispute in neutrality but rather giving undue coverage to certain countries, therefore its Advocacy/Criticism structure has been accepted). While I realise the [[WP:Other stuff exists]] argument is not adequate for a sole basis of reasoning, the guidelines do state that it can be valid reasoning in some circumstances in order to maintain consistency of Wikipedia as a whole. I think it applies to this circumstance. Thank you for your time, any input would be greatly appreciated. [[User:Autonova|Autonova]] ([[User talk:Autonova|talk]]) 15:00, 26 February 2014 (UTC)}}

'''What terminology should be used to describe the sport variously known as football, soccer or Association football, within the Australian context on Wikipedia?'''

Main arguments used in previous discussions:

#[[Talk:Soccer in Australia/Archive 3]] in August 2013 strongly endorsed keeping the main article at [[Soccer in Australia]]. 
#The point has also been made that there is [[Barassi Line|regional variation]] in the terminology used to describe [[the Beautiful Game]] in the Australian context.
#The Australian association renamed itself [[Football Federation Australia]] in 2004.[http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/football-in-australia]
#"Football" is highly ambiguous in this context as there also exist [[American football]], [[Gaelic football]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], and [[Australian rules football]], all of which could also be referred to as "football".
#"[[Association football]]" (as used on Wikipedia's main article on the sport) is not a common name in everyday parlance anywhere.
#"Soccer", while thoroughly unambiguous, seems to strongly offend some editors in some contexts.

Previously discussed centrally at

#[[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive831#Australian_sport_naming_rules.3B_please_review_this_process_and_my_block_of_Macktheknifeau|ANI 1]]
#[[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive831#User:Orestes1984|ANI 2]]

#[[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive832#Talk_page_violation|ANI 3]]

'''Question'''

As the previous poll showed a simple majority in favour of tolerating the current inconsistency, but there was significant dissent (8.5-5.5 or 65%), should we recommend standardising usage for the name of this sport?

*'''Option 1''' Leave as-is. The sport can be referred to as '''association football''', '''football''', or '''soccer''' on an article-by-article basis, subject to the usual rules of [[WP:ENC|encyclopedic clarity]] and [[principle of least astonishment]] for readers. Any changes in nomenclature would have to be discussed and consensus achieved in individual article talk. Drive-by or mass efforts to change nomenclature without a local consensus would be treated as disruption.

**'''Option 1a''' As above, but deprecate 'association football'.
**'''Option 1b''' As above, but deprecate 'football'.

*'''Option 2''' Standardise on '''soccer''' on all articles pertaining to the sport in an Australian context. This would be somewhat like the existing situation regarding [[soccer in the United States]].

'''Format (2)'''

Because this has already been the subject of extensive discussion at my talk page and various other locations, I would like to keep it succinct here. I also propose to run this for only 7 days (unless there are objections or insufficient interest), so I would propose closing on or after 28 March 2014. --[[User:John|John]] ([[User talk:John|talk]]) 17:26, 21 March 2014 (UTC)}}

<math>
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial(\rho, \theta, \phi)}{\partial(x, y, z)} = ...
\end{pmatrix}
</math>
I think the matrix is wrong in some places by a factor of <math>\rho</math>. Specificly, the 3rd column, second row caused me great grief. Also, why not give the transformation in terms of the unit vectors instead of <math>\rho, \theta, \phi</math> (or as well)?

----

The matrix is correct: specifically for the element you asked for, you can use this Wolfram|Alpha query: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=derivative+of+arctan%28sqrt%28x%5E2%2By%5E2%29%2Fz%29+with+respect+to+z. You can verify the rest of the elements in the same way.

There is a slight dispute regarding this biography article's presentation of an incident. In a recorded interview, the politician Michael Grimm displayed intimidating behavior towards the journalist Michael Sctto, and multiple news sources described the behavior as threatening. However, it has been hard to reach consensus on how to describe it, and the opinions can be divided into two groups:

;The "add" side:
* Description of the incident as '''"Threats against journalist Michael Scotto"''' (the word "threat" can be found in multiple news sources)
* Inclusion of the quotes, as they were said. ("I'll break you in half, like a boy" and "Let me be clear to you, you ever do that to me again, I'll throw you off this fucking balcony")
* Slightly more detailed description of the event and the context surrounding it

;The uninvolved Admin view:
*''I have read the previous central discussion and the edit. I can confirm that it isn't ok to include the "fucking" quote or the unnamed rumour bit. I have protected the article in the WP:BLP-compliant state rather than block people. --John (talk) 22:48, 1 March 2014 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The cellist Pablo Casals is typically known as Pablo Casals in English texts, but as Pau Casals to Catalan speakers. The established consensus on [[Talk:Pablo Casals]] is for the article [[Pablo Casals]] to use Pablo, but the issue of which name to use on other articles has never been properly discussed. There exist some Wikipedia articles related to Catalonia that mention Casals. For some of these articles, the original editor happened to use the name Pau. My question for editors is whether the less common Pau should remain in these articles without any clarification that Pau Casals is actually the famous Pablo Casals. As far as I can see, there are three possibilities:
*'''Option one: change Pau to Pablo'''
*'''Option two: keep Pau and include a note that Pau Casals is Pablo Casals'''
*'''Option three: keep Pau and remove any mention of Pablo'''
I have included below further information about the history of the dispute, evidence confirming that Pablo is the common name and copies of relevant Wikipedia guidelines. [[Special:Contributions/131.111.185.66|131.111.185.66]] ([[User talk:131.111.185.66|talk]]) 22:39, 1 March 2014 (UTC)}}

;Proposal:
Declare Editor Reviews as closed and mark it as historical.

;Statement of issue:
WP:ER is woefully backlogged and has been for a very long time. Presently, the oldest "active" Editor Review request dates to October 2012. [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Editor review (2nd nomination)|A MfD took place in February 2013]], while it closed as keep, many of those arguing keep felt it was time for a discussion to mark the board as historical. While there have been a few recent reviews made, of those currently listed, only [[Wikipedia:Editor review/Born2cycle]] has more than the most cursory of commentary. While looking at the archives for 2013 reveals a number of listings that received attention (particularly in the wake of the MfD), the standard seems to be one medium-to-long comment, no real response, and then closure. It seems to me that this is very much a sister case of [[WP:ABUSE]], which was marked historical in December (though new reports were still being filed at that time).

Currently, the {{tl|Europe topic}} navbox template shows the four [[constituent countries of the United Kingdom]] or CCs (England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales) in brackets next to the UK. There is a parameter {{para|UK_only}} available which hides them from the template if set to anything. This has been how the template works since 6 December 2007, when the UK_only parameter [[Special:Diff/176171046|was added]] (see below for a detailed timeline).

[[Template:Europe topic/sandbox 2|My proposed change]] is to reverse the behavior of the UK_only parameter and hide the CCs from the template by default. They could still be activated by setting the {{para|UK_only}} parameter to "no" (not allowing just any text prevents pages already using {{para|UK_only|yes}} from showing the CCs). A comparison of the current and proposed versions of the template can be seen at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SiBr4/sandbox&oldid=597857003 my sandbox].

The change was [[Special:Diff/588274913|boldly made]], [[Special:Diff/588357445|reverted]] as "no consensus" and [[#British constituent countries|discussed]] a few months ago, with the main objection that a template transcluded on thousands of articles shouldn't be changed on the basis of a discussion by three editors. The purpose of this RfC is therefore to get more people to know about the proposed change and to discuss it and its consequenses community-wide (though not necessarily to know how many people support or oppose it).

{{rfcquote|text=
In discussions related to the titling or stylizing of names of people, especially for BLPs, the subject's preference often comes up. See, for example, the current discussion at [[Talk:Giovanni Di Stefano (fraudster)#Requested move 2]]. The principle has been applied previously to articles such as [[danah boyd]] and [[k.d. lang]], and in the case of lowercase names, this is already MOS-supported; see [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Items that require initial lower case]]. However, there doesn't seem to be general language recommending weight be given to a subject's preference in such determinations. I believe ''limited'' language to this effect could be beneficial in future discussions, and would follow the spirit of [[WP:BLP]] (this would apply to all biographies, though it might be of more interest for BLPs). Offhand, I know libraries give a great deal of weight to subject preference in [[authority work]]. I'm not sure what other fields deal with such cases. Journalism, perhaps?

The major caveat worth noting in any language inserted into NCP is that the subject's preference needs to be supported by other usage as well. So any assertions that a particular person prefers a particular form of name need to be supported, rather than accepted at face value. The language I have in mind would resemble that at [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (ethnicities and tribes)#Self-identification]], though whether it would be better to say subject preference should be "considered" or "preferred" is something that I'm willing to leave to discussion. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 16:46, 26 March 2014 (UTC)}}

Per [[WP:NAMB]], we don't use hat notes when the title already disambiguate the pages. We don't add a hat note to [[Tree (set theory)]] indicating other kind of [[Tree (disambiguation)|trees]] exist. According to {{user|Softlavender}} it is "[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Good_Morning_Britain_(2014)&diff=prev&oldid=598019193 a helpful hatnote that currently is the sole link between the two articles]", the function of such hat notes is not that, that's the function of the page "[[Good Morning Britain (disambiguation)]]". The function of such notes is to disambiguate articles that arises confusion in its title, for example "[[Tree (set theory)]]", when [[Tree (descriptive set theory)]] also exists. According to Softlavender, just because [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Hatnote&diff=next&oldid=582620550 Ego White Tray] added the note "'This section is frequently disputed and should never be used as the sole reason to remove a hatnote" ([[Wikipedia_talk:Hatnote#The_NAMB_rule_and_example|because it has been in discussion]]), the note is clear: "as the sole reason". The real reason is that [[Good Morning Britain (disambiguation)]] ''and'' "(2014)/(1983)" are two reasons why the note is avoided, and should be excluded.

The sentence in the lede mentioning women speaking about "their rapes" implies through the use of the words "their rapes" that all these women are speaking about an actual event that is theirs. In fact, we cannot know if all of these stories describe actual events or not. All we know for certain is these are their ''stories'' of rape; insinuations that these stories are all true should be left out, not only because we can't [[WP:V|verify]] the veracity of each and every one of them, it's also [[WP:NPOV|not neutral]].

So far, no clear argument has been presented as to why allege--[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/allege by definition], "to state without definite proof that someone has done something wrong or illegal"--is unacceptable for use in remedying the above issue. All that's been asserted in edit summaries is either untenable or simply a red herring, skipping completely over the whole point of avoiding false claims and maintaining neutrality.

(It is ''very'' poor form to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SlutWalk&diff=603211075&oldid=603210844 remove maintenance tags] notifying others that a part of an article is disputed and under discussion.

Since the section on women is too small to split into a separate article according to the rules of thumb noted [[Wikipedia:Splitting|here]], we should focus primary efforts on finding ways of expanding the mentioned section. Obviously, this is a tall order: female stereotyping in games has been more focused upon than male, yet male characters are very frequently subjected to similar treatment. Can anyone help find references for such instances, or people commenting on such instances, whether they be books or online references? Also, the way the article is structured seems a little imbalanced. Any suggestions on that? I have my own ideas, but I would rather not act on them at once as this is an article dealing with an important and potentially-sensitive topic. --[[User:ProtoDrake|ProtoDrake]] ([[User talk:ProtoDrake|talk]]) 14:17, 9 March 2014 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Should categories exist which have only entry and will never have more? 

'''Survey'''

'''Threaded Discussion'''

Couple things to clarify. There are two possible ways a category can have one entry: 1) a category has only one entry and certainly or almost certainly always will ([[:Category:People named Yahoo Serious]] and so forth); and 2) a category has only one entry, but its reasonably possible that someday someone will write another article that fits in that category. I'm particularly concerned with the first case. Editors may differ on the second case. We don't allow categories of zero on the basis of being placeholders for future work, but maybe categories of one are different. It's not terribly important, the main question is regarding categories that will ''never'' have more than one entry.

The reason this comes up is because at [[:Category:Songs by artist]] it says "'''Please note that all song articles should have subcategories here''', regardless of how many songs the artist has recorded" with the bolding in the original, and indeed this is operative, so we have [[:Category:Harlow Wilcox songs]] and so on which will never have more than one entry.

OK moving on, some things that come to mind are: From the reader's point of view, categories of one are not very useful and actually sort of misleading. If, for instance, we had [[James A. Garfield]] in [[:Category:People assassinated by Charles J. Guiteau]] the reader might click on that to see who else Guiteau had shot, only to be disappointed and perhaps puzzled or frustrated by finding only the only one entry. Categories exist mainly to aid reader navigation and it's not clear how categories of one do that.

And in a purely grammatical-logic sense, "category" implies two or more (from Wiktionary: "category: A group... to which items are assigned based on similarity or defined criteria" and drilling down we get "group: A number of things..." with "a number of" then defined as "several" and so forth. IMO rhetorical logic is not important, though, although it might be to some.

On the other hand, there are maybe arguments for having one-entry categories. It ''is'' tidy if all songs are in some subcategory of [[:Category:Songs by artist]] and it might aid ''us'' in our editing. For instance, if some song is not in a [[:Category:Songs by artist]] subcategory, an editor might think that possibly an omission and waste time trying to find if is or not, and so forth. And if so that's a valid point. And some people just like things tidy and there's nothing wrong with that. And there might be other virtues for the reader or editors of one-entry categories that I haven't thought of. An editor made the point "The recording artist is a defining characteristic of a song [and anyway] We have plenty of single-entry categories". These are both valid points I guess. 

And there's no need to be unduly prescriptive when it's not called for, to say to editors "You can't do that" if it can be avoided. Still, the point that single-entry categories might degrade the user's experience is very important even if such degradation is only minor and occasional. Readers come first.

Through discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:GabeMc#March_2014 here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bbb23#Seeking_clarification here], it seems that Bbb23's interpretation of 3RR is that ''any'' change to the existing text of an article is a revert and can be counted as such by an admin while justifying a block for violating 3RR:

I could quote court records containing the sheriff’s testimony that there’s no evidence to link the victims with the car burglary. I could also quote court records stating that the token found at the scene of the murder may not have come from Jon Wise’s car.

The Wikipedia article about the original 300 movie from 2006 has a very elaborate section called "Historical Accuracy." I need your help to construct such a section for this new movie also, but I am not an an expert on Greek history, I need to find some good sources to construct such a section. I will appreciate your help here. Please feel free to start editing such a section before even I start! Here is the Wikipedia article for the original movie 300 (2006) for inspiration. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)

Meanwhile, these are the primary details that I can point out to get started:

*  According to Wikipedia, [[Darius I]] died from other causes after his health worsened when he was preoccupied with a revolt in Egypt, after he spent three years to prepare his navy for the final invasion of Greece. In other words, he did not die in combat in Greece as shown at the beginning of the film. The plot of the film then tries to say that Xerxes (the son of Darius) attacked Greece to avenge the killing of his father by the Greeks, which did not happen. 

*  [[Artemisia I of Caria]] did not die at the Battle of Salamis, after the battle was lost, she still continued to work with Xerxes (as in the Wikipedia article about Artemisia). 

Here is a detailed BBC article written by movie critics, about the movie 300: Rise of an Empire, explaining the distortions:

http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-26484784

These two history websites give a lot of details about the roles of Artemisia and Darius:
* http://classicalwisdom.com/artemisia-caria
* http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/achaemenian/darius2.htm
(But we are still supposed to find other articles that directly focus on the movie, these history websites are not about the movie itself.) 

Here is a very authoritative website about the classical texts covering the writings of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus. In this page there is a detailed account that explains that Artemisia advised Xerxes not to choose Salamis to fight the Greek navy, but that the other advisers who were in favor of fighting at Salamis won out and Xerxes followed their advice instead of Artemisia. 

* http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh8060.htm

Here is a serious history article about the writings of Herodotus, where it is explained that Artemisia supplied only 5 ships to the Persian navy at the Battle of Salamis:

* http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/artemisia.shtml

According to this translation of Herodotus, after the Battle of Salamis was lost, Artemisia continued to work with Xerxes (i.e. she did survive the battle):

There is an ongoing discussion on [[House of Gundulić]]. The House of Gondola/Gundulić are a noble House from the [[Republic of Ragusa]]. Gundulić is the slavik version of the name, Gondola is the romance. Currently the article is named according to the slavik variant of the name of this noble family. It is indeed true that a search on Google Books shows the slavik version (Gundulić) prevalent over the romance (Gondola), but the advantage is very tiny (13,900 / 10,700 = 1.299). 
*Gundulic Ragusa OR Dubrovnik -Wikipedia[https://www.google.fr/?gfe_rd=ctrl&ei=JegFU4KgBcjQ8gfQtoGYCg&gws_rd=cr#q=Gundulic+Ragusa+OR+Dubrovnik+-Wikipedia&tbm=bks]: 13,900 results
*Gondola Ragusa OR Dubrovnik -Wikipedia [https://www.google.fr/?gfe_rd=ctrl&ei=JegFU4KgBcjQ8gfQtoGYCg&gws_rd=cr#q=Gondola+Ragusa+OR+Dubrovnik+-Wikipedia&tbm=bks]: 10,700 results

Such a tiny advantage justifies to check the consistency of the secondary sources (Indeed this should be always the preferred criterion). I could find at list four very recent (less than 15 years old) English sources from English/American scholars and edited by English/American universities preferring the romance version of the name. 
* Virgina Cox, ''The Prodigious Muse'' 2011 John Hopkins University Press - Page 15 
* David Rheubottom, ''Marriage and Politics in 14th century Ragusa'' 2010 - Oxford University Press - Page 73 
* Fernand Braudel, ''The Mediterrean World in the age of Philip II - Volume II'' 1995 - University of California Press - Page 1332 
* Norman M. Naimark, Holly Case, ''Yugoslavia and Its Historians: Understanding the Balkan Wars of the 1990s'' 2006 - Stanford Univerity Press - Page 56 "

The sources supporting the slavik variant of the name does not seem such as good in quality, although I am not sure because very simplistically the discussion was more about Google search vs. secondary sources, rather than secondary sources vs. secondary sources.
Other users have participated to the discussion but a majority in favour of one side did not arise, NOR consensus did. I hope this RfC will help to find a solution.

Should [[Windows XP]] contain this information about end of support?

This is a non-technical question about whether an article should contain certain information. Input from non-specialist editors would be appreciated and even a very brief response would be useful, though of course more in-depth consideration would be welcome.

''Addendum:'' [[Windows XP]] is currently seeing a surge in page views, moving up the most viewed list from position 4410 on 6 jan 2014 to its current position of 1150. Its page view stats can be seen [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest90/Windows_XP here]. This is very likely to be due to the impending end of support deadline, however people looking for practical information about this subject will be disappointed since the group of frequent editors of this article oppose efforts to introduce this information, on the grounds that it violates [[wp:NOTHOWTO]].

This is an effort, based on a referenced review of press opinion, to introduce the most important of the missing information, but in order to be convincing it requires the support of a larger number of editors than those who have already signalled their opinion.

Please take a moment to review this effort and add your opinion, for or against, to the poll.[[User:Upedge|Upedge]] ([[User talk:Upedge|talk]]) 12:36, 31 March 2014 (UTC)}}

One week into this alleged event, one would expect this article to be updated to reflect the change in tense and the initial manifestations. However, Google News has just three hits for this topic dated during the past week. The same was true when I ran the same past-week search a few days ago. Two of them are copies of reports from well before the event.

So what can we do? We can't leave the article as is. If the announcements heralding the event were a hoax, that should be noted. If the intentions were genuine but the thing fell through, that should be noted. But just as I lack sources for the rollout of the event, I don't have reliable sources to back up my observation that virtually nothing happened, so I can't write that it was a washout. Or maybe the event was never really notable and the article should be deleted. Any ideas? [[User:Largoplazo|—Largo Plazo]] ([[User talk:Largoplazo|talk]]) 22:26, 12 April 2014 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Should our guidelines on diacritics and spelling be rewritten to reflect the recommendations of major style guides?

<blockquote>
<big>'''Executive Summary:'''</big> The current guideline recommends resolving diacritic and style issues by doing a Google Book search in order to determine “general usage.” This is an “invented here” approach not recommended by any published style guide. It is also laborious when it done correctly (as it rarely is) and easily manipulated by partisans. The current proposal would revise the guideline to emphasize the use of reference works, in line with the recommendations of major style guides.  
</blockquote>

Wikipedia is built on the idea that our article on Foo should reflect what reliable sources have to say about Foo. By the same logic, our guideline on diacritics should reflect what published style guides have to say about this subject. No guide advises editors to “follow the general usage in reliable sources,” do a Google Book search, and count how many books use a diacritic and how many don't. GBooks isn't structured to do this type of research, and counting diacritics is an unusual skill with application only on Wikipedia. As for Ngram, it may be able to tell you which name is more common or which spelling is more common. But it doesn't detect diacritics with any accuracy. 

We need guidance that is short, sweet, and based on the advise of style specialists. All the major guides recommend that editors consult a widely available reference work, preferably a general purpose dictionary from a major publisher. The current guideline includes the parenthetical clause "including other encyclopedias and reference works." This clause suggests that editors that are already permitted to follow the approach outlined below. But it needs to be made clear that this is the preferred approach, the one the experts recommend. The guides recommend various dead tree dictionaries for use as a first reference. But their online counterparts obviously make more sense for our purposes.

I propose replacing the text in [[WP:DIACRITICS]] with the following:

<blockquote>
Issues concerning style, spelling, and diacritics may be resolved by consulting a widely available English-language reference work. Online dictionaries are available from [http://ahdictionary.com/ American Heritage], [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/ Collins], [http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster], [http://oxforddictionaries.com Oxford], [http://dictionary.reference.com/ Random House], and ''[http://websters.yourdictionary.com/ Webster's New World College Dictionary]''. ''[http://www.britannica.com/ Encyclopedia Britannica]'' and ''[http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/ Columbia Encyclopedia]'' may also be consulted.

''The Chicago Manual of the Style'' recommends ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'' (for American spelling), ''Merriam-Webster’s Geographical Dictionary'' (for place names), and ''Merriam-Webster’s Biographical Dictionary'' (for personal names). ''The Associated Press Stylebook'' recommends ''Webster’s New World College Dictionary''. ''The Oxford Style Manual'' recommends ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary'' (for British spelling) and ''The Dictionary of National Biography'' (for the names of British individuals).

BGN sets U.S. government usage in geography. The atlases and gazetteers generally get the names they use from BGN, although they may adjust them to fit their house styles. The “conventional” name is the name BGN deems suitable for English language usage. The “approved” name is the official name in the local language (or official Romanization if the script is non-Latin). Although I used the chart to focus on difficult cases, it is common for all the references, including Wikipedia, to be in agreement,  as you can see [[User:Prolog/Diacritical_marks | here]]. In other words, the way editors currently determine article titles is much closer to the proposed method than to the GBook counting approach.

This article seems to be a duplicate of the [[Euromaidan]] article and does not provide much information that could not be covered in that article. Secondly, this article's title is controversial given the unrest in Ukraine, and other issues. For many ethnic Ukrainians, they consider the change in government in their interests as a revolution, while for many ethnic Russians living in Ukraine they consider the change in government against their interests as a [[coup d'etat]], and as such there has been unrest by the ethnic Russian population. Neutrality needs to be upheld, and I believe that the Euromaidan article can address much of the material there.

I suggest that a second article could possibly be created that is titled: [[Ouster of Victor Yanukovych]], that would focus on the process that saw him rejected by the Ukrainian parliament and subsequently fleeing Ukraine to Russia.--[[Special:Contributions/74.12.195.248|74.12.195.248]] ([[User talk:74.12.195.248|talk]]) 14:26, 17 March 2014 (UTC)}}

Possibly is interesting to repeat as a background, to the community, the sequential reasoning done in the summaries, which gave origin to this talk: 

# 01:21, 3 April 2014? SacredLabyrinth: (+1,141)? . . (''??Criticisms: lack of conventional formalism'')
# 02:38, 3 April 2014? Polytope24 (-1,136)? . . (''material not supported by a reliable source'') ''[reversion]''
# 19:40, 3 April 2014? SacredLabyrinth (+1,136)? . . (''as suitably pointed out, content is supported by [[WP:RS|reliable source]]'') ''[reversion]''
# 19:56, 3 April 2014? Polytope24  (-1,136)? . . (''Undid revision 602624478 by SacredLabyrinth'')
# 20:35, 3 April 2014? SacredLabyrinth  (+1,136)? . . (''Undid revision 602626269 by Polytope24. please avoid [[WP:EW|unjustified reversions]]. regard the article's talk for any doubt'')
# 03:20, 4 April 2014? Bhny (-1,136)? . . (''Undid revision 602631653 by SacredLabyrinth. sorry that author is not a recognized scientist'') 
# 17:20, 4 April 2014? SacredLabyrinth (+1,136)? . . (''sorry, author is scientist and notable (see google, etc). if you think differently, so supporting your claim (no acceptance, etc) with RSs you should include it in the article refuting his criticism (after that critique, of course'')  ''[reversion]''
#  17:27, 4 April 2014? Polytope24 (-1,136)? . . (''Undid revision 602749947 by SacredLabyrinth (talk) this paragraph is unintelligible, and a google search brings up lots of results denouncing the author as a crackpot'') ''[reversion]''

Likely should be remembered to Polytope24 to be careful when mentioning living persons. Please keep civil, because your last summary can have been offensive to that author. Secondly as said before, your interpretations and opinions must remain out of the articles unless you have a [[WP:RS|RS]] to expose them (as Wikipedia's standpoint). And the fact is until here you didn't support your reversions with RS, you just did them based on your tendentious preferences. And at least once you didn't even write a summary to such radical edition.

That said, let us go to main point. It's sad see that Criticism section remains very poor and this in most part promoted by editor Polytope24, who [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Polytope24&offset=&limit=500&target=Polytope24 openly] and with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Polytope24&dir=prev&limit=500&target=Polytope24 obsession edits and barricades this theme] (string theory and right correlated others). Polytope24 has refused even that modest paragraph added by this editor. Oh please, about the intelligibility anyone willing feel free to make any [[Talk:String_theory#This_article_has_a_conspicuous_lack_of_mathematical_language.2C_which_is_at_the_crux_of_String_Theory_._._._Many_of_the_individuals_who_make_edits_seem_ignorant_of_basic_math_concepts.|improvement about]]. Can you tell us Polytope24 why are you so defensive in these articles? What exactly is your relation with this subject? Sorry to ask, but this has been very discussed ultimately in Wikipedia: are you being commissioned? If not why that attitude? What is your real interest here?

Likely editor Longerboats5 did the [[Talk:String_theory#The_.22Criticisms.22_section|best consideration]] until here about this [[Talk:String_theory#The_.22Criticisms.22_section|precarious state of things]]. He very well highlighted as important criticisms by several eminent scientists has been kept away from that section. As matter of fact observing that section we notice that it was really constructed to avoid criticism. Notice how it starts restraining the possible criticism to a specific kind and to a limited number of items. Well, this is ridiculous.

'''Proposal''' to remove [[WP:MINREF]] as a decline criterion, and subsequently to delete it from the AFCH, the Reviewing instructions and the Reviewing workflow chart.

{{rfcquote|text=
All categories within the [[:Category:Stubs]] structure should be [[WP:Hidden category|hidden categories]]. The current arrangement of stub categories as non-hidden is in contravention of the guideline at [[Wikipedia:Categorization]], where they are explicitly described as Wikipedia administrative categories. The guideline gives no rationale as to why these should not be hidden.

Stub categories are not categories which describe the topic itself and should be hidden in line with other such administrative categories as [[:Category:Good articles]] and [[:Category:Year of birth missing]].

[[:Category:Stub message boxes|Stub templates]], which generate stub categories, serve as a visual suggestion to the reader to expand the article. As a result, there is no basis for not hiding the category on these grounds (see [[Template:Unreferenced]] and [[:Category:Articles lacking sources]] as a similar effective arrangement).

Stubs have not been hidden purely for historical reasons. FYI – This idea was raised by several editors in 2008[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_talk:Stubs#Using_hidden_categories_for_stubs][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29/Archive_36#Hidden_categories_discussion][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29/Archive_20#Hidden_categories_discussion] when hidden categories were introduced, but the conversations did not receive much attention.

* Per the [[:meta:Wikilegal/Attribution requirements and role accounts|recent statement by the WMF legal team]], there are no copyright attribution reasons to disallow group/entity/role accounts in their official legal opinion.  This has long been a central argument against allowing such usernames.  
* The WMF has recently proposed a [[:meta:Terms_of_use/Paid_contributions_amendment#Proposed_amendment|requirement of disclosure for paid contributions]], which has gotten wide support and is on its way to being adopted in some form.
* Users who create a corporate or group username are attempting to disclose their affiliation in one of the most transparent ways possible, by making it their username.
* Allowing role usernames does raise the concern of someone suggesting an affiliation that they do not have.  This is handled in the German Wikipedia by OTRS verification of role usernames, similar to the way we currently handle [[WP:REALNAME|real names]] of high profile individuals.

Therefore, this RfC proposes that we amend the section on "promotional usernames" to allow role/group/entity/corporate usernames, with the same treatment as [[WP:REALNAME]]; if it is a high profile name, or misrepresentation is suspected, we will send them to OTRS for verification.

{{rfcquote|text=
I have encountered many bio articles that follow the style guidelines and list/mention only one nationality for people from disputed areas, which are potentially offensive/objectionable to the people belonging to the ignored nationality in the dispute. These include people from former colonies, those countries no longer exist, as well as Scottish and Welsh people.

[[Wikipedia:Content disclaimer]] says about potentially-objectionable content: "Wikipedia's current policy is to include such content, provided it breaches neither any of our existing policies (especially Neutral point of view) nor the laws of the United States" implying that any content that breaches WP:NPOV is outside of this inclusion policy and the disclaimer. [[WP:NPOV]] is clear on things that can be viewed from two (or more) opposing (or different) points of view, that they need to be described/presented as such, never to be presented with one-sided view point.

So, when the two view points (e.g. Algerian and French, UK and Scottish, etc.) are potentially conflicting and only one side is presented, then the article is in breach of NPOV in my view, and the potential offensiveness/objectionability is not covered under the disclaimer.

I am not confident what method (new policy, additional warning/alert to style guidelines, etc.) is best to lessen the concern, or if there already is a policy that addesses this, so I am asking for comments and guidances.

The author (who seems to have studied medicine not palaeontology) claims the paper was peer reviewed, yet at first glance I noticed an illustration that shows [[Velociraptor]] attacking [[Amargasaurus]], which is pretty laughable, since these animals didn't live the same place or at the same time!

Frankly, I am sick of this. There was a statement in the lede that the channel has been accused in propaganda. In the article, there is a section about this, which is well sourced. I did not add the statement, but after someone removed it I reformulated the statement. It has been repeatedly removed by one user in good standing, at least two IPs, and now by a user who edits infrequently. The removals have been reverted, not only by me, but also by other users in good standing. Not I was accused in blatant POV (note that the last IP tried to change the sentence adding that this is an anglo-american POV). None of the users ever made an effort to open a discussion at the talk page. Since I do not really like edit-warring, I have to open it. Please give your opinions on whether the sentence ("The network, particularly due to its coverage of the 2014 Crimean crisis, has been repeatedly referred to as a propaganda tool.") belongs to the lede. I welcome users in good standing to comment, not socks. Thank you.--[[User:Ymblanter|Ymblanter]] ([[User talk:Ymblanter|talk]]) 19:32, 29 March 2014 (UTC)}}

:''We've had our fun. Now let's get back to business. The fonts were a joke (obviously), but the proposal itself is quite genuine.''

After an [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 110#Main Page redesign|extensive discussion]] exploring the general idea of redesigning the main page, a general consensus has emerged that a radical redesign is not a viable short-term goal. But the underlying framework of [//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Edokter/Main_Page?withCSS=MediaWiki:User:Edokter/Main_Page.css that design] has proven to be a potent foundation on which any future design can be built, and replaces the aging layout practices of 2006 to bring it more inline with today's layout recomendations.

With that in mind, we would like to replace the underlying layout with this new foundation. Several advantages include:
# Flexible layout which allows future modifications to be implemented more easily.
# Responsive design; sections will stack instead of being pushed off-screen. This also makes the page more mobile-friendly (for those prefering desktop view on mobile).

Other than that, the main page should look very familiar. Some older version of Internet Explorer may show a small gap between colored sections, but that is a small trade-off, as the flexibility of this design is more future-proof then the current layout. Please test the page in any way you can, under any platform, and report any bugs. 

<div style="text-align:center;">{{clickable button 2|Main page with new framework|url=//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Edokter/Main_Page2?withCSS=MediaWiki:User:Edokter/Main_Page2.css|class=mw-ui-constructive mw-ui-big}}</div>

The use of the term "medicine" to describe the use of seahorses in Chinese culture is deeply misleading, euphemistic, and inappropriately takes the wrong side of a matter that is relatively factually clear.  The Chinese believe eating seahorses gives them sexual stamina.  This is not a medical problem; this is a personal insecurity.  Even leaving aside the fact that there is no evidence that consumption of seahorses effectively provides any quantifiable health benefit, for the intended use or any other, the treatment of this "condition" should not be considered medicinal at all.  The end result of this idiocy will be the extinction of the entire Hippocampus genus.  Wikipedia should not engage this issue on these terms.{{unsigned|12.130.161.8}}
:The only problems with this are a) Impotency is indeed a recognized medical condition, no matter what vulgar sitcoms say, b) sea horses have been used as medicine in Chinese herbal medicine for thousands of years, c) Wikipedia is [[WP:NOTCENSORED]] simply because you find some topics to be offensive, and d) Wikpedia is not the place for [[WP:ACTIVISM|activism]]: it is an encyclopedia, not a propaganda splatpage for Greenpeace.--[[User:Apokryltaros|Mr Fink]] ([[User talk:Apokryltaros|talk]]) 18:24, 31 March 2014 (UTC)}}

It was established globally, that the edit counter is to retain its optin (see [[meta:Requests for comment/X!'s Edit Counter]]). Before the global discussion, a local discussion took place leaning in favor of removing the optin requirements.  I am hereby asking again, since I abruptly stopped the last discussion.

;The explanation
The new [[toollabs:supercount/index.php|User Analysis Tool]], currently providing identical data to X!'s Edit Counter, honors the optin requirement, per the global discussion that took place on meta.  However, the local consensus to this may be very different from the global consensus.  '''Optin''' is having additional aggregated data be displayed about a user, at the user's consent.  It should be emphasized that this data is publicly available.  '''Optout''' is having additional aggregated data be suppressed about a user, if the user so wishes.  '''No opt''' is making the aggregated data be displayed, regardless of what the user wishes. This additional aggregated data consists of monthly edit counts per namespace and most-edited pages per namespace.

;The question
Should en.wikipedia be an optin, optout, or a no opt wiki for the edit counter?  This change applies to this Wikipedia only.—[[User:C678|<span style="color:green;font-family:Neuropol">cyberpower]] [[User talk:C678|<sup style="color:olive;font-family:arnprior">Chat]]<sub style="margin-left:-4.4ex;color:olive;font-family:arnprior">Online</sub> 21:49, 3 April 2014 (UTC)}}

There is a need for a third opinion from neutral editors on the lede of this article.

An editor is removing sourced information from the lede; is removing a map on the legality of stoning; and is misrepresenting sources. 

The originl lede included this:

:Stoning remains a legal form of judicial punishment in [[Iran]], [[Qatar]], [[Mauritania]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Yemen]], Northern [[Nigeria]], [[Terengganu]] in [[Malaysia]], [[Aceh]] in [[Indonesia]], [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Pakistan]].

This article was merged after being established since 2006 and being passed through a [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/5W Public Relations|few deletion debates]].  When it was merged a week or so ago, it was done with just a few editors discussing it without a more Wikipedia style consensus, and the user who merged it suggested, [[Talk:Ronn_Torossian#Company_coverage_removed|as seen above]], that "admittedly, there were only four of us in that discussion. Perhaps I acted precipitously.".  Since the merger, all info on the company itself has been removed, rendering the merge possibly wrong, and maybe making a case for re-establishment.

 Numerous reliable, academic sources describe [[UKIP]] as far-right. Please see some here:
*"While some forces on the left have benefited from New Labour's abandonment of social democratic politics, there is evidence that Far Right parties such as the British National Party (BNP) and United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) have been boosted by Labour's abandonment of social democratic polices." (Dr Ashley Lavelle: The Death of Social Democracy: Political Consequences in the 21st Century, 2013, p104)
*"Because of the party list proportional representation system, small parties have also had some success in EU parliamentary elections. Indeed, a new far-right, anti-EU and anti-immigrant party, the UK Independent Party (UKIP), cames in second to the Conseervatives in the voting for the EU Parliament in June 2009." (Arthur B. Gunlicks: Comparing Liberal Democracies: The United States, United Kingdom, France, 2011, p121)
*"Meanwhile, Conservative voters gave strong support to the far-right with their second preference; 41 per cent chose the UK Independence Party, and 10 per cent chose the British National Party...."

It's unfortunate that it's come to this, and I disagree strongly with the idea that you need a consensus to tag something as obvious as an ongoing dispute, but here I am, asking for support to add {{tl|POV-section}} to the "Personal life" section of the article so we can encourage more input and hopefully get past the original dispute. (I tagged this as policy since it's a site-wide issue in as much as apparently we now need a consensus just to agree that there's even a problem...). —[[User:Locke Cole|Locke Cole]] • [[User talk:Locke Cole|t]] • [[Special:Contributions/Locke Cole|c]] 20:41, 7 April 2014 (UTC)}}

For uninvolved editors seeing this RfC, this article is about a [[war trophy]] taken from the [[Battle of Batoche]] during the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion]] in Canada. A dispute over its ownership carried on for decades between the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] people and the descendents of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] soldiers who looted it. The bell was stolen from a museum in 1991, disappeared and then resurfaced in Métis hands in 2013. However, recent evidence has revealed that this artifact had actually been looted from [[Frog Lake, Alberta]], and the actual bell of Batoche had been donated to another church and destroyed in a fire. Some work will be required in this article to separate the actual historical evidence from the lore and the disputes that arose from it, both of which are historically significant. --[[User:Drm310|Drm310]] ([[User talk:Drm310|talk]]) 03:59, 11 April 2014 (UTC)}}

Both these are supported by the Cochrane review in question and the ARR takes into account the overall risk in the population. Thus many people find ARR useful for interpreting prevention measures.

This [[Talk:University of Wisconsin–Whitewater#Controversy|talk page section]] sums up the issues concisely. The [[University of Wisconsin–Whitewater#Controversy|Controversy section]] of this article is poorly written. Its sole purpose appears to be to impugn the university. It overemphasizes a couple of incidents of questionable notability. [[User:AmericanDad86|AmericanDad86]], who has been editing this section for months ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Whitewater&diff=581657027&oldid=577195501]), has disregarded all comments of other editors ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Whitewater&diff=next&oldid=581657297], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Whitewater&diff=next&oldid=581759024], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Whitewater&diff=next&oldid=581782429], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Whitewater&diff=next&oldid=581784228], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Whitewater&diff=next&oldid=581789416], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Whitewater&diff=next&oldid=594139012], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Whitewater&diff=next&oldid=594318913]), may have edited anonymously ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/65.30.57.225]), and I suspect has a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]], or at least an axe to grind.

The term '''''[[comfort women]]''''' is a literal translation of a Japanese term '''''[[ianfu]]''''' or a Korean term '''''[[wianbu]]'''''. 
Concerning [[Recreation and Amusement Association]] and [[Prostitutes in South Korea for the U.S. military]] these words are used in a different meaning from the article ''[[comfort women]]'' where the comfort women in the Japanese Empire era is described. 
Since I thought some disambiguation between the article ''comfort women'' and other articles necessary, I proposed some methods.
But I could make no consensus.
So I want to ask you weather the disambiguation is useful or useless ?

{{rfcquote|text=
As seen in the [[:Category:Filmographies|Filmographies]] category, articles about a given actor's roles are generally given in the following formats:
:*[Name] filmography ''(the most common)''
:*[Name] on stage and screen
:*[Name] on stage, radio, screen and record
:*[Name] on screen, stage, radio, record and in print
:*[Name] performances
:*List of [Name] performances
:*List of works of [Name]
:*List of creative works by [Name]
:*List of [Name] anime

As seen in the [[:Category:Lists of awards by actor|Lists of awards by actor]] category, articles about awards received by a given actor are generally given in the following formats:
:*List of awards and nominations received by [Name] ''(the most common)''
:*List of awards and honors received by [Name]
:*List of awards won by [Name] ''(although not in the category, see [[List of awards won by Andrei Tarkovsky]])''

Similar structures are used in related contexts:
*Awards won by companies:
**List of accolades received by [Name]
**List of [Name] awards
**List of [Name] awards and nominations
*In a sporting context:
**List of career achievements by [Name]
**List of awards and honours won by [Name] players while representing their national teams

An issue has arisen about the appropriate title for articles that cover both an actor's filmography and the awards won by that actor.  Proposed formats include:
#[Name], roles and awards
#[Name] roles and awards
#[Name]'s roles and awards
#[Name] on stage, radio and screen
#Performances of [Name]
#Roles and awards of [Name]
#List of roles and awards of [Name]

A series of titles using option #1 were recently created for [[John Gielgud, roles and awards|John Gielgud]], [[Ralph Richardson, roles and awards|Ralph Richardson]], [[Ian McKellen, roles and awards|Ian McKellen]] and [[Kangana Ranaut, roles and awards|Kangana Ranaut]].  This led to [[Talk:John Gielgud, roles and awards#Requested move|heated debate]] with many arguing that the comma is inappropriate.  Various alternatives were put forth, as listed in #2 to #7 above, with varying levels of disagreement.  Option #2 was regarded by some as an improvement but not ideal.  Option #7 had the widest support of the alternatives, although the chief counter-arguments were that: (a) the name of the actor should come first (despite "List of..." formats being widely used and endorsed by [[WP:NCLIST]]); and (b) the construction "awards of" is inappropriate for awards ''won by'' (rather than ''awarded by'') the actor.  The margin of a !poll on option #7 was close and the discussion was closed as not having formed a consensus, preserving the status quo.  Nonetheless, many editors will be left dissatisfied with the result.  The closer suggested a centralised discussion, which is the purpose of this RfC.

As further alternatives based on the existing formats, I might suggest:
<ol start="8">
<li>List of [Name] performances and awards</li>
<li>List of [Name] performances, awards and nominations</li>
</ol>

These articles, analysis and opinions, in more or less degree, imply the monarchy-related benefit, relationship and/or agenda of the ongoing protest in Thailand.  Considering these sources, should the claim "hidden agenda: royal succession" be represented as fact?

=== Brief, neutral statement of the issue '''

The issue here involves the section of this Wikipedia article titled "Security against tyranny".  ''Would it be okay to say briefly in that section whether or not the check-against-tyranny argument for gun rights is unique to the United States?'' That could be done in the following way, or in some other way:

{{rfcquote|text=
I am opposed to the expansions of content in recent weeks and addition of high levels of detail that have now made this ''summary'' article far too long: The article has now reached a level of intricate detail that would overwhelm and put off the average reader, who is more often than not little more than a student just doing some research or a casual reader.

According to [[WP:SUMMARY]] an article like French Revolution is meant to give an overview of all the events of the revolution (and there were many) in <u>moderate</u> detail, where there exist separate Main Articles going into full detail on specific events of the revolution (such as the [[Storming of the Bastille]] or [[French First Republic|First Republic]] which itself needs more expansion there). Certain sections in this article are so long they could be separate articles. I hate to point fingers and creep into personal attack territory, but while ongoing gradual expansion has been occurring over time through various users, it is evident in the Revision history that this article has been rapidly bloated in just the past few weeks by one person who added new sections and new levels of detail which I, upon reading, do not feel are fit for this particular article. There is also a journalistic and melodramatic writing style evident which includes excessive use of idiomatic, informal expressions that do not follow Wikipedia's [[WP:MOS|writing style guidelines]].

{{u|Nivose}}, I don't doubt your good faith and don't necessarily oppose the content itself, but there are Main article links scattered throughout this summary article, and I think you would be better off relocating such specific detail to those articles. And if you do relocate them, I would also suggest modifying the tone and writing style of the content to sound less like a news article from the era or student essay and more like a neutral, formal encyclopedia. I would like to get other editors' opinions on this so we can quickly get a consensus on whether the article needs to be shortened, which is why I opened an RFC. Thank you.

This article had been the subject of repeated, undiscussed, blanket rollbacks of edits from IP addresses that geolocate to Seattle, the residence of subject of this article. To avoid 3RR, I am RFC'ing the two diffs here. Because the rollbacks conducted by the IP editors are so fundamental and substantial, I feel it might be easiest to simply RfC the two versions ''en totale''. This version - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steve_Beren&oldid=609158797]] - represents the IP editors preferred version; this version [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steve_Beren&oldid=609158383]] represents, what I feel, is a more holistic and accurate version. '''Obviously no one can fully support either version''', but it would be appreciated if everyone could weigh-in on the version they feel is ''most appropriate'' to use as a "starting point" from which the article can be generally improved. 

'''Support (anonymous IP editor version)'''

The long-standing version of this article, which has been posted for a long time with only periodic relevant updates, was the result of a previous discussion - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Steve_Beren_%282nd_nomination%29   As a result of the previous discussion, the article was balanced - including negative information about the subject.  Also, the long-standing article's content was more accurate and balanced than the proposed replacement.  The proposed replacement places Beren's joining a Socialist party at age 12 or 13, which seems implausible.  Also, in any case, the subject is notable, if at all, for activities since 2006 - public candidacies, GOP involvement, and tea party agitation - and not for the fringe activities decades before.  A good faith effort has been made to include accurate and useful info from BlueSalix.  Maintaining the previously-agreed upon content cannot be fairly considered vandalism.  It is good that rather than an "edit war" some compromise and good agreement can be reached as in the previous discussion.  The previous discussion contains much that will be helpful in reaching a good community decision on the current honest disagreement.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/63.226.205.112|63.226.205.112]] ([[User talk:63.226.205.112|talk]]) 23:19, 18 May 2014 (UTC)}}

{{Image frame|width=220|content=[[:File:Postman ver3.jpg]]|caption=''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' seems to imply that the restoring of a nation could hinge on mail services.  It won the [[18th Golden Raspberry Awards]] for the worst picture, worst screenplay, worst actor, and more.  If there is an award for the worst spam, email services must be nominated at least.  Nevertheless, global communications in the [[Information Age]] hinge on self-appointed mailbox providers.}} On the right, the image which was removed.  I'm not completely decorticated yet, so, yes, I can understand that it looks strange.  Since three people, [[User:MatthewBurton]], [[User:Thumperward]], and [[User:Frietjes]], felt the need to remove it, it probably deserves that destiny and this RfC is going to be resolved quickly.

There is something in the conduct of those three users I don't understand.  It is their inclination to remove anything which might look questionable, acting quickly, without taking the time to try and understand any reason why it was there.  That's not only for the image, but also for [[WP:NOTETHAT]], [[WP:PROCON]], and similar directives whereby some passages need to be removed no matter what.  I understand that articles have to be evened out, but that should be done without altering their meaning.  This page, in particular, was problematic since the beginning.  Is it always possible to even out articles, or are there topics that are inherently wrinkled?

For a minor curiosity, it is odd that those three editors arrived in close succession independently of one another.  For more than one year nobody felt the need to remove that image...

If the image is strange, spam is strange too.  So strange that many organizations give up any attempt at finding their own way through scaring judgments (see [[Gordon v. Virtumundo, Inc.]]), overcomplicated software settings, and controversial specifications (e.g. [http://www.pcworld.com/article/2141120/yahoo-email-antispoofing-policy-breaks-mailing-lists.html DMARC]).  99% of spam is overwhelming (if you don't see it, your mailbox provider is doing a good job at filtering it out).  By comparison, setting up a company web site is straightforward.  I keep considering that a temporary situation, even if it has endured for decades and there is no sign of improvement.  The current state of affairs seems to be rooted in economic and social traits rather than due to technological constraints.  So the eventual improvement can be seen as part of the transition to that Information Age mentioned in the caption.  Thus, I found that Costner's landscape, as well as the unfair fate of that movie, render the idea better than a ranting section on "the pains of being a mailbox provider".  An alternative image, albeit less compelling, is the Tristero Horn symbol, after [[The Crying of Lot 49]].  Omitting to point out that a problem exists looks like a violation of [[WP:NPOV]], doesn't it?

Would it be okay to insert the following short paragraph (plus appropriate footnotes) in place of the following long paragraph?  '''INSERT''':
{{cquote|In the United States, one of the many reasons why gun owners defend their right of private gun ownership is as a check against tyranny. That argument has a long history in the context of [[Gun_politics_in_the_United_States#Security_against_tyranny|gun politics in the United States]], the argument has not been entirely limited to the United States, and an especially controversial feature of that argument in modern times has been the suggestion that more private gun ownership in Europe might have inhibited Nazi tyranny.}}
'''REMOVE''':
{{cquote|Outside of academia, some American advocates of gun rights, such as Stephen Halbrook, NRA leader Wayne LaPierre, and JFPO leader Aaron Zelman, have argued that the Nazi Party can be characterized as a gun control regime, and that its alleged practice of gun control was an enabling factor in the Holocaust.[39][40][41] Their arguments refer to laws that disarmed "unreliable" persons, especially Jews, but relaxed restrictions for "ordinary" German citizens,[42] and to the later confiscation of arms in countries it occupied.[43] They have used allusions to the Nazis in the context of the modern gun-control debate. Legal scholar Bernard Harcourt responded to these arguments by saying "[it is] absurd to try to characterize [the Nazi regime] as either pro- or anti-gun control", given the contemporary political context in which the term is used. However, if one had to choose, Harcourt would say that the Nazi regime was pro-gun compared with the Weimar Republic that preceded it.[44] He points out that there is disagreement within the gun rights movement on the question of the Nazis and gun control, with many of its adherents distancing themselves from the association of gun control with the Holocaust. He cites William L. Pierce, founder of the pro-gun National Alliance, who wrote that "When you have read [and compare the 1928 and 1938 German gun laws], you will understand that it was Hitler's enemies, not Hitler, who should be compared with the gun-control advocates in America today."[45] Robert Spitzer has said—as has Harcourt—that the quality of Halbrook's historical research is poor.[46] Opposing Halbrook's argument that gun control leads to authoritarian regimes, Spitzer says that "actual cases of nation-building and regime change, including but not limited to Germany, if anything support the opposite position."[47] Historian Michael S. Bryant concludes that "in exaggerating similarities and ignoring differences in their comparisons, gun rights advocates violate Charles Maier's test for tendentiousness."[48] The Anti-Defamation League has said that use of the Holocaust in these arguments, as well as being historically inaccurate, is offensive to the victims of the Nazis.[49] }}

Should [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Sailor Moon]] be marked as historical, be turned into a task-force, or be kept?

Note: The discussion is here, rather than at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Sailor Moon]], as this WikiProject is the latter's parent project, and also because the latter is inactive, and only two of its editors who are marked as "active" have been active within this year. Another reason is because one of the options is to turn WikiProject Sailor Moon into a task force of this project.

Over the course of this page, I added the incident of what happened on the company's official Twitter account; The United Airways official feed accidentally tweeted a pornographic photo to a consumer who was complaining about a flight delay. The photo was an image of an unidentified woman with a scale plane deposited in her genitalia. There have been numerous [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] that have been invoked to display notability for this incident, all discuss the content and the incident in depth, and no [[WP:NOR|original research]] is needed to extract the content. The concerns raised by the opponents include [[WP:BALASPS]], [[WP:NOTNEWS]], and [[WP:EVENT]], mainly the fact that the content is not relevant in the long term scheme of the company, and that it was a ''blip in the news cycle'' so to speak. They also have said that it was newsworthy, but not notable enough for an event. I must also note, as to not engage in reckless RfC's, that if there is a clear, early community consensus that this event is not notable, I will withdraw this Rfc. Thank you.

<s>The current WikiProject Comics Manual of Style reads:

"When disambiguation is needed use (comics), or (company) where that is not appropriate."

This should be reworded to make it clear that (comics) is a fallback when something more general is not available, especially in the case of ''characters''.  Perhaps:

"When disambiguation is needed '''and a more general disambiguation such as (character) is not <s>applicable</s>sufficient''' use (comics), or (company) where that is not appropriate."</s>

Perhaps I acted precipitously.".  Since the merger, all info on the company itself has been removed, rendering the merge possibly wrong, and maybe making a case for re-establishment.

Numerous articles related to ''[[The Real Housewives]]'' franchise are in poor condition and could benefit from some specialized attention. With seven separate installments, the potential creation of 34 season-specific articles (maybe even episode-specific articles), and numerous cast members that have found fame from the series, ''The Real Housewives'' is certainly a highly-influential part of reality television and has the potential of becoming a well-developed group of articles. I believe that giving the franchise its own separate task force within WikiProject Television will more effectively gather interested editors and will promote the improvement of these several articles.

Dear Wikipedia community,

I'd like to ask what is the WP policy for biographical articles of notable people born in Catalonia. I have noticed that recetly, some biographical articles of Spanish personalities born in Catalonia have a lede that looks more or less like this: 

-Whoever- is a Spanish Catalan -WhateverTheyAre-... Ex. [[Antoni Gaudí]]

In most articles however it is mentioned that the personality is Spanish only: 

-Whoever- is a Spanish -WhateverTheyAre-... ex. [[Dalí]] 

I think that in such a sentence in the lede of biographical articles, wikipedia generally referes to the citizenship of the person in particular. 

Since Catalonia is not a state, as of today, I think it is not neutral to add Catalan next to Spanish because it might create the impresion on the reader that both are Citizenships. 

in addition to this, I think that all these types of articles should follow some kind of uniformity or gidance to make them more neutral on these issues.

What is your opinion? Thanks [[User:Arcillaroja|Arcillaroja]] ([[User talk:Arcillaroja|talk]]) 13:38, 30 April 2014 (UTC)}}

*[[Template:Location map Israel ashkelon]] - formerly displayed [[:File:Israel outline ashkelon.png]]
All of these maps, along with [[Template:Location map Israel]] (which formerly displayed [[:File:Israel location map.svg]]), have been updated to instead display [[:File:Neutral Israel location map.svg]]. The reason for these changes was that displaying the Israeli-occupied territories in the fashion that they did was a violation of [[WP:NPOV]]. However, these changes now make it impossible to distinguish the Israeli-occupied territories from the surrounding area, and they cause all location maps that formerly displayed a zoomed-in high-detail region to now display a much larger area, compacting the points together. Should these image changes be kept or reverted, or should another option be considered?

''' Display [[:File:Neutral Israel location map.svg]] in all '''

I agree with Huldra, Dlv999, Pluto2012, Sean.Hoyland, BoogaLouie, and others that maps that show East Jerusalem as Israeli are blatantly pushing a fringe point of view and as such can not be displayed on wikipedia.

===Background'''

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Richard_C._Hoagland/Archive_2#Neutrality Going back to 2009] there has been disagreement about the length of this article. As I said above in [[#Lengthy coverage]], nearly 50% of the citations on this page are [[WP:PRIMARY]]. If that were to be fixed, the article would be severely under referenced. Then lots of material would have to be removed because, as [[User:StuHarris]] states, there are no 3rd party sources for Richard Hoagland's information. (See his statement above about "setting an impossibly high bar" in [[#Third party sources]].) So this leads me to this article appearing to me as a [[WP:SOAPBOX]] because there are no 3rd party references, I believe the content does not belong in WP. Trying to avoid an edit war of back and forth and reverts here. I feel for the editors who have spent a lot of time cleaning up opinions and properly citing everything, but it has become full of "scar tissue" because of that; completely irrelevant to be in WP. Thanks. Please reference the previous 2 sections for more info.

Is putting "The" at the beginning of an article title an acceptable innovation for [[WP:NATURAL]] [[WP:D|disambiguation]]?

Context: Recently, [[Talk:Hulk_(comics)#Requested_move|a move request]] at [[Hulk (comics)]] to [[Hulk]] resulted in a "no consensus" close. Multiple editors, while perhaps opposing the proposed move, suggested moving [[Hulk (comics)]] to [[The Hulk]] instead (as [[The Hulk]] already redirects there). [[User:Tenebrae|One editor]] intelligently noticed that [[WP:THE]] currently is directly opposed to that, as per its dictum that [[The Joker]] redirect to [[Joker (comics)]], and not vice-versa. But should that be the case?

*Please respond '''support''' if you believe adding "the" is OK in order to disambiguate.
*Please respond '''oppose''' if you think adding "the" should not be allowed, as is currently the case.

===RfC response: 2'''

Responding to the RfC, I've read the section and am mystified ... What exactly does the following mean in non-technical English?:
<blockquote>
A revelation of the study is the surprising presence of a Turkic-rooted woman among the Pokrovka Sarmatians, and the complete absence of any pointers characteristic for the Indo-Iranians, who reputedly constituted a bulk, if not all, of the Sarmatians.
</blockquote>
Is it trying to say this: that various people wrote that the Sarmatians were Indo-Iranian in origin; but they are wrong?  If so, perhaps it could be rewritten more simply.  Also, the word "reputedly" is a weasel word, so if we report the claim about the Sarmatians being mostly or all Indo-Iranian, a citation is necessary.  Here is my first try at rewriting the sentence which caused my difficulty:
<blockquote>
The study of the Pokrovka Sarmatians revealed two surprises: they include a woman of Turkic origin, and they include no people of Indo-Iranian descent.  The second point refutes the claim {{cn}} that the Sarmatians were all, or mostly, Indo-Iranian in origin.
</blockquote>
However, the second sentence contains a logical fallacy, and it's as follows.  Unless the people in the Pokrovka sample numbered at least one half of all Sarmatians - which is extremely unlikely - the fact that the sample contains no people of Indo-Iranian descent does not refute the claim that the Sarmatians were mostly (i.e. more than 50%) Indo-Iranian in origin.  So here's my second attempt:
<blockquote>
The study of the Pokrovka Sarmatians revealed two surprises: they include a woman of Turkic origin, and they include no people of Indo-Iranian descent.  The second point refutes the claim {{cn}} that the Sarmatians were all Indo-Iranian in origin.
</blockquote>

Note that I've glossed over one point: I've translated "the complete absence of any pointers characteristic for the Indo-Iranians" into "no people of Indo-Iranian descent".  If this is an over-simplification, feel free to fix it.

{{rfcquote|text=
There is an ongoing discussion on [[Dalmatia]]. Dalmatia is an historical region of the Balkans (mainly of Croatia), without any administrative or regional recognition but with historically relevant. Disagreement exist on the sources that should be used for the article and particularly to edit a map of today's Dalmatia. 3 archives have been filled with the participation of a few editors but consensus has not been found. Some users left the discussion, probably by exhaustion. The last posts have been mainly between two users: [[User:Silvio1973]] and [[User:Director]]. 

The most contested matter is the actual posting of the map. Probably without posting a map 90% of the issues would be solved automatically. Indeed this solution was proposed in the past (and it's currently supported by Silvio1973) but ignored by some users, particularly by Director, who for some reason is extremely keen to post a map. Furthermore, despite the difficulties already existing to find consensus on one single map, Director ended posting three different maps of Dalmatia. The necessity of such overdetail was questioned by Silvio1973, but in vain.  

Dalmatia is an historical region, and not surprisingly different sources report for this region different boundaries. This situation is common in the Balkans whenever there are no natural borders (such the sea or rivers). However [[User Director]] particularly insists in using the administrative borders of 4 Croatian counties to aggregate Dalmatia as historical region. This superposition of administrative and historical borders has been questioned recently by Silvio1973 and in the past by [[User:Joy]], [[User:Bejnar]] and at a minor extent by other users. 

Seen the difficulty to have a civil and joint discussion with Director, the decision of posting an RfC has been taken by User:Silvio1973.
One side note: Director insists in writing that Silvio1973 is pushing an Italian nationalist POV. This is a very odd allegation, because the contested matter (current borders of historical Dalmatia) has nothing to do with the recent or past history of Italy.

I added a wikilink to [[Moslem militia]] into the text about militia whose 1,600 members Đurišić's Chetniks killed in early 1943. Two editors were opposed and reverted me. They believe that my edit was WP:OR because of the 1975 work of Tomašević used to cite the text in question. Since Tomašević referred to this militia as ''"Muslim self-protection militia"'', not as Moslem militia he mentioned elsewhere in this work, they believe I failed to present evidence that this militia was actually the [[Moslem militia]]. Although I presented many sources that support my position, they remained on their position because they believe earlier work of Tomašević has advantage because Tomašević wrote it on English language, preferred on wikipedia.

Taking in consideration the significant importance of early 1943 actions of forces of Pavle Đurišić in which they killed around 1,600 members of militia and around 9,000 Muslim civilians:

This is a '''request for comments''' regarding the '''mobile site strapline'''. See screenshot, or click [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Mobile_site_strapline Mobile view] in any page-footer.

''' Background '''

[[File:English Wikipedia mobile site strapline on programming article.png|right|border|Strapline on the [[object-oriented programming]] article that reads "Last edited 11 hours ago by '''Goandgetfucked'''"]]

The Wikimedia Foundation mobile team has [[wmfblog:2014/05/02/the-wikipedia-editors-behind-the-curtain/|deployed a strapline]] across the mobile Wikipedia site. The purpose of this request for comment is to determine whether to keep the strapline on the mobile site, and if so, what information the strapline should include.

Please discuss, sign or add a proposal below.
{{clear}}

''' Proposals '''

''' Include last edit time and author in strapline '''

The strapline is fine to include the last edit time and author. Keep it as-is.

; Support

While the username itself might not be specific (Oh look, a fan of Pokemon just edited this page about a plant, how nice), it pulls back the curtain that [[WP:Seven Ages of Wikipedians#WikiInfants|WikiInfants]] might not know exists.
* '''The wording of the strapline doesn't imply ownership.''' If anything, saying that so-and-so is the person to have last modified an article is suggestive of a collaborative enterprise. --[[User:Ori.livneh|Ori.livneh]] ([[User talk:Ori.livneh|talk]]) 02:07, 6 May 2014 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Could we make add an edit to [[Wikipedia:OPENPARA#Pseudonyms, stage names and common names]] discouraging users from adding nicknames that are not used as substitutes of legal names in professional/public settings? Something like:
:Do not include nicknames that are not used as stage names or otherwise in place of the legal name. For example, do not write, '''''Zachary Randolph''' (born July 16, 1981) nickname "Z-Bo", is an American professional basketball player...'' because he is not known professionally by the nickname. Exceptions include cases like [[Shaquille O'Neal]], who commonly goes by simply "Shaq".

Please feel free to tweak or otherwise offer suggestions. --[[User:Mosmof|Mosmof]] ([[User talk:Mosmof|talk]]) 16:12, 14 May 2014 (UTC)}}

The wording of the page has been stable for years and it is frequently cited in deletion discussions even though it is not technically a guideline. There is nothing controversial here.

Concern has been raised that the use of statistics in {{tl|Weather box}} and {{tl|Climate chart}} in some settlement articles may be excessive, and so violate [[WP:NOTSTAT]], and that the presentation of the data may not be following guidance at [[WP:Embed]] and [[MOS:TABLE]]. A counter-view is that the data is useful, unique to each location, and desired by enough readers to make the use justified and within policy. There have been suggestions that {{tl|Weather box}} if used should be collapsed, or that {{tl|Climate chart}} should be used instead. There have been suggestions that such detailed data is best placed in higher level articles, either at state or country level or in dedicated regional climate article such as [[Climate of south-west England]], and that local level articles should summarise the local weather and direct readers to the higher level article for greater detail.

{{rfcquote|text=
Consider a situation where a sufficiently [[WP:Notability|notable]] abstract concept, theory, methodology, ''etc.'', is commonly referred to by the same name as a particular publication (usually a book) in which it was first introduced or made widely known. It seems to me that we should distinguish the ''concept'' from the ''publication'' in such cases, but it appears that this is not being done consistently at present. Consider these examples:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Abstract concept !! Seminal publication !! Related Wikipedia article(s)
|-
| Behavioral theory of the firm || ''A Behavioral Theory of the Firm'' (book) || ''[[Behavioral theory of the firm]]''; [[Theory of the firm]]
|-
| GTD methodology || ''Getting Things Done'' (book by [[David Allen (author)|David Allen]]) || ''[[Getting Things Done]]''
|-
| Tragedy of the commons || "The Tragedy of the Commons" (article by [[Garrett Hardin]]) || [[Tragedy of the commons]]
|}

According to the [[WP:Disambiguation]] guideline, we should ask: When sources (or Wikipedia readers in general) use the name in question, which are they most likely to have in mind? If the answer is clearly one or the other, the article should be written, structured and titled accordingly; if the answer is unclear, an appropriate disambiguation technique should be applied, possibly including the creation of separate articles for each. Yet among the examples noted in the table above, both the "Behavioral theory of the firm" and "Getting Things Done" articles are currently treated as being primarily about a book, rather than a concept, even though (I would argue) the ''concept'' is clearly the "primary topic". (Note that both articles prominently feature "Book" infoboxes, and the titles of both articles are currently displayed in italics.)

I would like to invite some discussion as to the proper way to handle cases such as these, with the related editing guidelines to be clarified as deemed appropriate. — '''[[User:Jaydiem|Jaydiem]]''' ([[User talk:Jaydiem|talk]]) 19:23, 4 June 2014 (UTC)}}

I'm troubled by the deceptive language in the Privacy Policy that was approved at the board meeting last week.

Success!  Then on the last day of the discussion period, it was removed by a staffer.  Now we have a draft privacy policy that does NOT bar browser sniffing, does not indicate that browser sniffing may take place ''and yet claims to be maximally informative''. That's an untenable situation. That's the bottom line. I've complained about this as [[Talk:Privacy_policy#Legally binding?]] when I noticed it, and was ignored.  I have raised it [[meta:Wikimedia_Foundation_Board_noticeboard#Privacy_Policy_—_Information_We_Collect_:_proposed_disclosure_is_misleadingly_incomplete|with the board too]] '''''[edit: and have support from Board Member Sj regarding the need for changes]'''''.  I hope the board adopts a new policy that is not misleadingly incomplete. I call on the community to pressure the board and WMF to approve a policy that is as honest as it claims to be.

There is a proposal on the table that as part of moving to the Draft namespace, all AFC submission banners and AFC comment banners on any AFC submission in Draft namespace should go on the paired talk page.

'''Support'''

#I would support the ''general idea'' of having a slimmed down banner above the submission and moving all comments and decline reasoning on the talk page. In order for this to work, it would be necessary for the banner to clearly link to the talk page. However the proposal by T13 would not be the right approach and would be disruptive.

The term '''''[[comfort women]]''''' is a literal translation of a Japanese term '''''[[ianfu]]''''' or a Korean term '''''[[wianbu]]'''''. 
Concerning [[Recreation and Amusement Association]] and [[Prostitutes in South Korea for the U.S. military]] these words are used in a different meaning from the article ''[[comfort women]]'' where the comfort women in the Japanese Empire era is described. 
Since I thought some disambiguation between the article ''comfort women'' and other articles necessary, I proposed some methods.
But I could make no consensus.
So I want to ask you weather the disambiguation is useful or useless ?

I'm still waiting for either a proper reply or an edit. The number 1.5 million is based on statements and not a research as far as it's clear in this article, and therefore it is wrong to present it as a fact. Even in the notes there is stated "however, estimates vary from 600,000 to 1,800,000", so it would be nice if the top could be adjusted as well. Furthermore, George Montgomery of the Armenia-American Society estimated a prewar Armenian population of 1.4-1.6 million, and a casualty figure of 500,000 or less. And Bruce Wein mentioned in one of his articles that "the best contemporary estimates by Armenians or their sympathizers were 300,000-750,000", so it goes as low as 300,000 (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-fein/lies-damn-lies-and-armeni_b_211408.html). I have also repeatedly read in articles about estimates as high as 2,000,000. Therefore the politically correct range should be 300,000 - 2,000,000, but whether you'd like to be politically correct or politically biased is your own choice, the top should be edited, according to the present information in this article to 600,000 - 1,800,000, and politically correct to 300,000 to 2,000,000. --[[Special:Contributions/82.75.32.124|82.75.32.124]] ([[User talk:82.75.32.124|talk]]) 20:42, 16 May 2014 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
An apparently ongoing dispute that has turned rather laughable at this point involves myself and [[User:Johnsmith2116]], who continues in his assertions that adding the heading for the next race (along with an italic date next to it) are standard procedure. While myself and others have told him that a blank heading waiting for the next race has never been standard, he simply won't listen. He even carried me to ANI ([[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive840#Abusive reverting, from same user, again, like last time|see here]]), which ultimately backfired. There, he left extensive clues of his violation of [[WP:OWN]], and everyone who commented sided against him. Now, back to the issue at hand, I see no reason why there should be a blank heading there with no text, hence the reason I first removed it. Do others feel that we should start adding the empty heading the week before each race, or should we simply go back to waiting until someone writes up the summary? ('''Note:''' In the page's form as of 0030 UTC May 23, 2014, the heading is left without the date as a compromise until the end of the discussion here.)

Should this article suggest that EEMH (European early modern humans) is the accepted term for Cro-Magnon or that Cro-Magnon is a subset of EEMH.

'''Survey'''

Please indicate your preference and reason below, and add any replies or subsequent material to the threaded discussion.

'''Subset'''

*'''Subset''' Looking simply at the sources we use in the 'other section', the first, ''Revised direct radiocarbon dating of the Vindija G1 Upper Paleolithic Neandertals''[http://www.pnas.org/content/103/3/553.long] only mentions Cro-Magnon where it says ". Beginning in the 1990s, several early modern humans have been directly dated to >28,000 B.P. (3–9). In addition, a suite of purportedly pre-28,000 B.P. modern human remains has been assigned to either later phases of the Upper Paleolithic [Cro-Magnon (France), La Rochette (France), and Konĕprusy (Czech Republic) (10–12)] or the Holocene [Engis (Belgium), Hahnöfersand (Germany), St. Prokop (Czech Republic), Velika Pećina (Croatia), and Vogelherd (Germany) (13–18)]." ''Early Upper Paleolithic in Eastern Europe and Implications for the Dispersal of Modern Humans''[http://www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/~lchang/material/Evolutionary/Time%20out%20of%20Africa.pdf] does not mention Cro-Magnon. The Trinkaus paper ''European early modern humans and the fate of the Neandertals''[http://www.pnas.org/content/104/18/7367.full.pdf] is used in several places. It mentions Cro-Magnon twice in the "The Morphological Mosaic of Gravettian Modern Humans" section:"Occipital buns are less common than among the EEMHs. However, prominent ones are present in 18.9% (n  37) of the individuals, including Brno 2, Cro-Magnon 3, Dolnı´ Ve˘stonice 11, Pavlov 1, and Prˇedmostı´ 1, 2, and 7", and "In addition, the Cro-Magnon postcrania, despite uncertainties in associating the mixed femora and tibiae, can only have had Neandertal-like or intermediat crurial indices." Another Trinkaus paper[http://crcooper01.people.ysu.edu/trikhaus%202005.pdf] not used in the article mentions it only in a list of early modern humans on p. 210. This is important because if it is correct that EEMH and Cro-Magnon are identical, we can use any references to EEMH as relevant to this article and the discussion above is moot. However, if they are not identical, then sources for this article must mention Cro-Magnon, not just early modern humans.

There have been numerous comments dating back to January 2012 or further on this talk page regarding length and detail in this article. In February I [[Talk:File_Allocation_Table#What_is_this_huge_thing_in_the_middle.3F|proposed]] that a good start towards addressing these issues would be to split out the ''Historical evolution'' and ''Technical design'' sections into [[File Allocation Table historical evolution]] and [[File Allocation Table technical design]] articles respectively, and leaving a summary of each in this article. Seeing good support, I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File_Allocation_Table&diff=608609899&oldid=608307463 started implementing the proposal] this month.

A news article used three times on this page is negative, sensationalist, unbalanced and unfair, giving interviews with prosecution witnesses and showing none of the defense arguments:
The Dispatch (a Mississippi news outlet serving Columbus, Starkville and the Golden Triangle) May 7 2013 http://www.cdispatch.com/news/article.asp?aid=24056&TRID=1&TID= 

This news source shows no editorial control and judgment. Its approach contrasts with news articles about Manning in reliable secondary sources, which publish both prosecution and defense arguments eg  

New York Times, May 3 2013 http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/us/dna-tests-rejected-for-inmate-facing-tuesday-execution.html?_r=0 

The Atlantic, May 2 2013 http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/a-ghost-of-mississippi-the-willie-manning-capital-case/275442/

'''Manning is seeking retrial in both his cases – if Wikipedia isn’t neutral it could cause him harm by misleading potential jurors.'''
As this news article demonstrates extreme bias against Manning I’d like to remove all text related to it.

The first sentence of the lead describes Obama as both ‘the 44th and current President of the United States’ and ‘the first African American to hold the office’. Should this latter description be moved elsewhere in the lead so that the first sentence focuses solely on Obama’s political position? As a quick comparison, the [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] articles mention their subjects’ social notability (being the first black and first woman leader respectively) in the second sentence, but leave aside the first one to focus on what they achieved, irrespective of race or sex.

The associated conspiracy theories are not mentioned at all on this article, other than a brief one sentence acknowledgement of their existence under ‘Aftermath - Cultural’. This is despite the extensive [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] article and even an article describing how many people believe these ([[Opinion polls about 9/11 conspiracy theories]])). I ask whether these should be covered in this article in further detail, assuming it is done properly and neutrally.
*'''Part 1:''' Should a new section be placed in the article that explains the presence of these conspiracy theories, describes some of the more common ones and assesses their popularities and reputations?

#May statements like, "This scene/character shown in the episode is not in the novel at all" be made using the novel itself as a primary source or is a secondary source required?
#May statements like, "Jaime gave Brienne the sword in chapter X of the novel" be made in an article about an episode of a television show in which that same event took place using the novel as a primary source alone or is a secondary source required?
#May statements like, "Content from this episode can also be found in chapters X, Y, and Z of the novel" be made using the novel itself as a primary source or is a secondary source required? <br>
Two editors feel that WP:PRIMARY allows them to state which chapters of a source novel(s) "contain the same content as" episode(s) of a television series adapted from that novel. Two other editors feel that sourcing these connections to a secondary source is required. All four are entrenched in their positions, equally convinced they are interpreting policy and guidelines correctly. [[Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution_noticeboard#talk:Oathkeeper.23Clear_violation|An effort at DRN]] just concluded without resolution in the matter.

*Some other relevant questions:

*4. Is {{diff|Breaker_of_Chains|607894480|607860588|an index of the book chapters}} in the Plot section valuable for the ''Game of Thrones'' articles and their readers?
*5. If a secondary source states that the film is based in the book, can it be considered a reliable source for establishing that the same events happen in some scenes?
*6. In the event that both a primary and a secondary source support the same statement, must the tag citing the primary source be deleted?  Must it be kept?

'''Bullet responses'''

''Please keep comments in this section short, clear and to the point.  Feel free to explain in detail in the Discussion section.''

*'''Disputed text is acceptable.''' OR isn't much of an issue here.  The idea that we'd need a third party to say, "Galadriel does not appear in ''The Hobbit''" seems excessive to the point of being silly.  Statements like "Jaime gives Brienne a sword in chapter X" and "Events from this episode also appear in X, Y, and Z" are straightforward facts, verifiable by anyone, as stipulated in WP:PRIMARY.  While WP:FILMDIFF might apply to full sections detailing every minute difference between adaptation and original, "Content from this episode can also be found in chapters X, Y, and Z" is a single line telling the reader what the source material was and where to find it.  No undue space is used, and no undue importance is implied.  Considering that the text in question was deleted ''even after a secondary source was provided'', establishing that the primary source is sufficient would be very useful.

==Background'''

{{see also|Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC}}
The previous RFC regarding Archive.is concluded that the site should be added to the blacklist based on statements that links were mass added to Wikipedia by the unapproved [[WP:BOT|bot]] called [[User:RotlinkBot|RotlinkBot]], created by [[User:Rotlink]] potentially operating as a malicious botnet that mass-added some Archive.is links to articles. Archive.is is an archiving service similar to sites like Webcite and the Wayback Machine, offering different levels of service up to and including not abandoning snapshots already saved due to modern changes in a sites robots.txt file as Wayback Machine does, while Webcite has presented itself as having an uncertain long term future.

The ultimate outcome of the previous RFC is that archive.is links, whether added by the bot or by individual users, be removed with an additional weak consensus that it be added to the blacklist. Since then the addition of archive.is to the blacklist has caused more issues, preventing editing, and certain users have chosen, even in the face of dissenting users, to impose edits that remove archive.is archives without replacing them, even if this renders the now dead link completely unusable creating [[Wikipedia:Link rot|LINKROT]].

The need for this RFC is to reflect the common talking point at the previous RFC that users, many users who actually used archive.is links were not properly informed about the discussion, and that the actions of a bot, malicious or otherwise, should not have had any impact on the links added by typical Wikipedians. Elements of the previous RFC relied on hypothetical and unproven future threats about Archive.is that should not have had any impact on the inclusion of the links. The original RFC found no issue with the quality of the snapshots provided by Archive.is.

The previous RFC posits that archive.is presents a malware risk based on the actions of RotLink and RotlinkBot, a belief supported by some users but based on a perception of RotLink's mass additions, however no evidence was provided that the site did or currently does contain malware. Protecting users from such malware was part of the reasoning for adding to the blacklist, although any ill-intent on behalf of Archive.is remains unproven.  As such, I think it is time that archive.is be removed from the blacklist, while sanctions and restrictions on the use of RotlinkBot and any other bots that attempt to add links in such a way that could be considered spam, remain.

{{rfcquote|text=
[[WP:MEDRS]] strongly recommends the use of up-to-date reliable sources, advocating for the use of sources "published in the last five years or so, preferably in the last two or three years", with some leeway for subjects (like this one) that don't have hundreds of sources published each year.  In general, however, using sources that are more than 10 years is almost always rejected for anything except purely historical information (e.g., citations to an especially famous paper in a ==History== section).

The current version of this article now contains about half a dozen sources from the 1990s—more than two decades out of date, in some cases.  (Many of them, but not all, also happen to be primary sources, including at least one [[letter to the editor]].)  

I propose removing all of the sources that are more than (approximately) ten years old, and if necessary, removing any content that cannot be verified by sources that comply with [[WP:MEDDATE]].  '''Do you support the removal of outdated sources?'''  (If you support it for some but not for others, then please feel free to identify the ones you would keep.)

{{rfcquote|text=
There has been an ongoing discussion on the [[List of Person of Interest episodes]] [[Talk:List of Person of Interest episodes#Adding 2014-2015 before season dates, duration announced|talk page]] regarding adding years to the season heading before air dates have been announced. This has gone dormant the past week or two, and I very much want a resolution to this debate, lest we deal with it once again next year. Based on the discussion, and given all the known info we get from the upfront events (for US television), here are two options that I am proposing be added to the MOS in the ""List of ..." structure". These options are the ones stated in the linked talk page discussion above, with slight formatting changes to show how it would be added to the MOS. (This can be tweaked to not seem as though it is biased to US shows only.)

* '''Option 1:''' When a new season is announced, a section heading for the upcoming season is used, however, no years are included in the heading. In the created section some form of the following sentence is acceptable to include, depending on when and what info is revealed: "In [month year], [network] renewed [show] for a [#] season.[ref] In [month year], it was announced the series would return in 2014 as part of the [[2014–15 United States network television schedule|2014–15 television season]].[ref]", with the return year and television season link changing depending on when this is happening. For series airing on networks outside of the US that may not have network television schedule pages, that part from "as part..." on can be omitted. Again, this is using all information that has been revealed. When an episode table can be created for the season, citing reliable information that air dates are happening, a single year (ie a 22 episode show beginning in September 2014, would just get 2014 in the heading, until episodes air in 2015) can be added to the heading. Also, per [[WP:LEAD]], the same prose sentence, or a variant, should be added to the lead.

* '''Option 2:''' When a new season is announced, a section heading is not used for the upcoming season. The following sentence is used in the lead, depending on when and what info is revealed: "In [month year], [network] renewed [show] for a [#] season.[ref] In [month year], it was announced the series would return in 2014 as part of the [[2014–15 United States network television schedule|2014–15 television season]].[ref]", with the return year and television season link changing depending on when this is happening. A section heading, with a single year (ie a 22 episode show beginning in September 2014, would just get 2014 in the heading, until episodes air in 2015) can be added to the page once an episode table can be created for the season, citing reliable information that air dates are happening.

As a note, when these options were on the Person of Interest talk page, I had notified all the users in the discussion there to state an opinion on these options, and {{u|AussieLegend}} was the only to respond. {{u|Musdan77}} also found the discussion and responded. Both chose '''Option 2''', with Musdan77 not opposed to '''Option 1'''. I encourage both to restate their opinions here as well if they choose, as well as all those other users in the previous discussion. - [[User:Favre1fan93|Favre1fan93]] ([[User talk:Favre1fan93|talk]]) 17:35, 1 June 2014 (UTC)}}

[[:Category:Association football chairmen and investors]] mixes two things, and therefore has two parents: {{cl|Association football executives}} and {{cl|Sports owners}}. It seems to me that it would be better to separate these. 

Also, the members of [[:Category:Directors of football clubs in England]] are mostly named "XXX F.C. directors and chairmen".  Chairmen are always directors, so this is unnecessarily long; it would be sufficient to name the category "directors", i.e. omit "chairmen". 

I therefore suggest that the football categories be split to "investors" and "directors".

'''Support deletion'''

* '''Support''' After having reviewed the bios for every sitting member of the U.S. Congress from Virginia, as well as a random selection of other members of congress, I can find no evidence of precedent for including summaries of their victory speeches in the electoral history sections, '''despite''' - in several instances - '''a preponderance of RS coverage of such content in the 72 hours after election''' day. While breaking with precedent might be fine in the case of a truly outlandish or unusual statement in a victory speech, American politicians, celebrities, and sports figures seem to typically invoke a variety of religious declarations in their victory, concession, and apology speeches. Finding wide coverage of a victory speech in the 72 hours after election is unremarkable and this line will not stand the test of trivia/non-trivia two years from now.

I propose that the flag {{para|attention}} be removed from {{Tl|WPBannerMeta}}. This is a flag that seemed to have its heyday around 2007, and its use has been declining ever since. It adds "This article has been marked as needing immediate attention" to the banner, and puts the talk page in a subcategory of [[:Category:Articles needing attention]]. It has the following disadvantages:
* No one really knows what to do with it. I have looked at about 50 flagged articles, and the issues have generally been: ''needs expanding'', ''needs sources'', or ''needs an expert''.
* A lot of the time, though, I can't tell what the reason for the flag is. There is rarely a detailed explanation.
* For every issue that I can think of that needs immediate attention, there is an article tag that would serve better. Or a wikiproject talk page.
* It is on the talk page, so if the problem is fixed, people tend to forget to remove the tag. So years later, there it still is.
* Few people look at the categories (which is why so many of the articles have been there since 2007).
At best, this flag just clutters up the talk page. At worst, the user might apply it to a problem that actually does need immediate attention, thinking it will make a difference. It won't. [[User:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist]] ([[User talk:RockMagnetist|talk]]) 03:00, 1 June 2014 (UTC)}}

This category was deleted - see [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2013_December_12#Category:Recipients_of_honorary_degrees]]. The category was deleted as not important and cluttered, with only four participants. I think we should have a wider discussion about that. The category is used on many other Wikipedias (consider https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6326860 ; on pl wiki there are dozens if not hundreds of subcategories of the "Foo-ian university honorary degrees". Having a honorary degree is one of the criterias of notability (see [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability_(academics)#Is_having_a_honorary_degrees_enough_for_WP:N.3F]]). I find it puzzling that we can say something makes a person notable, but is not important to warrant a category. Receiving a honorary degree from certain institutions is a big deal; nearly every day world news media has a story that someone notable received that type of an award. Current Google News search gives me for example a headline "[[Aretha Franklin]] Receives Harvard Honorary Degree" (http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/aretha-franklin-receives-harvard-honorary-degree-20140530]). Are we seriously saying that it's ok to have [[:Category:Awards by Harvard University]], but one of the most prestigious award Harvard can bestow, it's honorary degree, does not deserve a category? Such a category exists on German, Polish, Russian and Swedish wikis ([https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7337303#sitelinks-wikipedia]) - is it just me who thinks it's ridicolous that this type of award categorization is deemed ok on four major wikis,but not here? Sure, Harvard is a big deal, but awards from smaller universities matter too:  "[[Jim Carrey]] Delivers Emotional Commencement Speech, Receives Honorary Doctorate Degree" from [[Maharishi University of Management]] ([http://www.eonline.com/news/545506/jim-carrey-delivers-emotional-commencement-speech-receives-honorary-doctorate-degree]). For a last example, I just copyedited a bio that on a pl wiki has a [[:Category:Receipient of honorary doctorate degree from the Warsaw University of Technology]], well populated and also deemed important enough to create on de wiki ([https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7594238]). Finally, it's a category that fits perfectly within [[:Category:Award winners by subject]] (or perhaps [[:Category:Science award winners]]). It is my my opinion that honorary degrees are a major type of a science award, and deserve a category. I am planning on asking for this category to be restored, but before that, I'd like to ask for comments from the community. --<sub style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;">[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|<font styled="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;"> reply here</font>]]</sub> 10:41, 2 June 2014 (UTC)}}

;Does BLPPROD apply to all biographies or only biographies in article space?
*A [[Wikipedia:Help_desk#User:GreenLips|recent discussion]] on the help desk has determined there are differing points of view over whether [[WP:BLPPROD]] applies only to articles or to all biographies.  I would like to get the community's explicit consensus on the subject.  Although the policy BLPPROD makes several references to articles, I believe it makes a clear effort to distinguish between articles and biographies.  Indeed, this would be appropriate and in line with [[WP:BLP]] which states "BLP applies to all material about living persons anywhere on Wikipedia, including talk pages, edit summaries, user pages, images, categories, persondata, article titles''' and drafts'''."  So it would stand to reason that some a distinction is important.  These are a list of quotes where [[WP:BLP]] avoids the use of 'article' in favor of 'biographies' that I believe is relevant to this distinction:
:*"Unsourced biographies of living people (BLP) created after March 18, 2010, can be proposed for deletion using a special proposed deletion process."
:*"If the biography remains unsourced after seven days, the biography may be deleted."
:*Scope: "Although our policy on biographies of living persons covers all types of biographical material, the use of this deletion procedure is intended to apply only to actual biographies of living people."
:*Background: "All improperly sourced articles about living people may be subject to deletion per the standard deletion processes, '''but in addition, biographies created''' after March 18, 2010, that do not contain at least one source directly supporting the material may also be proposed for deletion under this new process."  I believe this line specifically demonstrates how BLPPROD distinguishes between articles and biographies.
*"If you see a biography about a living person without references, you are strongly encouraged to either source or remove any contentious material and look for reliable sources that support the remainder of the biography's content."
:*"This method of proposed deletion is an additional tool to be used in the interests of increasing the quality of BLP sourcing on Wikipedia."
:*"{{t|prod blp}} tagged biographies remain eligible for speedy deletion nomination in the usual way."
:*Most importantly: "Per this section of the BLP policy, badly written BLPs should be stubbified or deleted. Administrators may have to delete '''pages''' if the page's primary content is unsourced"  Pages, not articles.
*[[User:Floquenbeam]] believes that I've selectively quoted.  I believe, as the article history can demonstrate, that there were multiple authors with multiple writing styles but that the predominate policy, spirit, and intentions of the authors of BLPPROD was to distinguish these matters.  Obviously some leeway is needed for drafts that have no been reviewed yet, I believe we are currently facing the largest AFC backlog we've ever faced.  However, for AFC declined biographies after 7 days, I believe BLPPROD is appropriate.--v/r - [[User:TParis|T]][[User_talk:TParis|P]] 22:52, 3 June 2014 (UTC)}}

===Difference between iatrogenesis and medical harm?'''

{{u|Blacksun1942}} as you pointed out, the article on medical harm said that it included more harms than iatrogenic illness. However, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_harm&diff=611764911&oldid=608399229 I removed that statement as it was unsourced]. Something that comes to mind is [[medical debt]], which is a fairly new concept as only recently have people been able to get huge lines of credit in some places for health care which they cannot afford. However, I am not sure whether that cannot be termed "iatrogenesis", as it seems to be a problem originating from the doctor or a side effect of treatment.

What do you have in mind as the difference between iatrogenesis and medical harm? What material belongs in one article but not the other? Where do these articles not overlap?

I recognize that I have no source saying that the two are the same, but any source describing either of these terms seems to talk about the same concepts. The articles seem to have a lot of overlapping content, and perhaps it could overlap entirely.

'''[[Wikipedia:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]]''' was deployed to English Wikipedia in the middle of 2013. It was later removed after two community Requests for Comment, [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor/RFC]] and [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor/Default State RFC]]. Changes have been made to VisualEditor since the VisualEditor was removed. The English Wikipedia page [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor]] says that "The Wikimedia Foundation developers expect to make it available to almost all Wikimedia Foundation projects by the end of 2014" although the latest I have heard is that the Foundation is not rushing to push this project onto English Wikipedia against community consensus and [[:meta:IRC_office_hours/Office_hours_2014-05-19|"there is no 'official plan' at all with regard to the English Wikipedia"]]. 

This request for comment asks the community ''what additional changes or fixes we want WMF to make before we would '''consider''' re-enabling VisualEditor under a set of conditions that we could specify through a later RfC such as [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor/2014 RFC]] or [[User:Pine/drafts/VisualEditor default state 2014 part 2]].'' 

I am not personally voting in this request for comment but I may make comments, probably responding to any points about the format of the RfC, the close of the RfC, or future action to be taken after the close. --<font style="white-space:nowrap;text-shadow:#008C3A 0.1em 0.1em 1.5em,#01796F -0.1em -0.1em 1.5em;color:#000000">[[User:Pine|<font color="#01796F"><b>Pine</b></font>]][[User talk:Pine|<font color="#01796F"><sup>✉</sup></font>]]</font> 07:35, 7 June 2014 (UTC)}}

I spoke to a fellow Wikipedian (it's not my place to name names); who has gone through the article and the talk page and said that the previous genre changing poll was a bit weak to exclude certain genres from the article and that someone had only gave one source that states that Unapologetic is a pop album and that it was not enough to just keep it as a ''just'' a pop album; Rolling Stone notes that the stark, shadowy R&B on the album, the Guardian categorizes the music as R&B-pop (with dubstep drops on one of the Guaridan reviews), also it should take into note that Unapologetic won an R&B album award in 2013 which also gives evidence that the album is an R&B album so I propose that we include definitely R&B and possibly dubstep to the genre info box.[[User:LuvmeorHateme|LuvmeorHateme]] ([[User talk:LuvmeorHateme|talk]]) 10:52, 5 July 2014 (UTC)}}

The purpose of this RfC is to establish what weight if any should be assigned to the source "Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI" by Francisco Lizcano Fernandez, and how it should be represented.

'''Discussion'''

*This souce should have '''no weight''' in this general article about Mexico, or in the section about Mexican Demography. The article is not frequently cited in the literature on Mexican work about Mexico. It is cited in a few specialized studies on racial demography, because it is the only source that provides numbers for the relative percentages of "europeans", "indians" and "mixed" populations - for this reason it may be relevant to cite the article in the specialized article about Mexican demography. Its claims about the ethnic composition of Latin American are contradicted by most mainstream sources on Mexican anthropology which do not consider "Latin", "Iberian", "creole", "garifuna" or "indigena" (groups that are based on the colonial casta system of racial classification) to be valid ethnic groups (with the exception of Garifuna which is however used in a different sense by Lizcano to refer not to the Garifuna indigenous group but to populations with mixed African-Indigenous biological ancestry). If it were to be included it would require several lines of explanation of the position of this study in relation to mainstream views in order not to misinform the reader. Furthermore the attempt to use the source for claims about the number of "white people" in Mexico are based on misrepresenting the source which does not claim to give this figure, only to give a figure for people with Iberian or Indoeuropean ancestry, which in fact states specifically does not equate "white" in the Latin American context.[[User talk:Maunus|User:Maunus ·ʍaunus·snunɐw·]] 03:56, 12 June 2014 (UTC)}}

A number of editors have been asserting on thread at RS/N that [[Russia Today]] and the [[Voice of Russia]], which are owned or operated by the government of Russia are not RS in an attempt to make a blanket dismissal of the source, preventing its use on Wikipedia for any purpose.</br>

In light of the sprawling thread at the RS/N [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Russia_Today]], which appears to involve a lot of contentious assertions not related to the Guideline, it seems that an RfC is needed to prevent the consensus building procedure at RS/N from being impeded for the same reasons.</br>

Aside from the general section on '''News organizations''', the section on Biased or opinionated sources<blockquote>''Sometimes non-neutral sources are the best possible sources for supporting information about the different viewpoints held on a subject. While a source may be biased, it may be reliable in the specific context. When dealing with a potentially biased source, editors should consider whether the source meets the normal requirements for reliable sources, such as editorial control and a reputation for fact-checking.''</blockquote>the section on '''Context matters'''<blockquote>''The reliability of a source depends on context. Each source must be carefully weighed to judge whether it is reliable for the statement being made in the Wikipedia article and is an appropriate source for that content. In general, the more people engaged in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the writing, the more reliable the publication.''</blockquote>and the section on <s>'''Questionable sources'''<blockquote>''Questionable sources are those with a poor reputation for checking the facts, or with no editorial oversight.  Such sources include websites and publications expressing views that are widely acknowledged as extremist, that are promotional in nature, or which rely heavily on rumors and personal opinions. Questionable sources are generally unsuitable for citing contentious claims about third parties, which includes claims against institutions, persons living or dead, as well as more ill-defined entities. The proper uses of a questionable source are very limited.''</s></blockquote><blockquote>'''<u>Biased or opinionated sources'''</br>Wikipedia articles are required to present a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]]. However, reliable sources are not required to be neutral, unbiased, or objective. Sometimes non-neutral sources are the best possible sources for supporting information about the different viewpoints held on a subject.</br>While a source may be biased, it may be reliable in the specific [[#Context matters|context]].  When dealing with a potentially biased source, editors should consider whether the source meets the normal requirements for reliable sources, such as editorial control and a reputation for fact-checking.</u></blockquote> would seem to be relevant passages from the Guideline to this RfC.</br>  

It has been established, for example, that RT has a [http://rt.com/about-us/memberships-awards/ well-established reputation for fact checking] on a par with many RS news organizations, and the opposite having no editorial control, the claim is that they have excessive editorial control, making them biased.--[[User:Ubikwit|<span style="text-shadow:black 0.07em 0.03em;class=texhtml"><font face="Papyrus">Ubikwit</font></span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Ubikwit| 連絡 ]]</sup><sub>[[Special:contributions/Ubikwit|<font color="#801818" face="Papyrus">見学/迷惑</font>]]</sub> 00:59, 20 June 2014 (UTC)}}

===Background'''

For the longest time, it was necessary to link dates (e.g. [[January 1]], [[1970]]) so the wiki software could format them automatically.  Because this was often used in mainspace, it was desirable to keep those links blue and relevant, so four-digit number articles, by convention, are about years (if it existed, the corresponding natural number would be at [[1970 (number)]]).  Since people write about lots of different time periods on Wikipedia, this also extends to three-, two- and one-digit numbers (but not five and larger, because we are (apparently) not the [[Long Now Foundation]]); [[5]] is the year 5, not the number 5.

However, this linking is no longer necessary.  We had [[WP:RFAR/DDL|a nice long edit war over whether it should still happen]], of course, but I digress.  Currently, fewer than 50 pages link to [[5]],[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AWhatLinksHere&target=5&namespace=0] while ''many'' more link to its numerical counterpart.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AWhatLinksHere&target=5+%28number%29&namespace=0]  One wonders whether the year is truly the primary topic for the numeral.

'''Question'''

Should we rename [[1]] through [[99]] to [[1 AD]] through [[99 AD]] (the precise naming scheme here is negotiable), then rename [[1 (number)]] through [[99 (number)]] to [[1]] through [[99]], and finally amend [[WP:NCNUM]] to account for the change?

NB: This intentionally only extends to one- and two-digit years, because larger numbers are less important while more recent years are more important.  We may later revisit this discussion for three-digit years, but they are not part of this proposal.  --'''''[[User:NYKevin|<span style="color:red">N</span>]][[User talk:NYKevin|<span style="color:green">Y</span>]][[Special:Contributions/NYKevin|<span style="color:blue">Kevin</span>]]'''''  21:51, 21 June 2014 (UTC)}}

;Background:
: There has recently been some discussion on [[Wikipedia talk:Signatures#"Font" Deprecated?]] specifically about if "* Avoid [[:wikt:deprecated|deprecated]] markup such as the {{Tag|[[HTML element#font|font]]|o}} tag." should be in the [[WP:SIGAPP]] section of our police on Wikipedia.  Because of this disagreement, and based on a comment from that discussion by {{U|Redrose64}}, which I quote, {{Tq|the FONT element has been deprecated since at least [http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/present/graphics.html#h-15.2.2 HTML 4.01] (24 December 1999); in the present HTML 5 spec, it is [http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/obsolete.html#font marked as obsolete].}}, I started doing some research as these elements have been deprecated nearly '''fifteen years''' now.  Visiting https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/font the first thing I'm struck by is a big red box that says {{!xt|"'''Obsolete''': This feature is obsolete.

 Are Referenced Credible Sources on Jenny's Vaccination Views and Impacts "Fancruft"?

I recently attempted to add the following to the article:

In July 2013 the Huffington Post published an article entitled "Jenny McCarthy's Got The Wrong View On Vaccinations", which reported that:
: "...since the idea of refusing vaccinations in order to prevent autism became popularized in the United States in 2007, more than 1,000 children have died and 100,000 were sickened by illnesses that could have been prevented by vaccines"<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rachel-lincoln-sarnoff/jenny-mccarthys-got-the-wrong-view-on-vaccinations_b_3605185.html</ref><ref>http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/Anti-Vaccine_Body_Count/Home.html</ref>

The content above was repeatedly deleted because the deleting users labeled it "fancruft". For the uninitiated, "fancruft" is a term sometimes used in Wikipedia to imply that a selection of content is of importance only to a small population of enthusiastic fans of the subject in question.

Now, I'm not the smartest person in the world by any means, but even I know that vaccinations and vaccination policy is hardly "fancruft".  Nor are McCarthy's views on the matter. One of the deleters made a crack about "HuffPo", which I can only guess reveals some kind of political agenda on the part of the deleter and therefore wholly inappropriate for wikipedia.  That deleter also wrote an admonishment that "This BLP article has extra scrutiny".  I think that was an incoherent attempt to refer to wikipedia's policy regarding article on living people.

So what does wikipedia require of such articles?  Per wikipedia, "Such material requires a high degree of sensitivity, and must adhere strictly to all applicable laws in the United States, to this policy, and to Wikipedia's three core content policies:

1) Neutral point of view (NPOV)
2) Verifiability (V)
3) No original research (NOR)"

Lets look at each of these points, in reverse order for discussion purposes.

"No original research": I merely ask that the reference to a published piece from a mass media source and a quote from it be added to the article.  Nothing original.  Check.

"Verifiability": per Wikipedia, this means that people reading and editing the encyclopedia can check that the information comes from a reliable source.  Further, wikipedia says  : "Several newspapers, magazines, and other news organizations host columns on their web sites that they call blogs. These may be acceptable sources if the writers are professionals, but use them with caution because the blog may not be subject to the news organization's normal fact-checking process"

The source I tried to add is a piece published by the Huffington Post, and the byline is from a professional blogger by the name of Rachel Lincoln Sarnoff.  So before I added any content to this wiki article, I investigated it for compliance with wiki policies.  What did I find?  A piece that was heavily linked and sourced.  Where the piece covered the same data points already existing in this article, they stated the same things and even cited the same or similar sources.

But the key reason I wanted to add the piece to this wiki article is its information on the number of preventable illnesses and deaths that had been caused by a lack of vaccinations.  So, following wikipedia guidelines, I checked her sources.  The Huffington Post piece sited a website that had calculated the body count of preventable illnesses and deaths.  So I went to that website.  What were its sources?  Its sources are the weekly "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports" put out be the Centers for disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Every count is linked back to such a report.  Don't believe me and unwilling to check?  Then try http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/Anti-Vaccine_Body_Count/Preventable_Deaths.html.  Verifiability?  check.

"Neutral Point of View": This is key.  According to wikipedia, this means "representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic."  I heartily agree with this criteria, which is why I added the Huffington Post piece to this article.  Where else in the wiki article is a reference to the CDC views on illnesses and deaths caused that were preventable had vaccinations occurred as recommended? Where? Should we just assume that McCarthy's vaccination views are without consequence to public health?  If so, I humbly but forcefully ask that people take the time and effort I have to find material that meets the 3 criteria above to assert that McCarthy's and those that share her views on vaccinations have NOT had an impact on preventable illnesses and deaths.

Adding the Huffington Post article is also a common sense move.  If vaccinations are as successful as claimed in wikipedia articles, then isn't the avoidance of vaccinations something that will lead to the illnesses and deaths that vaccines prevent?  But the wrong way to go about that is to censure this article and suppress information that meets wikipedia's standards.

Lastly, I note that the McCarthy wiki article currently contains McCarthy's assertion that she was never against vaccinations etc in the October 2013 interview (that ironically was probably done in whole or part because of the fallout from the widely-read Huffington Post piece in July that I'm trying to add).  That's a classic "moving the goalposts" fallacy among other travesties.  But that's only apparent if the article and history itself retains documentation and knowledge of her many years in fighting child vaccinations. We can slowly or quickly scrub this article and perhaps history itself of her high profile efforts in fighting vaccinations so that only her denial of doing so is the only remaining record, but why would we voluntarily do that?  Why?  And why here of all places?

In short, we should fight censorship, bias and protection by fans and allow the Huffington Post article reference and quote into the wiki article.  Specifically because this is a living person, we need to be especially vigilant in keeping this neutral.  Alternatively, since the key is the CDC data to the piece I want to add, people need to provide a great deal of information refuting CDC statistics on vaccinations that is not original research, is neutral, and is verifiable.  A few smug, refuted comments in the comment section of deleting content doesn't cut it per wikipedia standards.

I am getting seriously tired of all the, to be extremely blunt, crappy articles about this or that college, that because of the near automatic presumption of notability are littering Wikipedia. It's becoming rare for me to get through a single page of new articles on [[WP:NPP|NPP]] without running into one or more of them. They are often completely unsourced and highly promotional. Even the one's that do have some sources, are often so poor and or obviously promotional that they would get nuked in an AfD discussion if the topic was anything other than schools. WHY ARE SCHOOLS A SACRED COW ON WIKIPEDIA? 

I am considering putting up a proposal to require that all schools and colleges be subject to the exact same standards as any other topic, specifically significant coverage in multiple reliable sources to be considered notable. -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 16:02, 13 June 2014 (UTC)}}

The custom over the past several years is to put several stub templates on an article as a means of categorization. The reason for doing this made sense—people wanting to work on stubs having to do with Subject Matter X can look at the category for stubs in Subject Matter X, while said article would also be appealing to those working on articles in Subject Matter Y. But from the [[user experience]] point of view, it's a problematic proposition. Imagine going to an article and seeing:
: ''This article is an X stub.''
: ''This article is a Y stub.''
: ''This article is a Z stub.''
Why does it say the same thing three times? I already knew it was a stub when I read it was one the first time! I thus propose that articles are limited to '''one stub template per article'''. Using WikiProject templates on the talk page, we can sort articles into as many stub categories as we like. For the purposes of presentation, however, I think one template would suffice. (I would support further changes to the way we handle stubs on Wikipedia but let's just do one thing at a time.) [[User:Harej|Harej]] ([[User talk:Harej|talk]]) 01:16, 14 June 2014 (UTC)}}

Is the following statement true to the source it is referenced from.  Statement to be placed in the article [[Blue Army (Poland)]], about Haller's troops: "They also committed acts of rape and destroyed prayer books and sacred scrolls in the synagogues."  Original source reads:  "Looting and robbery, therefore, were consistently accompanied by beatings, rapes, and wanton destruction of prayer books and sacred scrolls in the synagogues. The congruence of ethnic and ideological animosities also precipitated assaults. Two units - Poznan regiments and General Josef Haller's army - especially earned the reputation of notorious Jew-baiters and staged brutal pogroms in Sambor, the Lwow district, and Grodek Jagiellonski."

Does the statement reflect the source accurately?

It appears to me, that because the information was in one paragraph, the author describes the nature of anti-Jewish violence and singles out Haller's Army as one of two units particularly engaged in such violence.  Therefore it is not original research or synthesis but a description of what that author wrote.  Author described types of violence, and named a perpetrator.  So details about the type of violence are applicable to an article about the perpetrator.           

Another editor states that because the author did not state "Haller's Army committed rape" this passage cannot be used as a reference for describing details of violence such as rape, and therefore the statement "They also committed acts of rape and destroyed prayer books and sacred scrolls in the synagogues." should be removed.

The article reads "As the army traveled further east, some of Haller's soldiers as a way to exact retribution looted Jewish houses, pushed local Jews off moving trains."

Book says "The Polish troops, in particular Haller's Boys and the regiments from Great Poland (the western province of Poland) engaged in violence, looting and other atrocities against Jews.  At every railway station on their way further east, the soldiers harassed each passing Jew and sacked the nearby houses.  Very often Jews were pushed off moving trains."  A footnote reads: "'''much factual material on atrocities committed by Polish troops was presented in reports from  foreign missions to Poland, in the foreign press, and despite severe censorship in the Jewish and Socialist press in Poland."

An editor claims this is dubious because he states that foreign press and foreign missions to Poland, as well as Jewish or Socialist sources, are not objective and thus the reliable source writes something dubious.  I claim that we don't second-guess reliable sources and their work and simply report what those sources say.

I find that newspaper reports are often cursory descriptions of the nature of the crime. Other sources used in this article are biased and do not accurately represent the conviction.

I found more detailed descriptions, made by:
1) [http://www.start.umd.edu/sites/default/files/files/publications/Countermeasures_FALN.pdf ''Effects and effectiveness of law enforcement intelligence measures to counter homegrown terrorism: A case study on the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional (FALN)'']; Roberta Belli, Final Report to the Science & Technology Directorate, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, August 2012.
2) The US House of Representatives report in 1999 on the FALN pardons
3) A summary report by OLR's Department of Justic parole board
4) A detailed interview of Richard Hahn, the FBI agent who helped direct the task force that led to the arrest and conviction of the FALN members. He also gave a deposition to the US House of Representatives in 1999.

In the past, I have had assertions citing these sources repeatedly deleted from the article. I would like to use them as sources explaining what the FALN ''seditious conspiracy'' included.

Also prior versions of the article stated that he had not been convicted of acts of violence. I disagree on many levels with that assertion. The ''seditious conspiracy'' included violent acts, including bombings, but for most of these, it couldn't be proven exactly who made the bomb, who placed it, who was the lookout, etc. Also some of the acts included armed robbery, considered by the federal government as a violent crime. Finally, his planned prison escapes included a high potential for violence. I think this is important because this was used by a spokesperson for President Clinton as a rationale for the FALN pardons, including that of OLR. I would like to insert into the article why many would disagree in OLR's case. Again, one could cite many of the same sources.[[User:Rococo1700|Rococo1700]] ([[User talk:Rococo1700|talk]]) 06:04, 15 June 2014 (UTC)}}

Until now Half-Life 3 has only been written about on the [[Half-Life (series)]] article. As a game which hasn't been officially confirmed by Valve (creators of the series), arguments have been made that it should not yet have its own article per [[WP:CRYSTAL]]. This draft article has been created to test the waters and see if the large amount of coverage the potential game has had is enough to support its own article. An inconclusive discussion can be found at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Video_games/Archive 105#Half-Life 3|WikiProject Video Games]]. The question here is a fairly straightforward one: Should Half-Life 3 have its own article based on this draft, or should it remain in the series article?

Should the Adam Marshall be added to the list of Australian politicians convicted of crimes? The sources say he admitted his guilt and was sentenced. And there is no authority that says he received a section 10 spent conviction order which is a sentencing option for magistrates in New South Wales. As for the lack of mention of any explicit mention of his conviction in the online articles, it goes without saying that once a charge case proceeds to sentencing in that jurisdiction, then there's no procedural mechanism that allows the offender to escape conviction at that stage anyway. This is easily shown to the satisfaction of any reasonable person by a cursory examination of the relevant statute that covers sentencing.

{{rfcquote|text=
 - from above discussion, broadening to bio editors but also reducing scope of work as it's already been created and no additional template work is required.

In the {{tl|Infobox person}}, one of the fields in the template is "Criminal status."  This template is transcribed into other templates including {{tl|Infobox criminal}}.  The instructions for the use use of the three "criminal" fields is that they only be used for convicted criminals.  This makes sense since the label is "Criminal status" and is a BLP violation to imply that someone that has not been convicted is a criminal.  We have a number of people, however, that are in the system awaiting trial or out on bail or any other possible pre-trial status or even acquitted.  Therefore "Criminal charge" is a valid field label if they are indicted or charged with a crime, but "Criminal status" is not valid unless they are convicted.

I have made a change to the template that allows the same field number (that determines data order) to allow for different descriptions depending on context.  The testcase side-by-side comparison is here.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_person/testcases&oldid=616250683]  The first two persons are BLP's that exist today.  [[Richard Reid]] is a convicted criminal and there is no difference or change in his description.  [[James Eagan Holmes]], however, has not been convicted and the template modification changes the field description to "Legal status" and replaces "Criminal status" as the label.  By reusing the same spot as "criminal status", the template stays the same size and the only the labeling changes at the editors discretion.  The change is made such that "Legal status" preempts "Criminal status" and there is only one field in the template.  "In jail, awaiting trial" is the same status in both the current and proposed template.  Using the current template as it is currently, is a BLP violation and the proposed one in sandbox is not. 

This change doesn't affect existing criminals that are convicted (i.e. it stays "Criminal status" as can be seen in Richard Reid (per WP:SPADE).  It only adds an overloading feature for the "Criminal status" such that information about pre-trial/non-convicted status can be communicated without calling a person "criminal" prior to trial.  If a person is subsequently convicted, the "Legal status" can be changed to "Criminal status" and maintain the same position in the template.  Likewise, an acquittal or hung-jury can use "Legal status" for description and occupy the same space reserved for criminal status.  

This isn't a change to "Criminal status", rather it's an additional option for editors to describe BLP subjects' status without creating a BLP violation.  Not implementing this feature means that persons like James Eagan Holmes will need to have "In jail, awaiting trial" removed from their infobox.

Please comment on the testcase above [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_person/testcases&oldid=616250683] and indicate if a neutral language judicial status should be an option for persons that are not convicted, whether "Legal status" is the proper term or state a preference or if the context dependant labeling should not be added and status should be removed from existing BLPs.  The template has already been modified in the sandbox and tested so no additional work is required, just update the template with sandbox version.  The testcase area is probably the best way to view the proposal as it would be implemented.  --[[User:DHeyward|DHeyward]] ([[User talk:DHeyward|talk]]) 05:16, 11 July 2014 (UTC)}}

Note:Starting on a specific relevant article page, may need a further RFC with a refined question on some China/Korea/Japan or Song or Title guideline page after wards depending on progress. '''Question 1''' regarding English approximations of Korean Japanese Chinese titles: Should Korean, Japanese and Chinese, songs and albums where (condition 1) a clear English title is not used on cover artwork, and (condition 2) translated English versions only can be found in html sources, blogs and listings, and not consistently in English printed books, be considered an exception to [[WP:MUSIC]] title guidelines which are designed for songs and albums where a clear Latin-alphabet (e.g. English, Spanish, French) title exists, and defer to the policy objectives of [[WP:CRITERIA]] which requires recognizability and as a result in all cases base names (e.g. [[Damaged Lady]]) should redirect to a recognizable title giving artist name such as [[Damaged Lady (Kara song)]] or [[Can't Be A Lady (Kara song)]] (technically this is possible: see [[Harusame]] which redirects to [[Japanese destroyer Harusame (1937)]]). '''Question 2''' regarding Latin-script romanizations of Korean Japanese Chinese titles: Likewise in all cases where a song or album title is a romanization from Korean [[hangul]], [[Japanese script]] or Chinese [[hanzi]], then again base names should redirect to a recognizable title giving artist name, e.g. [[Sugnyeo ga mos dwae (Kara song)]]. The reason why this would be more needed for [[romanization of Korean]], [[romanization of Japanese]], [[romanization of Chinese]] is that in all 3 languages there are multiple schemes and in Japanese and Chinese schemes a loss of the meaning given by ideograms.

==Background'''

{{see also|Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC|Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Archivedotisbot}}
Archive.is is an archiving service similar to sites like Webcite and the Wayback Machine, offering different levels of service up to and including snapshots that are retained regardless of modern changes in a sites robots.txt file, which the Wayback Machine can abandon (potentially delaying rather than removing the potential for LinkRot), while Webcite has presented itself as having an uncertain long term future tied to funding. No issues have been found with the quality of the snapshots provided at archive.is.

In August 2013, a bot called [[User:RotlinkBot]], created by [[User:Rotlink|Rotlink]] began linking Wikipedia articles to the new Archive.is service. This bot was not approved, and was therefore subsequently blocked. This block was procedural, and made based on the lack of approval, not the quality of the RotlinkBot's edits.

Following this block, edits matching edits from the bot, including the edit summaries, were made from hundreds of IPs, residential and business, from three different Indian states, Italy, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Bulgaria, Qatar, Latvia, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Brazil, Argentina, Portugal, Spain, France, Mexico, Austria, and South Africa. Based on fears that the IPs were not being used legally, these IPs, and User:Rotlink, self-identified as the owner of archive.is, were subsequently blocked. Rotlink has not commented on any of the blocks.

[[Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC|The previous RFC regarding Archive.is]] concluded that the site should be added to the blacklist and that all existing links to archive.is should be removed. In few cases, the removal of archive.is links has resulted in [[Wikipedia:Link rot|LINKROT]].

Archive.is has never been added to the spam blacklist because the use of the blacklist would require the links to be removed before unrelated edits could be made to the article. Instead, an edit filter has been applied which prevents additions of the link, but does not prevent editing articles which simply ''contain'' the link.

The concerns about the potential for malware raised in the RFC have not materialized at this point, leading to arguments as to whether those fears were well-founded. An effort to [[Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Archivedotisbot|get a bot approved to implement the RFC result]] stalled, indicating that the community may no longer believe the block to be warranted.

Archive.is does use advertising. The previous discussion showed that some editors considered this to be a major issue, but there was no strong consensus either for or against the site based on this.

Based on the questions of consensus raised during [[Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Archivedotisbot]], the community should discuss whether the previous consensus is still in force

'''Options'''

'''Don't prohibit additions and don't continue removing (oppose/support)'''

#'''''Support''''' per above argument as RFC creator, the Archive.is service itself has shown no negative effects and provides a net beneficial service to our project. The site has presented no malware or evidence of ill intent beyond the actions of RotlinkBot and RotLink. Sanctions should remain undoubtedly on the implementation of the bot and spam linking as per usual, but Wikipedians using the service as an archive and adding links to the site should no longer be prohibited, nor should existing links added by individual users be removed, as nothing negative has been tied to them.[[User: Darkwarriorblake|Darkwarriorblake]] / [[User talk:Darkwarriorblake|SEXY ACTION TALK PAGE!]] 22:53, 26 June 2014 (UTC)}}

There has been a lot of discussion and dispute in recent months about the quality an article must be in order to be posted. Some have preferred higher quality articles in order to maintain the standard of the main page, whilst others have favoured lower quality articles so that favoured candidates are not omitted or posted late. This is a Wikipedia-wide discussion so that a clarification of the general guideline can be obtained to avoid future disputes.

Considering developments in Iraq over the past months, I would herewith like to make this RfC regarding adding [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] to [[template:Asia topic]] under the section of "other Dependent territories". This is the second RFC on this topic, with first RfC issued on 20 October and closed 26 November 2013 with a "no consensus" outcome, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Iraqi_Kurdistan/Archive_1|RfC discussion from 2013]. In the meanwhile, i would like to point out that [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] came into media attention and is referred as a notable case of exceptional autonomy, with high level of self-rule bound in Iraqi constitution, and hence is somewhat similar to Hong-Kong and Macau - [[Special Administrative Region]]s of China. Here are my reasonings:
*Iraqi Kurdistan holds separate national symbols and a separate autonomous parliament and government (see [[http://www.krg.org/p/p.aspx?l=12&s=020000&r=301&p=211] KRG website]), not subject to direct Iraqi Federal control (see [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iraq-crisis-kurds-winning-the-battle-for-selfrule-as-country-disintegrates-9560704.html "Independent" article from 24.06.2014]).
*The legitimacy of separate Iraqi Kurdistan's government (the KRG) is bound in the [[Law_of_Administration_for_the_State_of_Iraq_for_the_Transitional_Period|2005 Iraqi transition law]] in article 53 - "(A) The Kurdistan Regional Government is recognized as the official government of the territories that were administered by the that government on 19 March 2003 in the governorates of Dohuk, Arbil, Sulaimaniya, Kirkuk, Diyala and Neneveh. The term “Kurdistan Regional Government” shall refer to the Kurdistan National Assembly, the Kurdistan Council of Ministers, and the regional judicial authority in the Kurdistan region." [http://web.archive.org/web/20090423064920/http://www.cpa-iraq.org/government/TAL.html].
*Iraqi Kurdistan is a ''de-facto'' economically sustainable entity (though officially still under the scope of Federal Iraq), with the completion and operation of Kurdish-Turkish oil pipeline by early 2014 and construction of international airport in Arbil back in 2005. For several months already the Kurds operate without Federal funding.
*Kurdish region security is entirely out of Federal Iraqi control and KRG effectively controls borders and internal order by [[Peshmerga]] forces (see [http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/28/world/meast/iraq-crisis/index.html CNN from 28.06.2014]).
*There are academic assessments of Iraqi Kurdistan as a "largely autonomous federal state within Iraq" (for example see  [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/the_middle_east_journal/summary/v065/65.3.gunter.html review] by Johns Hopkins University).
*Kurdish region is widely referred by the media as an exceptional case of autonomy, referring to ""Kurdish autonomy" or "Kurdistan region" see [http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21604628-kurds-are-benefiting-mess-iraq-will-independence-follow The Economist],[http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/iraq-crisis-kurds-say-they-could-have-saved-mosul-9530605.html The Independent],[http://globalnation.inquirer.net/106940/iraqi-autonomous-region-now-under-crisis-alert-level-2 Inquirer],[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/22/iraq-security-kurdistan-fuel-idUSL6N0P316K20140622 Reuters].
I welcome other users to comment and emphasize that we are not talking about any form of independence of the Kurdish region in Iraq at this point (there is no independence), but about a case of exceptional autonomy.[[User:Greyshark09|'''''GreyShark''''']] ([[User talk:Greyshark09|''dibra'']]) 17:59, 1 July 2014 (UTC)}}

I propose that the articles [[Gliese 581 d]], [[Gliese 581 f]] and [[Gliese 581 g]] are merged into this article.

It therefore makes sense to discuss them as part of the history of planet claims in the Gliese 581 system, but having separate articles gives undue weight to the now-disputed planetary interpretation of these radial velocity signals.

Should the following content be included in this article?

{{quotation|[[File:Pulaski Skyway full view.jpg|thumb|Probes sparked by the lane closures are probing funding of the [[Pulaski Skyway]]]]
The lane-closure scandal also sparked inquiries by the [[New York County District Attorney|Manhattan District Attorney]]'s office and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|U,S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. The SEC and Manhattan DA probes are focusing on the [[Pulaski Skyway]], an elevated highway linking Newark and Jersey City. On June 23, 2014, ''The New York Times'' reported that the inquiries are focusing on possible securities law violations caused by Christie's use of Port Authority funds to pay for repairs to the Skyway in 2010 and 2011, using money that was to be used on a new Hudson River rail tunnel that Christie canceled in October 2010. The ''Times'' reported that use of the funds for the Skyway was opposed by Port Authority lawyers, and that investigators are focusing on possible mischaracterization of the Skyway project in Port Authority bond documents. Investigators are examining possible criminal violations of New York's [[Martin Act]], as well as civil violations of the Act and federal securities laws. <ref name="Times - probe - 6-24-14">{{cite news|last1=Flegenheimer|first1=Matt|last2=Rashbaum|first2=William K.|last3=Zernike|first3=Kate|title=2nd Bridge Inquiry Said to Be Linked to Christie|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/nyregion/2nd-bridge-inquiry-said-to-be-linked-to-christie.html?_r=0|accessdate=June 24, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=June 23, 2014}}</ref>

The ''Times'' reported that [[Jeffrey Chiesa]], a close friend of Christie's and former New Jersey attorney general, was among the people who had been subpoenaed by the Manhattan District Attorney, but that he is not a target of the investigation. He was Christie's chief of staff when the bond documents were changed to include questionable language referring to the Skyway.<ref name="Times - probe - 6-24-14"/>

During the recent [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/History_of_the_Jews_in_Nepal deletion discussion], many expressed discontent with the current title, including people arguing for deletion as well as people arguing for inclusion, specifically that the word 'history' was misleading in this case, that the article was more about Jews and Israelis in Nepal, and not about the history of the Jews in that land, which -- I think most agreed -- is unsubstantial, and limited to the past few decades. I think there is agreement that there is not a strong permanent presence of Jews in Nepal, although a strong tourist population as well as Jewish outreach organizations such as Chabad. It is likely that the term 'history' caused the deletion discussion to begin in the first place. User {{Ping|Nyttend}} proposed renaming or moving the article to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FHistory_of_the_Jews_in_Nepal&diff=614918211&oldid=614911216 Judaism in Nepal] which seems, in my view, to accurately and succinctly describe the article.

Up to now the essay [[WP:NENAN]] (Wikipedia:Not everything needs a navbox) was used as a valid argument for the nomination of templates at [[WP:Templates for discussion]]. It was used more than 450 times in that way.

Recently, after a string of nomination based on WP:NENAN, [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Aircraft]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Aircraft#Mass_nomination_of_aircraft_manufacturer_nav_boxes_for_deletion objected] to this.

In short there are two questions:<br/>
1) Is [[Wikipedia:Not everything needs a navbox]] a valid argument for nomination of a template?<br/>
2) Is the threshold of five valid blue links, created in practise over time, a valid and reasonably threshold for the minimum number of valid links?

A consensus was reached on [[Talk:Autism]], that Wikipedia's style should favor the phrase "autistic person" rather than "person with autism". We apparently need an ''entirely separate'' consensus in cases where "person with autism..." is followed by "...spectrum disorder."
:'''Support''' because people on the autism spectrum are autistic. That's why it's called the ''autism'' spectrum. The terms "autistic" and "on the spectrum" can be used interchangeably as they mean the same thing (aside: "on the spectrum" should be used less often as it is cumbersome). The DSM-5 does not recognize "classic" autism and ASD as separate diagnoses. Wikipedia should reflect the most current style guides and not use the language of outdated references, even if the content of the references is otherwise accurate.

I just removed the second image of "Treats!" magazine  (the one with the two ladies on it ).
I believe this fails NFC, specifically,  NFC #3.  NFC #5 and NFC #8.
I'll explain why I believe that, and obviously, consensus will dictate what eventually happens:<br><br>

NFC #3 speaks to Minimal usage,  specifically:<br><br> '' Multiple items of non-free content are not used if one item can convey equivalent significant information ''  <br><br> and <br><br> ''  An entire work is not used if a portion will suffice. '' (minimal use) <br><br>

One cover is already here on the page, that one cover is fine, there's no specific text speaking about the other cover, nor is it historically significant, so the 1 cover on top suffices and conveys the necessary information by itself. <br><br>

NFC# 5 speaks to content --  and yes I realize Wikipedia is not censored, however NFC #5 states: <br><br> ''Non-free content meets general Wikipedia content standards and is encyclopedic. '' <br><br>  because it fails #3, and also fails #8, it automatically fails rationale #5  <br><br>
 
NFC #8 speaks to contextual significance, specifically <br><br> ''Non-free content is used only if its presence would significantly increase readers' understanding of the article topic, and its omission would be detrimental to that understanding.'' <br><br>

The one cover is enough to assist the readers' understanding and it's omission would '''NOT''' be detrimental to that understanding. Further, there's no specific text about that particular cover.  <br><br>

In short, I believe that image fails that above NFC criterias so, that image needs to remain out of this article.

As from the several sections above there has been some debate and discussion over whether the Green party along with others should be added to the table of polling results as a 'main party' (i.e. not listed under the 'others' section). Both sides feel as though Wikipedia policies and guidelines support their side and I feel as though we need some input from an outside, impartial source in order to come to a valid conclusion as neither side wishes to budge and there seems to be no in-between option for us to come to a compromise we are both happy with.

Longevity-related biographies rely on a single notability (viz. the person is very old). Encyclopedic content should therefore be related to that person's longevity. Content such as <blockquote>She receives regular visits from friends and family. Her granddaughter, Gradie Welch (age 78) visits her in the mornings and on Sundays, she helps Weaver decide what clothes to wear for Sunday church services at Silver Oaks.[4] On a weekly basis, she receives manicures, engages in Bible study, attends concerts at church groups and schools, and does "wheelchair dancing" three times a week. The wheel chair dancing is one component of her "Sittercise" class. Weaver explains that "We chair dance because we can’t get up anymore."[4]</blockquote> would seem to not be longevity-related and certainly does not seem at all encyclopedic. Similarly <blockquote>At her 115th birthday celebration, she was said to have been "waving and just eating it all up."[3]</blockquote> does not seem encyclopedic. This sort of information is included in many longevity-related biographies and a clarification from experienced, neutral editors as to whether or not it is appropriate would be welcome. <span style="background-color:orange;color:blue;">DerbyCountyinNZ</span> <sup> ([[User talk:DerbyCountyinNZ|Talk]] [[Special:Contributions/DerbyCountyinNZ|Contribs]])</sup> 08:15, 9 July 2014 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Recently an issue of content dispute and edit warring has become apparent. User:Chealer is apparently edit warring against a new book by User:Pundit (an administrator) who has written a 2014 published book about Wikipedia whose contents are disputed by User:Chealer. However, User:Pundit has asserted that COI does not allow him to ethically intervene. "Admin only" page protection expires in 5 days and this RFC is to determine if User:Chealer's edit warring over the last month (documented in hatted section below) should be reverted for bias and edit warring, and the Page protection extended into the future.

User:Chealer appears to believe that his/her dissent against Wikipedia BRD policy is an excuse for allowing User:Chealer to ignore Wikipedia BRD policy (Chealer's dissent quotes are in the two previous sections directly above). Any Wikipedia editor is required to make consensus on Talk page prior to posting a consensus edit when requested to following BRD policy. During the last 3 days User:Chealer has established no consensus for his/her edits to the Lede section which were reverted according to BRD policy. Any Wikipedia editor is required to establish consensus first, according to BRD, and prior to re-posting edits in the Lead section. User:Chealer has resorted to making threats to file Admin reports against users opposed to h/her edits and expressing anger against Admin Tiptoety for not following h/her instructions. User:Chealer has not withdrawn h/her dissent against following WP:BRD policy, and resorted to multiple personal attacks in the sections above this RFC.  

Persistent edit warring and dissent against BRD policy by User:Chealer has resulted in this RFC to determine if "Admin only" page protection for the Wikipedia page should be supported and extended for a period of 30-, 60- or 90-days; or, if consideration should be given to protecting the page from edits by User:Chealer who has been involved in persistent content dispute and edit warring against contents from a new book about Wikipedia by User:Pundit, for a protection period of 30-, 60-, or 90-days. User:Pundit is unable to defend the content of his new book due to COI which does not allow him to ethically intervene.

As you can see above, there is no such religion as "secular Islam" yet the subject has labelled himself as one. The main opposition is that by definition, Islam is a theocracy and the idea that there could be such a thing as "secular Islam" is offensive to many of that faith. My question is, should the infobox display

Should we issue warnings to users for their username who have never edited?

It has been drawn to my attention that the advice being offered in relation to improper usernames is unclear in whether we should be warning users ({{tl|uw-username}}; {{tl|uw-coi-username}}) for their username who have never made their first edit (e.g. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Changing_username/Simple&oldid=613156018#MCPHS_University_.E2.86.92_MCPHS] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Xeno&oldid=613537849#Template:uw-coi-username]). Suggested new wording to the top of [[Wikipedia:Username policy#Dealing with inappropriate usernames]]:

;Consider leaving well alone

If the name is not unambiguously problematic, it may be sensible to ignore it. Assume good faith, and also note the exceptions in the section on inappropriate usernames. {{xt|Generally, one should not ask a user to change their username unless the user has made at least one recent edit.}}

There are numerous claims by Hamas reported by sources affiliated with them, such as  presstv or electronicintifada.
Other media sources often report that Hamas did make these claims, but do not approve the information itself. Here are a few examples:
* [http://en.shafaqna.com/topnews/item/30430-israeli-f16-hit-by-surface-to-air-missile-over-gaza-hamas-claims.html F16 shot down]
* [http://www.presstv.com/detail/2014/08/04/374002/iran-ready-to-fully-support-palestine/ 150 IDF soldiers killed]
* [http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=714871 Captured a live soldier]
* [http://fortunascorner.com/2014/07/14/hamas-claims-multiple-uavs-launched-into-israel/ Flying an UAV over Tel Aviv]
* [http://212.28.242.152/~emqw83im/essaydetails.php?eid=7393&cid=388#.U-B-cvmSyPs Destroying two IDF tanks]
* There were a few more that I can't find links to now, including scoring a direct rocket hit to IDF HQ.
Some users repeatedly insert these false claims into the infobox. I believe the fact that Hamas makes false claims should be reported somewhere in the media section, but the claims themselves cannot be used as facts since they lack a reliable source. Any opinions ?

I made this change earlier with the thought that the wording itself, which I've been planning to change for awhile, would not be controversial.  As can be seen, I was apparently wrong and have been reverted.

Should we be linking readers (via disambiguation notes, etc.) to the Wikipedia/Help/Manual namespaces from the mainspace?

I've recently added what I feel is fairly obvious guidance: 

{{blockquote|Generally, one should not include disambiguation notes from an article page to a page in the Wikipedia project or help namespace. For example, it is highly unlikely that readers looking for our encyclopedia article on retirement will want to be linked to our internal page [[Wikipedia:Retirement]]; the link will appear confusing or unprofessional, or both. Editors should know to use the "Wikipedia:" prefix, and should not need to be directed to the internal workings of the project via self-references at the top of articles in the article mainspace.}}

::Based on comments thus far I've reworded it somewhat:
{{blockquote|Consider carefully before including disambiguation notes from articles or disambiguation pages to the Wikipedia project or Help namespaces. For example, it is highly unlikely that readers looking for our encyclopedia article on retirement will want to be linked to our internal page [[Wikipedia:Retirement]]; the link will appear confusing or unprofessional, or both. Examples of acceptable uses are major policies and guidelines (e.g. [[Protection policy]]), commonly-used acronyms and shorthand (e.g. [[AFD]]), and material to assist new users with basic site features (e.g. [[Editing]]). These references should use the {{tl|Selfref}} template as described [[#Self-reference tools|below]].}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Should impeached or non accessible secondary sources be considered superior to irrefutable primary sources when references to the primary source are merely providing factual information and not drawing conclusions or expressing a point of view?  Please see section on "Correction To Legislative History".
# '''Primary sources are not appropriate in this case''' Until recently, this page contained much speculative discussion about a conspiracy to subvert the article subject, and this discussion was due to [[User:Mikcob]], who has proposed this RfC.  Since I and others cleaned up the page, Mikcob has continued to dispute niggling details of the legislative process undergone by the article subject, and has generally tried to support the edits with primary sources (e.g., the record of congressional proceedings).  Though s/he has stopped trying to explicitly add back the conspiracy theory, I believe the reason Mikcob attaches importance to these details is because s/he thinks they are important to supporting the conspiracy theory.
::Per [[WP:PSTS]], the use of primary sources is appropriate only when the coverage from secondary sources is inadequate, and it must never be used to support interpretive points.  For this topic, I think it is clear that secondary sources have covered all the ground that is of general interest (and contrariwise, if the points Mikcob wishes to add are not covered, then they are ''ipso facto'' not of general interest).  Furthermore, even if it is not explicit, I worry that Mikcob's reasons for citing primary sources are in fact interpretive.  --[[User:BlueMoonlet|BlueMoonlet]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonlet|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/BlueMoonlet|c]]) 01:50, 16 July 2014 (UTC)}}

I'm concerned about a lack of transparency in the process of choosing clerks. I accept that the recent events in my own editing history raises concerns about my effectiveness in keeping cool when communicating and I'll add it to the list of things I'm apparently not suited for and move on, the disturbing nature of how this decision is made without any visible discussion or any objective measuring of what qualities are looked for is something I'd like to see changed. For example a reason given that part of the denial is I was overeager, for fucks sake I asked two people almost two weeks a part in early march about clerking one didn't have experience and the other wasn't taking a trainee and then didn't comment on the issue again until there was a thread comment in June by someone else suggesting a need for more clerks. I'm going to be very honest that really hurt my feelings (wah I know), we are all volunteers here and want to help, to say that's the reason why we don't want you is beyond petty and it's hurtful. Ok boo hoo that aside, if we have open discussionas about admin, arbs, crats maybe we should expand this to encompass clerks, I'm disturbed to hear such personal judgements that I doubt would be expressed if it was an open forum discussed in front of everyone. Another editor pointed out on my page that it is a contradiction that clerks and cu are supposed to be open about their dealings and this should be no different I agree, for good or worse we don't protect the good RFA's from the bad ones, and those open forums can do a lot to give direction to areas that people are excelling in or lacking in.

{{rfcquote|text=
Regarding recent debates involving identity-first ("autistic person") and "person"-first ("person with autism") language, I get the impression that it is highly unlikely that the Wikipedia community will reach a consensus favoring either system in the foreseeable future. Because both systems are used by reliable sources with specific relevance to the issue, and the broader [[WP:MEDRS]] does not apply, there is ''no default''. Therefore, I'm proposing a compromise: Instead of phrases like "autistic person" and "person with autism", we can default to phrases like "person who is autistic", thereby acknowledging that autism is integral to identity while also preserving a "person"-first construction. Hopefully this will be satisfactory to people on both sides of the debate. [[User:Muffinator|Muffinator]] ([[User talk:Muffinator|talk]]) 22:42, 4 August 2014 (UTC)}}

After Elly and Ben split, it seems like Elly is now officially considered a solo artist simply using the name La Roux. As of this current version, the article for La Roux goes back and forth calling it a duo, then a defunct duo, and then an ongoing solo act, and then Elly has her standpoint article which only adds to the likely confusion. To remedy this issue, I suggest that this article be "ended" when it reaches the point where Ben leaves the duo, which would make this page defunct since they have split. On Elly's page, her earlier career as part of this duo can be referenced on her article and described in greater detail here, and then when it gets to the point where Ben leaves the duo, her article can pick back up and describe the transition of La Roux as a solo act. Unless something changes as her career continues, later projects can be added to Elly's page and Elly herself can be noted for recording as La Roux. Any thoughts on this potential arrangement?

=== Background (Persondata) '''

The question keeps arising on [[Wikipedia talk:Persondata]] and other forums on whether we should drop persondata now that Wikidata provides the same or similar information.  I usually state eventually that is the goal, but I haven't heard anything else about it.  I decided this time to be more proactive about it.

From [[Wikipedia:Persondata]], {{tq|"Persondata is a special set of metadata that can and should be added to biographical articles only. It consists of standardized data fields with basic information about the person (name, short description, birth and death days, and places of birth and death) that, unlike conventional Wikipedia content, can be extracted automatically and processed by cataloging tools and then used for a variety of purposes, such as providing advanced search capabilities, statistical analysis, automated categorization, and birthday lists."}}

At this time, I'm not aware of anyone using the data.  [[DBpedia]] does gather the information and offers it for [http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Downloads39#h283-1 download].  However, I'm not aware that they use it.  Wikidata did have two bots running, which copied {{para|SHORT DESCRIPTION}} from persondata and put it into Wikidata.  One bot worked only on dewiki.  [[:wikidata:User:SamoaBot|SamoaBot]] did work on enwiki.  SamoaBot's operator stated that he doesn't {{tq|"...recall having run that task in these months. However, tons of data have already been imported, and now it is up to the English Wikipedia community to decide whether they still want those data within articles."}}  I did [[:Wikidata:Wikidata:Project_chat#removal_of_persondata|ask Wikidata]] about persondata.

{{tl|Persondata}} does have [[User:Pigsonthewing/Persondata|many drawbacks]].  Some of which are:
# It is hidden, therefore it is often out of sync with the article text or infobox, with no current mechanism to keep it in sync.
# If an infobox is present, persondata becomes redundant.
# It is currently not being used by anybody (to my knowledge).
# {{para|NAME}} and {{para|ALTERNATIVE NAME}} parameters have no standard format.   Format should be surname, firstname, but this isn't always followed.  When a person as a stage/pen name, there is not standard on which parameter parameter gets what name.

Positives:
# If the article doesn't have an infobox, persondata can become a source of info.
# {{para|SHORT DESCRIPTION}} is of use to Wikidata.
# From [[User talk:Periglio#Persondata|Periglio's talk page]], {{tq|"Wikipedia has an easy accessible database of over 1 million people. It is data available for serious research projects. Why delete it?"}}

'''Question:''' Should the {{tl|persondata}} template be removed from all articles and no longer be used?

Okay, let’s start over, see if we can get anywhere…

'''This title contains quotation marks. When we quote the title, should we exclude the quotation marks?'''

The title of the album is the word '''Heroes''' in quotation marks (specifically [[scare quotes|irony quotes]]), or {{xt|''[["Heroes"|“Heroes”]]''}}. This is well established, as is the fact that this song is identically titled. Wikipedia practice is to keep things consistent between an article and its title, and to denote song titles with quotation marks. In this case, that means {{xt|“Heroes”}}, the word '''Heroes''' in irony quotes, should be quoted. Now, according to standard English punctuation rules<ref>{{cite book|title=The Blue Book of Grammar and Punctuation|page=61|quote=Use single quotation marks for quotes within quotes.|isbn=9781118039434|first=Jane|last=Straus|edition=10, unabridged}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/577/02/|title=Purdue OWL: Quotation Marks|quote=Use single quotation marks to enclose quotes within another quotation.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Single Quotation Marks Versus Double Quotation Marks|url=http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/single-quotation-marks-versus-double-quotation-marks?page=1#sthash.6ObRDl64.dpuf|quote=The rules differ in British English, but in American English, you enclose the primary speaker's comments in double quotation marks, and then you enclose the thing they are quoting in single quotation marks. You nest them, with the double quotation marks on the outside and the single quotation marks on the inside.|website=Quick and Dirty Tips|first=Mignon|last=Fogarty}}</ref> and our own manual of style, quoting something that includes double quotation marks involves converting them to ''single'' quotation marks, and then enclosing the whole thing in ''double'' quotation marks. So the name {{xt|“Heroes”}} becomes {{xt|‘Heroes’}} (the double irony quotes become single quotes) and is quoted as {{xt|“‘Heroes’”}} (the word '''Heroes''' in irony quotes, quoted).
Until recently, this article reflected the above. Assuming that no page move is impending, is there a compelling reason to make an exception to standard practice here? Also, is [[WP:IDONTLIKEIT]] a sufficient reason if it just looks ugly? —[[Special:Contributions/174.141.182.82|174.141.182.82]] ([[User talk:174.141.182.82|talk]]) 03:14, 9 August 2014 (UTC)}}

:The ''Criteria for musicians and ensembles'' §2, states QUOTE Has had a single or album on any country's national music chart. This includes genre-specific charts. END
:Thus, this part could be interpreted as the inclusion for genre specific charts from digital music distributors such as Beatport. Even though it conflicts with the guideline [[Wikipedia:Record_charts#Single-vendor.2Fsingle-network_charts|Single-vendor/single-network charts]], from [[Wikipedia:Record_charts#Single-vendor.2Fsingle-network_charts|Wikipedia:Record charts]], we have to sort this out.
:Here i make the case to acknowledge Beatport for notability, in regards to genre-specific charts. The motivation is to include some EDM genres, which are not yet covered at all by the current inclusion policies from Wikipedia. Resulting currently of the exclusion of entire music genres.
*'''The case''' - [http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf Digital music tracked by IFPI], generated 39 percent of the music industries revenue in 2013 (5.9BN), trend growing, especially for album sales. Now there are what can be considered the main stream genres, which can be tracked already via the classic music charts (conducted via [[Nielsen ratings]]), which is based on national country sales. However, digital music distributors are accessible via many countries, thus digital distributors of music are currently not covered by Wikipedia, since it depends on Nielsen ratings. Though, the major criticism of digital charts is their vulnerability to fake sales, when an artist literally buys sales, to push his ranking into the top charts. This is an apparant problem of the digital platforms and addressed differently, in the following the [[Beatport]] approach. [http://doandroidsdance.com/features/beatport-taking-stand-artists-sway-charts/ Beatport announced in March 2014], to address fake sales. The outcome of these affords can be currently measured via [http://beatport-banned.tumblr.com/ blogs, who track ousted fake attempts] or covered [http://www.magneticmag.com/2014/06/beatport-banned-tracks-from-guetta-blasterjaxx-and-markus-schulz-for-cheating/ here]. Suggesting, that ''main stream genre charts'' appear to be the main target for fakers, at Beatport, and that the problem is taken seriously. This stance has been recently echoed by [http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6175341/beatports-new-president-lloyd-starr-on-download-farms-what-edm-even-is-qa the new Beatport CEO], who also elaborated a bit more on the technology, affords, and the importance.

*'''Notability of Beatport is well established''', see for instance this song, [[Animals (Martin Garrix song)]], a dance track which went viral (YouTube +300M views) after receiving a BP award, or [http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/code/6214516/pete-tong-evolution-radio-show-beatport-premiere-networks-sfx-clear-channel a recent deal] with U.S. based Premiere Networks (240M reach), to feature DJ [[Pete Tong]], or stars like [http://thebanginbeats.com/2014/02/12/david-beckham-beatport-chart/ David Beckham] use BP to publish underground dance music playlists.

:The proposal here does not interfere with the current process of music notability at Wikipedia. It serves to clarify currently debatable guideline additions, as mentioned above.

The original text: 

{{Quote|CHRISTGAU'S GUIDE: Anyone with more than a passing interest in rock criticism should investigate ``Christgau's Record Guide: The 80's'' (Pantheon), Robert Christgau's collection of some 3,000 reviews of rock albums released in the last 10 years. Each album is given a grade on a scale ranging from A-plus to E-minus.
Most of the reviews and their accompanying grades, some of which have been revised, originally appeared in The Village Voice in Christgau's monthly ``Consumer Guide'' column.
Quirky and opinionated, they exemplify passionate, informed polemical criticism. Although Christgau takes the formal values of popular music into consideration, they tend to count less than the political and social ramifications of popular music.
The grades dished out by the critic, a self-proclaimed leftie, are as much moral judgments as they are esthetic evaluations.
Christgau is among the few music critics who can rightfully say he has listened to almost every pop record released, and his tastes are comprehensive.
The 18 records given the ultimate accolade - an A-plus - include the Clash's album ``London Calling'' (Epic), the Ornette Coleman album ``Of Human Feelings'' (Antilles), Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the U.S.A.'' (Columbia), Prince's ``Sign o' the Times'' (Paisley Park), Public Enemy's ``It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back'' and the Beastie Boys' ``Licensed to Ill,'' both from Def Jam Records.}}

This is an RfC to determine if the cited source – quoted above – is stating:

* That an A+ grade from Robert Christgau is the "ultimate accolade" in ''music journalism'', or
* That an A+ grade from Robert Christgau is the "ultimate accolade" that ''he'' awards? 

'''!votes and comments'''

* A '''support''' !vote here indicates that you '''agree''' with Dan56's interpretation and application of the ''Press-Telegram'' source so that it is used to assert that the "ultimate accolade" in music criticism is an A+ grade from Robert Christgau.
* An '''oppose''' !vote here indicates that you '''disagree''' with Dan56's interpretation and application of the ''Press-Telegram'' source and believe that the anonymous writer is asserting that the "ultimate accolade" refers to the highest honor that Robert Christgau gives, not that it's the highest honor in music journalism.

'''Support''' - As mentioned in my opening comments, the ''Press-Telegram'' introduces their column in the context of "Anyone with more than a passing interest in rock criticism...", and the sentence directly before "the ultimate accolade" characterization already shows that an "A+" is the highest grade in the grading scheme/range, so it's unlikely the source is referring to it as Christgau's "ultimate accolade" or to reiterate this is the highest grade. Furthermore, this characterization ties into this WP article's paragraph on accolades given to the album. [[User:Dan56|Dan56]] ([[User talk:Dan56|talk]]) 20:52, 25 July 2014 (UTC)}}

There is a problem in regard to the lede of this article, in regard to the use of historical terms, and factual accuracy. 
*''Here is a copy/paste of what I posted on the page of User:Beren Dersi'' - [[User_talk:Beren_Dersi#Arranged_marriage_-_Timeframe]].




The lede of [[arranged marriage]] continues to be very confusing. It reads:

"In [[modern era]], arranged marriage has continued in royal,[2] aristocratic families and ethnic minority groups in developed countries;[3]"

"Modern era" links to [[modern history]], which is generally understood as lasting from 16th century - early 20th century. The article modern history reads: "''The modern era began approximately in the 16th century''". The formulation of the lede remains very problematic: it implies that throughout all of the "modern era" in "developed countries" arranged marriages were restricted only to "royal, aristocratic families and ethnic minority groups". First of all this is not supported by sources and is contradicted by the lede and article itself which state that it was only from the 18th century onwards that non-arranged marriage became somewhat mainstream. Also the source for royal marriage is for Princess Diana's marriage to Charles - this is generally referred to as [[contemporary history]] rather than [[modern history]]. I cannot access the other source for "ethnic minority groups in developed countries"  but I believe it refers to the contemporary era too. Also terms such as [[developed countries]]/[[Western countries]] should not be used when discussing societies from centuries ago.

I changed "modern era" to "more recent times". It is still problematic, but I think it is better. If an exact timeframe cannot be given, at least it should not appear misleading. The lede still needs work.

The term "Jesus of Galilee" currently redirects to [[Jesus]], but the article includes no reference to "Jesus of Galilee."

I propose changing the lead of the article as follows (change in bold):

:{{tq|"Jesus... also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth '''or Jesus of Galilee''', is the central figure of Christianity..."}}

That Jesus is also known as Jesus of Galilee is not in dispute, and is supported by a large number of authorities, including:
*Matthew 26:69 - "Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee." (KJV WBS YLT NIV) [http://biblehub.com/topical/g/galilee.htm]
*"Jesus Christ, also called Jesus of Galilee or Jesus of Nazareth (born c. 6–4 bc, Bethlehem—died c. ad 30, Jerusalem), religious leader revered in Christianity, one of the world’s major religions."[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/303091/Jesus-Christ]
*Ben Witherington III, ''The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth,'' Downers Grove; Illinois: Inter-Varsity Press, (1995): p. 14
*Robert Lassalle-Klein , ed., Jesus of Galilee: Contextual Christology for the 21st Century. Maryknoll, New York, Orbis Books, 2011, xii + 276 pages
*Schröter, J. (2009). Jesus of Galilee: The Role of Location in Understanding Jesus. In Jesus Research: An International Perspective. The First Princeton-Prague Symposium on Jesus Research, ed. JH Charlesworth and P. Pokorny(pp. 36-55).
And so on. While it is true that the term "Jesus of Galilee" is less common than "Jesus of Nazareth," that doesn't change the fact that both terms refer to the same person.

I see no better place to include the reference to "Jesus of Galilee" than in the lead, as I've suggested. Including it later would be awkward, requiring some explanation. Not including it at all seems unreasonable for an encyclopedia, particularly given the existing redirect for "Jesus of Galilee."

This change seemed non-controversial to me -- but I appear to have been mistaken. Hence, this RfC. [[User:Fearofreprisal|Fearofreprisal]] ([[User talk:Fearofreprisal|talk]]) 18:01, 24 August 2014 (UTC)}}

Since {{sc|wp:precise}} keeps us from using "sportsman", there's no contest at all: "sportsperson" is over 50× less common in British English and over 500× in America. (How much more common? After spending the entire lead section of the article trying to explain the British usage to American readers, the entire rest of the article uses "athlete" 8 times, "sportman" once, and "sportsperson" 0 times. Literally the only edit needed for the page is to reverse the order of the terms in the first sentence.)

{{nowrap|<small>2)</small> '''Procedure''':}} The page was begun at [[athlete]] in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sportsperson&oldid=1252702 2003] using [[American English]]. It's fine to '''''explain''''' nuances of British usage (we should!) but it is not at all acceptable to violate {{sc|wp:engvar}} by creating a {{sc|wp:povfork}} and turning the {{sc|wp:primary}} namespace into an unhelpful dab.

{{nowrap|<small>3)</small> '''Primary''':}} The content here is the only {{sc|wp:primary}} sense of "athlete", which is currently occupied by a misleading melangerie which should be at [[athlete (disambiguation)]].

{{nowrap|<small>4)</small> '''Precise''':}} "Athlete" in any form of English easily refers to men or women involved in competitive athletics. "Sportsperson" in any form of English is a much rarer PC {{sc|wp:neologism}} attempting to include sportswomen with the more commonly used "sportsman"... but (as noted by separate editors above) it ''also'' includes ''other'' people involved with sport(s) outside of the competition itself: managers and coaches certainly, as well as managers, trainers, mascots, &c. The ''OED'' notes that British usage of "athlete" is somewhat more restrictive, but it is not completely exclusive; the ''EB9'' ("{{eb9|athletæ}}") and ''1911EB'' ("[[:s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/athlete|athlete]]") have articles on "athlete", albeit mostly on its classical history. Similarly ''American'' usage is not so lax that NASCAR drivers and golfers can call themselves "athletes" and have an unbiased audience keep a straight face. 

Moreover, ''wherever'' the page is, we have to discuss that variant usage. Better to just have the article placed at "athlete", making discussion of its classical, British, and American senses much more natural.

{{nowrap|<small>5)</small> '''Consensus''':}} Well, I suppose y'all will share your voices and thoughts too. But the page was ''originally'' at [[athlete]] and moved without discussion. Since then, the British [[User:Earthlyreason]], [[User:TommyKirchhoff]], [[User:98.155.130.227]], and myself have noted our opposition to this name with no one speaking to defend it. There is some discussion at [[Talk:athlete]] about keeping the dab in place rather than redirect to sportsperson directly, but that has to do with the British-English {{sc|wp:povfork}} currently in place. &nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User talk:LlywelynII|<span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em; class=texhtml">Llywelyn<font color="Gold">II</font></span>]] 09:10, 18 August 2014 (UTC)}}

I've hidden the macaque selfie because I believe there's currently no real justification for keeping it here other than media buzz and quirkiness. I don't believe there's an unsolved dispute right now, but including images like this should be done with care. In my mind, there is good reason to have a preopr consensus discussion on how to use images with contested copyright status. I believe this is essential both for the quality of the project and the image we project to our readers.

To those who are interested, there has been an extensive discussion about the copyright status of the image at Wikimedia Commons ([[:commons:Commons:Deletion requests/File:Macaca nigra self-portrait.jpg|deletion request]]). Consensus has clearly been to keep, and the Foundation's legal representatives are defending this. But some users have also criticized what they feel amounts to zealousness. I feel the image is clearly public domain, but I also feel there's wisdom in not acting like thoughtless copyleft fanatics. Just because we can doesn't me always should.

The [[Isis]] article is currently directed to the Egyptian goddess page by default. However, the militant group, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] is referred to in the media as '''ISIS'''. Although the spelling of the militant group is punctuated by capital letters, not all readers are necessarily aware of that. Many readers just type in isis, or Isis. The militant group's page gets tens of thousands of views on a daily basis. People frequently type in "Isis", and the page is directed to the goddess page, and readers must click on a separate link to get to where they need to go. In addition, there are dozens of other pages that begin with the phrase Isis. The Isis goddess page is no longer the [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]] anymore. Should the Isis page be redirected to the '''[[Isis (disambiguation)]]''' ? As a quick example, the [[Mercury]] page is directed to a disambiguation page since there are around three to four articles that appear to be primary topics. They are, [[Mercury (element)]], [[Mercury (planet)]], [[Mercury (mythology)]] and [[Mercury (automobile)]].

It's a little funny seeing another current RfC involving the same section of this guideline. If a NAC closes an AfD, can an admin revert the close if they disagree with the closer's interpretation of consensus and completely avoid [[WP:DRV]]? An [[user:Daniel|admin]] recently reverted my controversial close to [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2009–10 Liga Bet]], even though an involved editor already attempted to seek Deletion Review, albeit on the wrong venue. The [[WP:NACD|guideline he cited]] says nothing about an admin being allowed to do this and only states the following points for basis of an admin reverting a closure: 
*Deletion discussions must be decided in accordance with consensus and taking account of Wikipedia policies and guidelines. If you are not familiar with deletion policy or the workings of deletion discussions, please avoid closing discussions.
*Non-administrators should not close discussions in which they lack the technical ability to act upon the outcome.
*Close calls and controversial decisions are better left to an administrator.
*In cases where an administrator has deleted a page, including by speedy deletion, but forgot to close the discussion, anyone may close the discussion provided that the administrator's name and deletion summary are included in the closing rationale.
*Closing discussions in which you have offered an opinion or for a page in which you have a vested interest (i.e. a page that you have edited heavily) should be avoided. The sole exception is if you are closing your own withdrawn nomination as a speedy keep and all other viewpoints expressed were for keep as well.

It also states, ''"Decisions are subject to review and may be reopened by any administrator."'' While it doesn't state ''why'' an admin can reopen, logic tells me that the statement is paired with the 5 criteria directly above (also how it is laid out in the guideline). If it is meant to be a standalone statement, it contradicts [[WP:BURO]] and [[WP:EQUALITY]]. Allowing an admin (not even an uninvolved non-admin, [[WP:EQUALITY]]) to reopen a closed AfD discussion is disruptive and should be taken to [[WP:DRV]] which is meant for these exact situations. Also, reopening the discussion violates [[WP:TPO]] (which applies to AfD). And as a note, DRV has no prejudice against the closer's userrights. 

Final point: Admins shouldn't be allowed to judge a NAC's ''interpretation of consensus'', the community should, which is why we have DRV. 

Additional info: The admin stated ''"......I am entitled, as an administrator, to revert your NAC because it was not an accurate reflection of consensus."'' Even though it should be decided by the community, not an individual person, at DRV which states: ''"Deletion Review may be used: 1. if someone believes the closer of a deletion discussion interpreted the consensus incorrectly;....."'' <span style="border:2.5px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User:MrScorch6200|<font style="color:Navy;background:cyan;">'''MrScorch6200''']] ([[User talk:MrScorch6200|talk]] &#124; [[Special:Contributions/MrScorch6200|ctrb]])</font></span> 06:34, 25 August 2014 (UTC)}}

In light of a recent statements by [[User:LilaTretikov (WMF)|Lila Tretikov]][https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALilaTretikov&diff=9574183&oldid=9574171] and [[User:Philippe (WMF)|Philippe Beaudette]][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Media_Viewer_RfC/Evidence&diff=prev&oldid=622224757], respectively the Executive Director and the Director, Community Advocacy for the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), all WMF staff posting on Wikimedia projects in their work roles will have their work-related accounts identified in a specific manner that clearly differentiates from a volunteer account and clearly identifies the editor as a WMF employee. This policy will have full force as of September 15, 2014.  

I propose that, effective immediately, all WMF staff may have both an account specific to their work for the WMF, identifiable in accord with WMF policy; and a separate volunteer account that does not include any WMF staff identifiers in the username.

I have recently begun adding the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Autism|WikiProject Autism]] banner to the talk pages of people listed on this page. Some of these edits have been questioned, and some reverted. I acknowledge that the sources cited on this page may be insufficient justification for adding categories such as [[:Category:People with Asperger syndrome]] to other pages, or even for mentioning autism at all on those pages per [[WP:DUE]]. However, the inclusion of a WikiProject banner on a ''talk page'' requires no such justification, as it is does not imply that the information is necessarily true. The only implication made by adding a WikiProject Autism banner to a talk page is that it is reasonable to expect the topic of autism to come up in the foreseeable future, and that if and when that happens, members of the project want to be aware of it so that they can help with quality assurance. In conclusion, please do not remove these banners unless you are a member of the project and have discussed doing so on the project's talk page.

[[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Request board]] is a place where users can make a request for comment without following the instructions at [[WP:RFC]] or [[WP:RFCUSER]]. In theory, volunteers are meant to move discussion from the request board to an appropriate place elsewhere on Wikipedia. 

The request board has a terrible backlog; on August 6, I archived 166 kB of material from July 2012 to December 2013 that had remained on the request board. Due to the constant buildup of material that needs to be moved elsewhere, and the clear instructions on how to request an RfC included at [[WP:RFC]], I suggest that [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Request board]]  be deprecated. Specifically, it should be closed by marking the page as historical and removing links to it from [[WP:RFC]]. [[User:G. C. Hood|G. C. Hood]] ([[User talk:G. C.

There is considerable discussion in this forum about the inclusion of so-called "minority" opinions. Basically it boils down to, whose citations represent a valid contribution? There has been considerable push back over many months and years to the inclusion of scholarship that falls outside of the one school of thought protected within this article: namely biblical scholarship based almost exclusively on theological historical-criticism. From a broader academic perspective, inclusive of seminal archaeologists, philosophers and different types of biblical scholars, the positions in this article are challenged. Please review to assess and validate the inclusion of other scholarly opinions in this article as found, for example, at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historicity_of_Jesus&oldid=619626502#Diverse_Opinions_of_the_Investigation_of_Jesus_as_a_Historical_Figure Historicity of Jesus#Diverse Opinions of the Investigation of Jesus as a Historical Figure]. --[[User:IseeEwe|IseeEwe]] ([[User talk:IseeEwe|talk]]) 03:00, 3 August 2014 (UTC)}}

I believe the current article, the way it is, to be inconsistent with [[Project_MKUltra]]. Primarly because no one did anything the last 4 years[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_harassment&action=history], I've attempted to reintroduce and update some of the older content in main space but was interrupted while doing so by an editor who did not believe I could accomplish such article. It seemed logical to debate the deleted sections and would like to continue to source and update the deleted/unaccepted sections here on the talk page. This was also not allowed[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Electronic_harassment&diff=619619748&oldid=619619662]. While I agree the material is quite elaborate and much of it doesn't make the cut, it does deserve a discussion and I'm not aware of limitations on talk page proposals. If it is really not allowed, I wonder what legitimate method remains to improve this article so that it is more in-line with the MKUltra project?

The current sources provided denouncing the "hoax" are:

* http://www.jrn.com/kmir6/news/179055911.html
* http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011001399.html
* http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/fashion/13psych.html?pagewanted=all

I believe these insuficient to prove the imaginary nature of [[Directed-energy_weapon]], [[Sonic weapon]] and other [[Non-lethal weapon]], but specially [[Project_MKUltra]].

{{rfcquote|text=
Following discussion with my fellow Wikipedians, in which there seemed to be consensus that new eyes were desired on this article, one of our number devised three questions for consideration by the community, which seemed to have general acceptance as important matters of discussion: 

: 1. Is the Lede an adequate summary of the article?
: 2. Could the language and emphasis of the Lede be improved to a more neutral tone?
: 3. Does the style and wording represent an encyclopedic tone?

Any comment on this manner would be appreciated, as we've been in a bit of a stalemate over the opening bit of the article for some time.

I made this edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Film/Resources&diff=prev&oldid=619717603] and [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Film/Resources#IMDb|expanded the wording]] to include the following:<blockquote>'''IMDB'''
The [[Internet Movie Database]] (IMDb) is a database and website owned by [[Amazon.com#Subsidiaries|Amazon]] and contains a variety of sections ranging from its listings of productions, performers, and industry crew to areas such as forums and trivia sections. The majority of the latter content is user-submitted and often subject to incorrect speculation and rumor. IMDb does have paid staff that edit and monitor some of the site's content, but the extent of the fact checking and general information oversite is unclear.

The use of the IMDb on Wikipedia for referencing is [[Wikipedia talk:Citing IMDb|considered unacceptable]] and strongly discouraged. It should also be noted that its romanization of Chinese titles does not follow the standard. [[WP:RS|Reliable sourcing]] from established publications cannot be stressed enough. Anonymous or pseudonymous sources from online fansites are generally ''unacceptable''.

Although citations for the cast and crew and other non-controversial or generally unchallenged information regarding various Entertainment industry productions (movies, television, videos, etc.) are generally accepted (as demonstrated by many 1000s of IMDb inline citations) on Wikipedia[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&search=imdb&fulltext=Search&profile=default]), there is no clear guideline as to what information from this website is acceptable with one exception.

It should be further noted that there are two versions of IMDb, IMDb regular and IMDb Pro, the latter of which is a paid service with generally reliable information. Edits using this source should note it accordingly.</blockquote>

But it was reverted [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Film/Resources&diff=next&oldid=619717603 here] by {{U|Hullaballoo Wolfowitz}} with the edit summary, "undiscussed, no consensus, discussion clearly required;"

The previous text was:<blockquote>[[IMDb]] content is user-submitted and often subject to incorrect speculation and rumor.

{{rfcquote|text=
To be clear, what are we supposed to do when there are (at least) two musical acts who share their name (for example [[Embrace (English band)]] and [[Embrace (American band)]]) who have, both, released an [[eponymous]] album?

Citing 3 different examples we have:

*[[Embrace (American album)]], a 1987 post-hardcore album released by [[Embrace (American band)]], and
*[[Embrace (English album)]], a 2014 alternative rock album released by [[Embrace (English band)]].

*[[Lucero (Lucero entertainer album)]], a 1993 pop album released by [[Lucero (entertainer)|Lucero (Mexican entertainer)]], and
*[[Lucero (Lucero band album)]], a 2001 alt-country album released by [[Lucero (band)|Lucero (American band)]].

*[[Black (1987 album)]], a pop album released by [[Black (singer)|Black (English singer)]], and
*[[Black (2011 album)]], a rock album released by [[Black (Bangladeshi band)]].

As more bands articles are being created every day, and some of them tend to share the name of another musical act, it is evident more non-related eponymous albums may have their own pages eventually. The question is, which it is supposed to be the "correct disambiguator" in all these circumstances?

Is [[Zeitgeist: The_Movie#Influence|this section]] of the article detailing Jared Loughner's reported interest in the film unduly long and in need of shortening? 

'''Comments'''

*'''Yes''' As it stands, the only source we have in the section that devotes more than three sentences to any connection between the movie and Loughner is a single opinion piece by a partisan commentator trying to connect the movie to the right-wing. I believe a single paragraph with a summary of the allegations about the film's influence on Loughner and Joseph's response is sufficient.--[[User:The Devil's Advocate|<font color="vermillion">'''The Devil's Advocate'''</font>]] <sub>[[User talk:The Devil's Advocate|<font color="burntorange">tlk.</font>]] [[Special:Contributions/The Devil's Advocate|<font color="red">cntrb.</font>]]</sub> 23:17, 20 August 2014 (UTC)}}

The song "Manicure" is officially listed on iTunes and the back cover/liner notes of this album as "MANiCURE". According to an interview with the artist/songwriter, Lady Gaga, the title has a double meaning - "being cured by a man" in addition to the obvious "manicure" inferral. At least one reliable source notes that the official spelling affects the pronunciation (silent ''i''), though the aforementioned Lady Gaga interview shows she prefers to pronounce it simply as "manicure". Commonality in sources is split - some use the "MANiCURE" spelling; others use "Manicure". [[MOS:TM]] has been cited in favor of maintaining the listing as "Manicure"; the "best treated with common sense, and occasional exceptions may apply" portion of [[WP:GUIDES]] (and [[WP:IAR]], implied) have been cited in favor of listing it as "MANiCURE".

We're disgreeing about the inclusion of the monkey selfie. Does it relevant due to its recent notability or is it merely a form image [[WP:COATRACK|coatracking]]? It's a certaionly relevant to a unique form of copyright case (and [[animal-made art]], but the connection to this species is rather incidental. It could have almost any other primate, or even [[:File:LatabeElephantSelfPortrait.jpg|an elephant]]. It's a certainly a form of human interaction, but a one-of-a-kind example. My view is that it's not really relevant to the species, and especially without any sort of contextualizing content (ie not illustrative). As an image of the animal itself, it's not useful since it's focused on just the face and as far as I can tell doesn't display any typical behavior. There have to be hundreds of indivudal cases of animal photos that are extremely popular online, but that doesn't mean they should be in the articles about the individual species.

So does it belong here or not?

Does Westeros.org count as an expert source per [[WP:SPS]]?

Westeros.org is a self-described "fan site" run by Elio Garcia and Linda Antonsson.[http://www.westeros.org/About/]  Its content concerns George Martin's ''Song of Ice and Fire'' novel series and its television adaptation ''Game of Thrones''.  It has a long history of use in GA-rated articles about its subject matter.

They have been invited to discuss the series as "guest experts" on other programs.  They have worked as fact-checkers for Martin and as consultants for the television show.  Antonsson and Garcia also have other credentials and endorsements.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Oathkeeper#Garcia_and_Antonsson.27s_credentials_.28beyond_their_book.29]   Garcia states, however, that they are ''not'' employees of HBO and that their consulting was "informal and unofficial."

This is already an informal RfC. As suggested below, it may be helpful to some editors to make it more formal, so that they receive a notification on their talk page. Always nice to get something in the mail, and we may bring more to the party.

Briefly, the [[Whitehouse Institute of Design]] is a small private educational institution. The [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Whitehouse_Institute_of_Design&oldid=575226225 short article] (7 lines and an infobox) lasted from November 2012 to May 2014 before an allegation arose that the daughter of then Opposition Leader (now Prime Minister) Tony Abbott had received a $60 000 scholarship which he had failed to declare on his parliamentary register of interests. School staff issued statements that the scholarship was awarded to Frances Abbott on merit. Such scholarships are not seen as gifts and are not required to be registered.

Right, looking at the history I can see it was created by {{u|Neutrality}} on 4 May 2005, but am trying to figure out where the discussion for it arose.

It has no classification, so it isn't clear whether it is a policy, guideline or essay. So we may as well settle this now with a big RfC hug-fest, and folks can comment below and add some reasoning.

[[User:Mr. Stradivarius]] has consistently removed heavily sourced paragraphs and kept replacing them, until just recently, with unsourced hagiography. The following are the sourced (which he maliciously calls unsourced) paragraphs that were removed: 
 
*According to former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky, in his book By Way of Deception, the Mossad "was deeply involved with several other warring Lebanese families, paying for information, passing it between groups, even paying the gangs and some Palestinians in the refugee camps for intelligence and services. Besides Gemayel, both the Jumblatt and Berri families were on the Mossad payroll. '''Source''': Ostrovsky, Victor (1990). By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer, p. 316
 
*Berri is involved in corruption allegations regarding a 1996 coastal motorway in southern Lebanon. The contract for the motorway was won by a firm run by Berri's wife, Randa Assi, and was said to be overpriced by over three hundred million US dollars. '''Sources''': Johnson, Michael (2001). All Honorable Men: The Social Origins Of War In Lebanon , p.236; Schwerna, Tobias (2010). Lebanon: A Model of Consociational Conflict , p.128. 

*In 2004, Berri was mentioned in several of the diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks. One cable said that Amal is "near universally derided as corrupt to the core", and that Berri was described by a relative of Musa al-Sadr as having provided social services in the south only through "wheeling, dealing, and stealing". Also according to the cables, Berri receives USD 400,000 a month from Iran, using a fourth of the sum to shore up his support and pocketing the rest. '''Sources''': [http://www.gloria-center.org/2011/12/the-%E2%80%9Cindependent-shi%E2%80%99a%E2%80%9D-of-lebanon-what-wikileaks-tells-us-about-american-efforts-to-find-an-alternative-to-hizballah/#_edn50 Gloria Center], [http://wikileaks.org/cable/2006/04/06BEIRUT1090.html Wikileaks cables]. 

*According to one source, Berri was considered by Rafik Hariri to be "irredeemably corrupt and unreliable", as well as an opportunist, and is thought to maintain his support base through access to state funds. '''Source''':  Blanford, Nicholas (2006). Killing Mr. Lebanon: The Assasination of Rafik Hariri and Its Impact on the Middle East , p. 118

*According to leaked diplomatic cables, during the 2006 Lebanon war, Berri, publicly an ally of Hezbollah, described Israel's attacks on Hezbollah to US Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman as being "like honey", and hoped that Israel would complete its mission against Hezbollah quickly. He suggested that the IDF "markedly improve its targeting intelligence to make air strikes more effective. Either that, or they would have to wipe Hizballah out of the south with a ground offensive." He also suggested that "if Israel succeeds in weakening Hizballah militarily, then he will be more willing to weaken them politically". '''Sources''': [http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=06BEIRUT2407 Wikileaks cables], [https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/nownews/wikileaks_berri_pleased_with_2006_israel_raids NOW Media], [http://www.aspeninstitute.org/policy-work/middle-east-programs/us-lebanon-dialogue/the-lebanon-bulletin/syria-hezbollah-allies-exp Aspen Institute], [http://middle-east-online.com/ENGLISH/?id=47941 Middle East Online]. 

*Berri's sister-in-law and close business associate Samira Assi, is said to have made a fortune by getting a contract from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to print one million copies of Gaddafi's "Green Book". Assi's deals are seen as highly controversial, since the founder of the Amal Movement, Musa al-Sadr, is known to have been disappeared on the orders of Gaddafi himself.

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joni_Ernst&diff=621413152&oldid=621412931] Yahoo news uncovers a tape about a statement made by Eernst on [[Agenda 21]] and reports it in an article titled ''Will Joni Ernst’s flirtations with the political fringe haunt her in November?''  - The disputed material is: 
::“and described the subject of her remarks as a ”decades-old United Nations treaty that’s become an object of fear and conspiracy theories on the right.”

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joni_Ernst&diff=621399411&oldid=621270238]  An article by the UPI, in which the source makes a critical statement about the lack of understanding by Ernst about nullification. The disputed material is (my highlight): 
:: According to an article published by the [[UPI]], [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case law has determined that the Constitution forbids [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]], and interprets the Tenth Amendment as a basic statement, and not a prohibition against the federal government from passing additional laws not already [[Enumerated powers|enumerated in the Constitution]], '''and stated that Ernst "may wish to brush up on her high school civics'''.”

These are just two specific cases in the dispute, but the RFC is specifically designed to address the question if material that is critical about the subject can be included in the article, if the material is reported in a reliable source.

''' Comments '''

* '''Support''' - If we are using sources that are reliable to support material in the article, it is not our role to cherry-pick from the source, and we have to report what the source says per [[WP:NPOV]], and within the context in which the source reports it. -  [[User:Cwobeel|<span style="color:#339966">Cwobeel</span>]] [[User_talk:Cwobeel|<span style="font-size:80%">(talk)</span>]] 03:22, 16 August 2014 (UTC)}}

The use of WP:NOT#JOURNALISM has been imprecise and incorrect for years now, and I'm being bold in changing it instead to "original reporting." 

The rationale -- journalism encompasses a much larger set of activities than just "news." The section "Wikipedia is not a newspaper" is valid, but then making point #1 underneath it as "not journalism" is much too broad and contradicts accepted use of that term. Read what our own article [[journalism]] says, that it is the "gathering, processing, and dissemination of news and information related to the news to an audience." This is a completely valid description of what Wikipedia does as an act of journalism -- it is a distillation and summarization of news and information for an audience, even though it is not originally reporting info. Therefore, I'm narrowing the section on "Wikipedia is not a newspaper" down to exactly why the sections was created in the first place -- to ensure Wikipedia is not original or a primary source of such news reports. I know this may be problematic for some legacy links to [[WP:NOT #JOURNALISM]], but it's more important to be precise, accurate and consistent on our policy than to perpetuate an erroneous use of terminology. -- [[User:Fuzheado|Fuzheado]] | [[User talk:Fuzheado|Talk]] 12:25, 17 August 2014 (UTC)}}

I just spent a while writing a project page, then discovered that I was supposed to submit this here first — which I'm happy to do, since, while I tried quite hard to replicate the structure and tone of other proposals, I also don't know what I'm doing. 

Below is what I've written, for your feedback. Thanks!

'''Proposal'''

This is a proposed guideline for use of terminology to refer to people who live in a legal jurisdiction without legal authorization. It is intended to supplant another, earlier proposed naming guideline, [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (immigration)]], because '''(a)''' both that proposed guideline and the ensuing discussion are too long & unwieldy to be easily engaged with, and '''(b)''' that proposed guideline is now eight years old and has been abandoned. This guideline will, however, at times lift language from the earlier guideline.

The proposal is to strongly recommend against using the term "illegal immigrant(s)" in favor of other terms, except in direct quotations, and against using the term "illegal alien(s)" except in direct quotations or in legal terminology.

'''Scope'''

A Google search for pages including the term "illegal immigrant" on English Wikipedia comes up with 454 results, the majority of which appear to be Wikipedia articles that use of the term "illegal immigrant" outside of direct quotes in the main text — including at least two articles with the term in their page names: [[Illegal immigrant population of the United States]] and [[Economic impact of illegal immigrants in the United States]].

A search for the term "illegal alien" comes up with 453 results, but most uses outside of direct quotes seem to be in the context of legal terminology, and there are no articles with the term in their page names where the term is not being used as a direct quote.

This proposal would apply to the use of the term "''illegal immigrant(s)''," but ''not'' to the term "illegal immigration," which is used much more widely and is less objectionable (see below). It would also apply to use of the term "illegal alien," other than in legal terminology, where the term (while perhaps still offensive) has specific legal meaning. In both cases, the proposal would not apply to direct quotations.

Suggested replacements include "undocumented immigrant(s)" (especially in the U.S. context), "unauthorized immigrant(s)," and "irregular (im)migrant(s)."

'''Rationale'''

;Overall argument
I believe that the term isn't reconcilable with Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:NPOV|neutral point of view policy]] ("''opinions should not be stated in Wikipedia's voice''" and "''prefer nonjudgmental language''"), and its [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch|"words to watch" guideline]] ("''strive to eliminate expressions that are... disparaging... or that endorse a particular point of view''").

;Act vs. person

The terms "illegal immigrant" and "illegal alien" have been criticized as derogatory towards immigrants, because they apply the term "illegal" to a ''person'' in their entirety, rather than to a specific ''act''. Hence why "illegal immigration" is not being included in this proposed guideline: it refers to the criminal ''act'' itself, which ''is'' illegal, and thus is a fair and NPOV description.

;Widespread criticism of the terms

Views & norms on these terms have shifted in the eight years since the earlier proposed naming guideline [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (immigration)]] was written, and are building towards a consensus against use of the term.

*The [[AP Stylebook]] was edited in April 2013 to recommend against use of the terms: "Except in direct quotes essential to the story, use illegal only to refer to an action, not a person: illegal immigration, but not illegal immigrant. ... Except in direct quotations, do not use the terms illegal alien, an illegal, illegals or undocumented."[http://blog.ap.org/2013/04/02/illegal-immigrant-no-more/]

*''USA Today'' stopped using the terms in April 2013 as well: "The term illegal immigration is acceptable, but do not label people as illegal immigrants, except in direct quotes. ... Avoid using the word alien to refer to immigrants, except in quoted matter or official government designations."[http://jimromenesko.com/2013/04/10/usa-today-changes-its-illegal-immigration-style/]

*Numerous other journalistic entities have stopped using the terms as well.[http://www.latimes.com/local/readers-rep/la-me-rr-la-times-guidelines-immigration-20130501-story.html][http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/star-ledger_policy_for_using_illegal_in_immigration_stories.html][http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/06/8548150/ny1-end-use-term-illegal-immigrant][http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/nbc-media-matt-lauer-illegal/2014/07/02/id/580564/][http://blogs.denverpost.com/editors/2013/05/02/denver-post-style-illegal-immigrant/976/] (See [http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/06/17/illegal-undocumented-unauthorized-news-media-shift-language-on-immigration/ here] for an article on the overall trend in the U.S. news media.)

*The U.S. Supreme Court, beginning with the case ''[[Arizona v. United States]]'', discontinued the use of the term "illegal immigrant(s)" in its rulings in favor of more neutral terminology.[http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/05/opinion/garcia-illegal-immigrants/] Sonia Sotomayor, the Court's only Latino/a Justice, has explicitly spoken out against use of criminalizing language in reference to immigrants.[http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/02/04/sotomayor-labeling-illegal-immigrants-criminals-is-insulting/]

*The [[National Association of Hispanic Journalists]], the [[Asian American Journalists Association]], the [[Native American Journalists Association]], and the [[National Association of Black Journalists]] issued a joint guideline in 1994: "Except in direct quotations, do not use the phrase illegal alien or the word alien, in copy or in headlines, to refer to citizens of a foreign country who have come to the U.S. with no documents to show that they are legally entitled to visit, work or live here. Such terms are considered pejorative not only by those to whom they are applied but by many people of the same ethnic and national backgrounds who are in the U.S. legally."[http://www.nahj.org/nahjnews/articles/2006/March/immigrationcoverage.shtml]

*The [[National Association of Hispanic Journalists]] has been urging news sources to stop using the term "illegal immigrant" since 2006.[http://ajrarchive.org/article.asp?id=5002]

*While most discussion of the term has been in the U.S., there has been debate about it in Britain as well.[http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2013/09/uk-media-needs-stop-referring-refugees-illegal-immigrants]

*The [[UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] has advised against using the term, and recommended "irregular migrants" in its place.[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/colinfreeman/100227751/should-illegal-immigrants-be-rebranded-as-irregular-immigrants-the-un-thinks-so/]

The use of the term is still under debate, and it's hardly a matter of consensus — but the very fact that the use of the term is under such debate, and that the debate has been cast in such political terms, is a clear indication that the term can't be considered to be NPOV.

;Disputes on Wikipedia
The fact that the term has been so widely argued about already on Wikipedia is also a clear sign that it isn't a neutral term. See especially [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (immigration)]], [[Talk:Illegal immigrant]], [[Talk:Illegal immigration]], [[Talk:Illegal immigrant population of the United States]], [[Talk:Anchor baby]], and [[Talk:Illegal alien]], among others.

Thus, in addition to the rationales already listed, this guideline would also ensure that we wouldn't need to keep rehashing this same argument, on many different Wikipedia talk pages, over & over again — there would be a clear guideline that could be pointed to in the case of disagreement.

Thanks in advance for any & all thoughtful & constructive feedback. [[User:CircleAdrian|CircleAdrian]] ([[User talk:CircleAdrian|talk]]) 07:55, 18 August 2014 (UTC)}}

There are several countries on this list that are currently under their current modern names (ie Belarus, Bosnia, Croatia, Hungary, Lebanon, Macedonia, Slovenia, Turkey etc.) I was wondering whether or not it would be better to list these countries under their modern names (as listed above) or under the names they had during 1912? So Austria-Hungary, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, etc. I don't know whether we should go for period accurate or ease of understanding for modern readers, so it would be great to get some consensus on this, whether we should list countries by their 1912 name or use modern names, even if they aren't accurate for the period. I suppose the same would go for some cities as well, since we use Queenstown rather than Cobh, although Queenstown is the common name used when discussing the city during the Titanic period.

{{rfcquote|text=
The Format and Genre parameters of [[Template:Infobox television]] have long been confusing and previous attempts to clear up the confusion have not been successful.

The format parameter was the first of the two parameters to be created for the infobox. In 2005, a user proposed that [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Infobox_television/Archive_1#.22Format.22_should_be_.22Genre.22 format be changed to genre], on the basis that format is ambiguous. The lack of clarity about what format means, has existed ever since. A user once explained that format [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Infobox_television/Archive_1#Format_vs._Genre refers to the medium] of the show: Live Action, Broadway Play, Animation, etc. But is that actually the case? Is Soap Opera a format or a genre? Is tape a format? Is Reality TV a format? Police procedural? Magazine news program? And does the average editor understand the difference? There was a time when the format parameter [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_television&oldid=109687068 was removed from the template], but it re-appeared, and has been in place for a decade. The format parameter is not commonly used today. The template docs cryptically explain it as "the format of the show". Our reliable sources (ex: Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic) tend to lump format and genre together under "genre" for example [http://www.metacritic.com/tv/spongebob-squarepants here], where the genre for SpongeBob is "Comedy, Animation, Kids".

* '''Option 1''' - Change nothing. 
* '''Option 2''' - Delete both the Genre and Format parameters. [[Template:Infobox film]], for example, does not contain a genre parameter.
* '''Option 3''' - Delete Format parameter. Leave everything else the way it is. Whatever the format is, will likely be explained in the lead or article body anyway.
* '''Option 4''' - Delete Format parameter. Require Genre parameter to be reliably sourced. Limit the number of genre to 4. (Optional: Create a list of acceptable general genre at [[WP:TVFAQ]] to exclude niche genres.)
* '''Option 5''' - Genre parameter should only contain entries from the "Literary genres" section of [[List of genres]]; the Format parameter should only contain entries from the "Film and television genres" section of the same list, with the exception of the entries in the "Live-action scripted" subsection since they largely duplicate the literary genres. ("Film and television genres" may be changed to "Film and television formats" and split in this case.)

As I see it, there's a number of issues with this list. The most important though are:
#There is no archival / removal for very old entries - we have 10 year old bans on this list. For those who like numbers, there are less than 450 community bans on this list, of which 399 are 2 years old or older. 363 are 3 years old or older. Over half (261) are from before 2010. This list is about keeping a record, long after it has a use in monitoring the banned user in question. 
#We have people's real names on this list and seem to have no concerns about that, more than a request for search engines to not index them. The description of the bans are often not-neutrally worded, written when tensions were high.  We keep these unpleasant descriptions - such as "too unstable" or "trolling". 

I honestly believe this list as written causes harm, not only to the banned users, but to the encyclopedia as a whole, perpetuating a culture of punishment. This page is the ultimate "shitlist" collating all the people that the Wikipedia community dislikes. The banning process has changed over the years and some of the bans wouldn't stand up today - giving them all equal weight is not something we should be doing. The information is all available by searching the site for anyone with some skills in doing so and often doesn't actually give anything useful like links to the ban discussion. 

Arbcom bans are (or at least should be) recorded at the case, there's no need to record them here too. Jimbo's not banned anyone in 6 years, do we need to keep a list here for posterity? 

I propose some changes

'''Option 1: Deletion of this page'''

===Background'''

The Draft namespace was enabled in December 2013 (see [[Wikipedia:Drafts]]) and some WikiProjects (currently {{PAGESINCAT:Draft-Class articles}}) have opted to use the [[:Category:Draft-Class articles|Draft-class]] assessment to keep track of draft articles within their scope. The advantage is that it facilitates editors in a project to work on improving draft articles within their knowledge and interest to get them ready for mainspace.

'''Proposal'''

This proposal is about whether this usage should be widened by making it one of the default assessment classes used by projects. There are 3 options:
#'''Status quo''': projects can opt-in to using Draft-class.
#'''Add Draft-class to FQS''': all projects currently using the "Full Quality Scale" (FA, A, GA, B, C, Start, Stub, FL, List, NA, Category, Disambig, File, Portal, Project, Template) (approximately 1300) will automatically have Draft-class enabled, unless they choose to opt-out.
#'''Add Draft-class to all''': all projects using the standard quality scale (FA, A, GA, B, C, Start, Stub, FL, List, NA) (approximately 1900) will automatically have Draft-class enabled, unless they choose to opt-out.
For more details (including how this would be done), see [[Template talk:Class mask#Protected edit request on 1 September 2014]]

'''Discussion'''

* The Draft namespace is here to stay and is proving to be a useful place to develop articles. Currently, virtually all namespaces (e.g. templates, portals, categories, project pages) have their own assessment class and are included in the full quality scale. The File-class was the most recent one to be added. Therefore projects which have selected to use the FQS are probably interested in using the Draft-class, so I think option 2 is probably the most sensible. &mdash;&nbsp;Martin <small>([[User:MSGJ|MSGJ]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:MSGJ|talk]])</small> 13:22, 3 September 2014 (UTC)}}

What should this article's title be? The convention in epidemiology is to name outbreaks/epidemics with the 1) Year of the initial outbreak, 2) the location of the outbreak and 3) the name of the virus. This format is supported by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Medicine-related_articles#Article_titles MEDMOS]. Article titles should be based on what is accepted in the scientific community and is reflected in the [http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/obk-14-0036-early-epidemic-dynamics-of-the-west-african-2014-ebola scientific literature here for example (see first line of article)] and [http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/guinea/ at the Centers for Disease Control].

*1) Keep the current title "Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa"

'''OR'''

*2) Move the page to "2014 West Africa Ebola virus epidemic" ? 20:28, 9 September 2014 (UTC)}}

{{user|TranquilHope}} has recently been making edits to a number of edits to a number of our articles on voice actors, changing the styles of their filmography sections (specifically, replacing the sectioning we use with putting the year of the role next to the actor: e.g. "''Anime Foo'' as Character X (20XX)" (see [[Megumi Nakajima]]) rather than "<nowiki>;20XX</nowiki> ''Anime Foo'' as Character X" (see [[Sachika Misawa]]) or "<nowiki>====20XX====</nowiki> ''Anime Foo'' as Character X". The former is supported by [[MOS:WORKS]] and is more common among our articles for less active voice actors. However, the latter is easier to navigate with, and is most often used on our articles on more popular voice actors. Still, another method, as used in [[Mamoru Miyano]], is to use a table. In two edits done by the user, on [[Kana Hanazawa]] and [[Rie Kugimiya]], I reverted the edits, but now I am seeking consensus on what style should we use. Should [[MOS:WORKS]] be followed, should sectioning be followed, should tables be used, or should the status quo remain? Or is a total rework of filmography sections in order, where only roles sourced by reliable sources be included? This discussion is an RfC because several, several articles could potentially be affected by this discussion.

Should future job positions be described in the infobox, lists of people with that job, succession boxes, and so forth? Or should they only be described in article prose?

Background:
*[[Talk:Charles J. Chaput#The info box.]]
*[[Talk:Samuel J. Aquila#Appointment to new diocese]]
*[[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Catholicism/Archive_2012#Episcopal appointments and WP:CRYSTAL]]
*[[Talk:Salvatore J. Cordileone#Bishop of Oakland until his installation date]]
*[[Talk:Mario Poli#Catholic bishops do not change their see until installation]]
*[[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive847#WP:CRYSTAL_and_appointment_of_Catholic_bishops]]
This dispute has to do with the appointment of Catholic bishops, but I am seeking a wider consensus, because in over three years none has been reached, and there has been no central place to discuss it exhaustively.

In a nutshell, the problem is that appointments of bishops makes big news, and installation is not so newsworthy. But bishops retain their previous post and do not assume responsibilities of the new job upon appointment, but upon installation. So what we have is everyone changing the infobox, lists of bishops, succession boxes, and other things to indicate that new bishop has assumed his post when he has not yet done so. Contrast this with the way it is done by [[WP:ACTOR]]. An actor takes a job starring in a film, and this can be described in the article, but not placed in the filmography until the film begins principal photography. Contrast this with the President of the United States. Barack Obama was elected first in November, 2008 but did not assume his duties until the Inauguration of January, 2009. I have verified that the infoboxes were not changed, some lists were updated but it was made abundantly clear with italics and so forth that he was President-elect and not yet President.

So I am asking for consistency, please. Either change the way everything else is done or change the way episcopal appointments are handled to have it line up with the way we already do everything else. Thank you for your consideration.

{{hatnote|'''tl;dr''': I propose we rename [[WP:N|Notability]] to "Inclusion" without material changes to the [[WP:GNG|General Notability guideline]] or specific notability guidelines.}}

How many editors reading this have found themselves writing or reading something like the following?
* "''On Wikipedia the term notable means something specific...''"
* "''"Notable" is a term of art on wikipedia. It doesn't mean merely "worthy of note" or "important"...''"
* "''... it's not the same as the dictionary definition''"
Raise your hand if you've seen anything like the above more than once. Keep your hand up if you've lost track of the number of times you've seen something like it in deletion debates, talk pages or noticeboards. We've had the same problem in nearly every deletion debate which hinges upon notability and we have had this problem '''for years''' (verging on a decade). 

It sucks. Repeatedly redefining the term nearly every time it is noted to a new editor wastes time, complicates discussion by prompting semantic arguments and adds unnecessary boilerplate to many conversations. It especially sucks because the term "notability" itself is meant to be descriptive and informative. No other guideline or policy generates as much confusion merely by invoking a term which should ease understanding. 

Take a look at the text of the [[WP:N|notability guideline]] as it exists right now. What is the '''only''' word in the lede which is superfluous? Literally the only word which--if excised carefully--would not change the meaning or force of the guideline. I'll give you a hint: it's the word that ''does not'' appear in the text of the general notability guideline, which reads:
* "''If a topic has received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject, it is presumed to be suitable for a stand-alone article or list.''"
Both the lede and the nutshell for the notability guideline expend more than a few words to introduce the concept of notability then pull us back from the common connotation (and denotation!) to what we really mean. Normally we want to change guidelines or policies if practice drifts away from our stated description. In this case practice is unfortunately perfectly in sync with our guideline. Both the text of the notability guideline and the way it is used on Wikipedia invoke and then disclaim the term "notable" in favor of our actual guidance for inclusion, the general and specific notability guidelines.

Instead of going another decade repeatedly explaining that ''"[[WP:N|notable]] doesn't mean "notable""'' let's do something smarter. I propose we rename notability (along with all sibling and subordinate pages) to "inclusion". The meaning and purpose of all such guidelines will remain the same (and they'll still be guidelines). Notability becomes Inclusion, GNG -> GIG, etc. No other changes. 

''' Why is this awesome? '''

* As I mentioned above it will greatly simplify (at a minimum) the verbiage in [[WP:N]]. Look just at the lede of that guideline and you'll see how much effort is spent working around the word notable. Let's remove all that and let the guideline say what we mean.
* It won't stop people from claiming someone should be included because they're "notable" (or some other phrase which roughly means important/significant/famous) but it will stop our guidance from setting people up to fail. Words matter. We can all tell ourselves "''well, objectively it's the guideline that matters, not the word we use for it''" but how convincing is that after nearly 10 years of having that guideline misinterpreted based on its title alone?
* It will move us away from the notability wars. We no longer regularly delete things which have sources but aren't "important" as we did in 2004-2007 and while the notion of "notability" was in flux for a long time we've basically settled on guidance for inclusion that does not rely on that word in any way. Look at the historical discussions in the sidebar for a sense of the mood prior to the adoption of "notability". We were basically picking between "notability", "importance", "significance" and "fame and importance". Good on us for picking the least bad term but it's time to move on.
* It gives us a vocabulary to talk about inclusion of subjects that isn't pejorative. Previous discussions have given short shrift to this, but I think it is important. I've talked to a number of people with deleted articles, people at editathons who wanted to make articles on subjects they felt were noteworthy and people who aren't editors but are otherwise interested in certain articles being included on wikipedia. In almost all cases the word "notability" is at best a stumbling block and more commonly a reason for them to reject our capacity for including or excluding an article as a whole. I'm not endorsing Timothy Noah's whole take [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2007/02/evicted_from_wikipedia.html here] but read the penultimate paragraph (of the first page). This is '''not''' an uncommon sentiment. We can't stop people from feeling upset that they don't get an article but we can stop them from feeling ''needlessly'' upset that they're "not notable".

''' Past arguments against renaming '''

The list below was compiled by reading through the discussions I've linked in the sidebar. It's explicitly not comprehensive but I want to try to flesh out what I felt were the most common and well supported arguments and make the best case for them. 
* "Inclusion" does not cover other requirements for inclusion, e.g. copyvio, verifiability, spam, etc. This argument has been, by far, the most commonly held position against renaming and the most vociferously argued. [[WP:NOT]] and [[WP:V]] are content policies which ''directly'' determine what is included on wikipedia. Notability is a guideline which describes roughly how we judge a subject will have a successful article. Simply, even if a subject is "worthy of note" we may not have an article on them if such an article cannot meet our core content policies. Renaming notability to inclusion may lead editors or readers astray if it suggests that meeting such a guideline means an article would be included, rather than meaning it is merely "notable". 
* Renaming the guideline won't prevent wikilawyering over it. Related, fights over inclusion are often about actually being included in the encyclopedia and don't turn on the name. A person whose biography is up for deletion is unlikely to be mollified by hearing that they don't meet the guidelines for inclusion vs. "they're not notable". Their big concern is not the passing injury of being referred to as non-notable but the fact that they don't have an entry. Likewise, renaming the guideline won't stop people from making [[WP:ATA|unsupported arguments]] for inclusion.
* We've been calling it "notability" for a while now and were referring to the general concept as "notability" before the guideline existed. Wikipedia will, by its very nature, have terms which have a specific local meaning to the community and it isn't necessarily valuable to refactor those terms so that they meet outside expectations which we cannot control. We even have an [[Notability in the English Wikipedia|article on the subject]] as complaints about the term (though more commonly the general concept) have spread beyond the community.
* Describing subjects or referring to extant articles becomes more complicated with a term like "inclusion". Rather than saying "so and so is notable so they can be on this list" we need another term. Also, "notable" has the benefit of being an adverb intimately connected with the noun "notability". 

I'd like to address each of these in turn. 

First, while "notability" is not the only guideline or policy on what sort of articles we have it is the only '''inclusion''' guideline. In almost every discussion it was pointed out that calling it "inclusion" would somehow lead people to believe that NOT/SPAM/COPYVIO don't also determine when we have an article. I find this argument needlessly pedantic and dependent on the sort of hidebound interpretation of policy which we should discourage. Since we're being pedantic, policies such as NOT, SPAM and COPYVIO are '''exclusionary''': they describe what Wikipedia is NOT or things wikipedia can't contain. They do not describe things wikipedia should contain--what the notability guideline does now and what a renamed (but otherwise unchanged) guideline would continue to do. Even the language of [[WP:V]], which describes things wikipedia ''should'' include has this to say under [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Notability|a section on notability]] "''If no reliable third-party sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it.''". That is ''explicitly'' exclusionary. Renaming what is already our guidance for inclusion to "inclusion" doesn't step on the toes of the spirit or letter of that policy under any reasonable interpretation.

Changing the name won't stop people from arguing over the concept. That's certainly true. Names matter, but they aren't magic. It also won't stop arguments from article subjects or editors interested in a topic from claiming that a standard which doesn't look like our current notability guidelines should be used when deciding on an article's fate. However, we can do our part to not actively mislead people by using a term with a perfectly reasonably connotation in a narrow and contrary fashion. As mentioned above, nearly every explanation of "notability" to a new editor or an outsider starts with some boilerplate about how [[WP:N|notable]] doesn't really mean "notable." That's not just a function of outsiders not understanding the community. It's way too common to be that. At a minimum the term itself is not helpful. I defy anyone to produce an example where someone's intuitive understanding of the word "notable" helped them to better understand our notability guidelines.

The term "notability" is pretty common on wikipedia, especially in deletion debates. Policies and guidelines should be descriptive, so that's potentially a good reason to not change the name. But I'd argue the term notability is a historical artifact from our initial discussions on the subject. Even though it's nominally a term of art, it stems from our then desire to limit articles to "important" or "significant" ones, "notable" just being the term we landed on. Once we start naming guidelines after it and it becomes a useful shorthand, the term can take on a life of its own. We're no longer certain that practice drives the name or that naming shapes practice. Arguably it's [[Structuration theory|both]]. In my opinion that means we should be respectful of common use but not needlessly deferential. For an analogy, take a look at [[Wikipedia:Non-free content]], which used to be called "Fair Use" (see [[Wikipedia_talk:Non-free_content/Archive_18#This_page_needs_to_be_renamed.|rename discussion]]). It's not a perfect parallel because fair use is itself a term of art with important and germane meaning that we didn't want to convey, but we took a pretty commonly used shorthand and moved a policy page to a more clear name. For our purposes we should note that the move to "Non-free content" came ''well'' after the policy change expanding beyond fair use.

Finally, while "notable" is grammatically very convenient we should consider if that helps or hurts our attempts to be clear when discussing inclusion. "Inclusion" describes ''our guidance'', not a specific subject. We have the current notability regime because those are our editorial practices, not as a comment on stuff that does or doesn't have an article. "So and so isn't notable" isn't a super great speech pattern to have or promote. As mentioned above, that phrase or similar ones won't melt away but we shouldn't keep a guideline name that causes problems simply because it's handy to use.

''' Previous discussions '''

Unlike many [[Wikipedia:Perennial proposals|perennial proposals]], relatively few discussions on renaming notability which received significant attention from the community resulted in a strong consensus either way. Most of the proposed name changes were derailed during the discussion or plagued by problems which don't relate to naming. Frustratingly, the most well attended debates were those most marred by unnecessary problems or forks. Notably (lol):
* Many of the rename attempts were sidelined by discussions over whether or not to elevate notability to a policy, dissolve it entirely or replace it with materially different proposed guidelines.
* Some discussions focused a lot on whether or not a renaming would impact the relationship between SNGs and the GNG. This mattered a lot because the actual relationship was in flux during the time period of many discussions. It is not in flux now.
* Some suggested names were lengthy and/or unwieldy such as "Article Inclusion Criteria" or "Inclusion Guideline", causing people to oppose a rename on the pretty reasonable basis that such names were a mouthful.
As with any discussion, I can't (and shouldn't) limit the scope of comments or interest but I would urge everyone involved to please consider the value or harm from ''only'' renaming the guideline and not spin this out into unrelated issues. If you are concerned that renaming notability will ''ipso facto'' materially impact policies or guidelines then a discussion of that is perfectly germane, but I would like to see a vibrant community discussion on the merits of renaming rather than a proxy fight over inclusion writ large as we have seen in the past.

Hi all,

Over at Wikimedia Commons, there has been an OTRS userright (applying autopatrolled permission) for quite a while. Although it does little on the surface, it allows a [[:c:User:Krdbot/af69|log to be kept]] of tags showing OTRS permission added by users who are not agents (or not flagged as such). I would like to propose a similar userright (that maybe grants reviewer or something else minor) that can be used with a filter for a similar purpose. I do not have any figures about how widespread this is on enwiki, and doubt I could get them very easily without having to monitor every single use of the template. This will also allow for easy identification of OTRS agents, and avoid situations such as [[Wikipedia:OTRS noticeboard#File:Highhazelsband2014.jpg|this]].

My proposal is as follows: Create an "otrs-user" right on enwiki as well. Then, create an edit summary to pick up any addition of {{tl|permissionOTRS}} or {{tl|ConfirmationOTRS}} by users not in the groups (like [[:c:Special:AbuseFilter/69|this one]]). The right can be requested on a new subpage of [[WP:PERM]] (or requested on the otrs private Wiki, depending on how much disclosure people think this needs on-wiki.

;Specific changes to drive
#Software Requests (need to be completed by developers)
## Create a new user group on enwiki, named <code>OTRS members</code>
## Add the <code>read</code> permission to the new group
##: <small>Groups appear to require ''any'' permission in them in order to work – goal here is to simply have a group exist</small>
## Update the <code>sysop</code> group permissions <code>Add groups</code> and <code>Remove groups</code> to include the new group
#Edit-filter requests (can be completed by admins/ef-managers on-wiki)
##Create an abuse filter to apply tags using the new group as a condition

Just to clarify, this adds no special permissions or rights to any users – it only enables easy identification of agents, and shows up possible abuse of the permission system.

The article currently has no information on her birth because there is debate as to whether she was born in 1968 or 1969. Should the article reflect the ''best information to date'' from the tombstone and IMDB which use "September 23, 1968" and explain in a note the potential inaccuracy inherent in each source, until she rises from the grave to present he long form birth certificate? Having no date is much worse than having a potentially inaccurate date with an explanation. See [[Clara Bow]] where it says "Her birth year, according to US Census 1910 and 1920 was given as 1905.[9] In the Census of 1930 Bow claims she was born in 1906.[10] and on her gravestone of 1965 the inscription says 1907." '''Should the Michelle Thomas article read: "She was born on September 23, 1968, although some sources use 1969." with information on the various sources and how accurate they may be in a footnote.''' And have the same date, "September 23, 1968", in the lede and the infobox connected to the same footnote. This is how it has been handled in all the fuzzy age biographies, we even used to have a category for them. Not having a date lets the reader think that she was 50 or 100 years old when she died, instead of 29 or 30. Of course if another document turns up, that can be included when it is found.

* [[User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )]] Use the best information to date from IMDB and her gravestone. It can always be changed if more accurate information comes along.

[[User:MarciulionisHOF|MarciulionisHOF]] suggested reconsidering the people who are in the photos, not just because of potential offensiveness, but because of relevance and notability.

I agree with his suggestion in general and with some of the people that he brings up, but I can see very few ways in which we could actually do that.

* [[Shalom Shabazi]] and [[Ben-Dror Yemini]] would be excellent, but we don't have a Free image.
* [[Boaz Mauda]] is the least notable of the singers that are currently represented, and bringing people of other professions is a good idea. The one I could find most easily is [[Gila Gamliel]], whose photo already appears further in the article. It can move to the top and replace Mauda.
* Eyal Golan is controversial, but very popular. I'd argue that [[Zohar Argov]] is historically far more important than Eyal Golan is, so it would be great to have his photo at the top, but the photo of Argov that we have in the article is not Free, and this should be avoided.
* Dana International should remain. She is very notable internationally and does exhibit Yemenite identity; sources are easy to google.
* Amnon Yitzhak should remain. He's very controversial, and certainly not representative of all Yemenite Jews, but he's very popular.
* Some more notable names I could add are [[:he:גלית גיאת|Galit Giat]], [[:he:אסתר גמליאלית|Esther Gamlielit]], [[:he:רחל נדב|Rachel Nadav]], [[:he:ברכה צפירה|Bracha Tzfira]] and [[Yisrael Kessar]], although I could only find an English Wikipedia article about the last person in this list (his image can be copied from the Hebrew Wikipedia).

So the only possibly actionable item I can thing of now is replacing Boaz Mauda with Gila Gamliel.

And I'll repeat yet again, that I don't find photo collections that represent ethnic very important in the first place. Writing articles about [[Esther Gamlielit]] and [[Bracha Tzfira]] is far more important than having these arguments. --[[User:Amire80|Amir E.

{{rfcquote|text=
There is currently disagreement about how the lead and infobox should described the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR). The ECR is a political group in the [[EU Parliament]] formed after the election in 2009. At its formation, it consisted of centre-right Euro-sceptic parties; this is what both the lead and the infobox says. After the election in 2014, the composition of the group changed somewhat. Most controversial (judging by the media coverage) was the decision to take in some parties that often are labelled either "far-right", "anti-immigration" or both. This fact can be easily sourced. As shown in the discussion, this is precisely what leading international media such as the [[New York Times]], [[Washington Post]], [[Financial Times]], [[The Guardian]], [[Reuters]], [[El País]], [[La Repubblica]] and [[TF1]] have reported.<br>
Nobody suggests that the lead  should say that the ECR as a whole is far-right, but given the extensive media coverage of the new composition of the group, and the fact that about 10% of the group now comes from parties labelled "far-right" and "anti-immigration", I think it's perfectly [[WP:NPOV]] for the lead to mention this. Along the same lines, I find it [[WP:POV]] to suppress any mention of it from the lead.<br> 
In a long discussion, three users (GabrielThursday, Lacunae and Jaakko Sivonen) disagree that this should be in the lead. Their main argument (and I hope GabrielThursday and Lacunae correct me if I'm wrong, I don't intend to put words in their mouth) is that the ECR as a whole is never called "far-right". They are correct, which is why I've never suggested saying anything like that. However, my own view is that the fact that this group is not "''just''" made up of mainstream centre-right parties is relevant, is abundantly well covered in [[WP:RS]] sources but is currently completely kept out of the lead. A reader who just reads the infobox and the lead of the article will not get a correct picture of the current composition of the ECR. This is why I have proposed '''one''' sentence, backed up by several sources, in the lead to say that the ECR ''also'' includes parties often labelled far-right.[[User:Jeppiz|Jeppiz]] ([[User talk:Jeppiz|talk]]) 21:24, 4 September 2014 (UTC)}}

I recently attempted to add some material to [[WP:PLAGARISM]], to reflect the prevailing position of academia that close paraphrasing is in fact a form of plagiarism. However, {{u|Flyer22}} [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Plagiarism&diff=627611280&oldid=627605417 reverted my changes]. I also attempted to improve the essay, [[Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing]], but that too was reverted, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Close_paraphrasing&diff=627606264&oldid=627556530 first by Flyer22] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Close_paraphrasing&diff=627614086&oldid=627608654 then by] {{u|Dr.K}}. While there are many other points I want to add, the most important is this:

{{quotation|{{cross}} '''Close paraphrasing with a well-placed citation and in-text attribution, but without quotation marks enclosing the author's distinctive words or phrases'''
*Closely paraphrasing a cited source with in-line attribution, but appropriating verbatim words or phrases that are creative or distinct without enclosing them in quotation marks is a form of plagiarism.}}
::* Paraphrasing is defined as an expression of source material that uses ''different words'' than the author. When appropriating verbatim text fragments, all distinctive words or phrases must be enclosed in quotation marks.

I feel that my contributions are absolutely in keeping with the advice offered by major colleges and universities, but I'm not sure that the guideline, as currently written, represents the position of the academic world regarding close paraphrasing and plagiarism:

* Per [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikilegal/Close_Paraphrasing Wikilegal/Close Paraphrasing], Question: "Is close paraphrasing of a copyrighted work a copyright infringement?" Answer: "Yes. Among other rights, copyright law grants a copyright owner exclusive control over any unauthorized copying of the copyrighted work.[1] Paraphrasing may be construed as copying if it is 'substantially similar' to the copyrighted material. Such paraphrasing infringes on one of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner."

* From Bristol: [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/arts/exercises/referencing/page_05.htm "If you are not quoting other scholars directly, you must express their ideas in your own words: close paraphrasing, where only a few words of each sentence are changed from the original, has no place in academic writing."]
* From the University of North Carolina: [http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/plagiarism/ "Paraphrasing means taking another person’s ideas and putting those ideas in your own words. Paraphrasing does NOT mean changing a word or two in someone else’s sentence, changing the sentence structure while maintaining the original words, or changing a few words to synonyms. If you are tempted to rearrange a sentence in any of these ways, you are writing too close to the original. That’s plagiarizing, not paraphrasing."]

It's not enough to change a few words here and there and leave the rest; instead, you must completely restate the ideas in the passage in your own words.

* From Earlham: [http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/courses/plag.htm "If the language of your paraphrase is very close to the original, then to drop the quotation marks and pretend the language is your own is still misleading and dishonest.

* From Texas A&M University: [http://library.tamu.edu/help/help-yourself/using-materials-services/online-tutorials/academic-integrity/academic-integrity-3.html "Be careful that your paraphrasing is not so close to the original that it would be better to simply use a direct quotation with quotation marks. (Leaving off quotation marks is a large error, even if you have made a parenthetical reference at the end of the sentence or passage; you could face a charge of plagiarism for such an omission.) Use quotation marks every time you use words or phrases from the original source."]
* From the University of Queensland: [http://www.uq.edu.au/sjc//?page=113744 "Close paraphrases of a text are regarded as "plagiarism", just as are unacknowledged quotations. This is defined by the university as "cheating". To "paraphrase" means to restate someone else's statement(s) in your own words. A close paraphrase means minor changes have been made to an original text – for example, phrases have been re-ordered, or synonyms substituted."]
* From the University of Notre Dame: [http://library.nd.edu/help/plagiarism.shtml "Check your paraphrase against the original text to be sure you have not accidentally used the same phrases or words".]

I respect Flyer22's decision to revert, and I accept that changing a core content policy requires a broader community involvement. However, I would like our guideline to accurately reflect that close paraphrasing is plagiarism, not an acceptable form of ''lesser'' paraphrasing that passes in featured articles as brilliant prose. I look forward to everyone's input. [[User:Rationalobserver|Rationalobserver]] ([[User talk:Rationalobserver|talk]]) 18:03, 1 October 2014 (UTC)}}

<s>Editor Goethean has indicated that forty-four (44) names of "Influences" and "Influenced" by Freud are all essential to the Infobox of the Freud page at Wikipedia.</s> Other editors have indicated that this is excessive and not useful for the purposes of the Infobox. Editor ImprovingWiki has taken the position that five to seven names is sufficient.

A sentence was added a few months ago withing a block of edits by [[User:Crustypie]] in a block of edits on June 8 - "In 2012, Randi's JREF salary was reported as $243,750, and Grothe's was reported as $95,000." The source is JREF's organizational tax return from 2012. While it fleshes out a statement included earlier and sourced to [[SF Weekly]], in the past, primary sources info taken from public documents were flat out prohibited. However, it seems that the rules on [[WP:PRIMARY]] have changed somewhat, and primary sources are not in themselves prohibited. However, this still could very likely be in violation of [[WP:BLP]].

I'd like to get some second opinions before removing it, or have an someone who's clearer on policy remove it, if in fact it violates these rules or is otherwise deemed irrelevant. The article is getting attention at the moment because of a recent shakeup at JREF, and I'd rather not have it turn into an edit war.

:Here from the RFC notification bot. It is [[WP:PRIMARY]] but not [[WP:BLPPRIMARY]] imo as it is talking about the organization and is not directly stating Randi's income (as he has income from other sources such as books and speaking fees etc). Its borderline, and certainly subject to editorial judgement, but I do not think there is a policy mandating removal.

Per [[Template:Infobox person]] the name of a child should be only entered in the infobox if they are notable.

I think the above discussion has demonstrated that different standards are being applied to illustrations in different areas of Wikipedia. This is generally undesirable. All information on Wikipedia should be equally verifiable. [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Palaeontology/Paleoart review]] has set itself up as an internal peer review process that, according to its own understanding, awards a sort of seal of approval to illustrations that fall into the "paleoart" category. Unfortunately, the requirement of verifiable, reliable sources supporting each illustration is not currently one of its principles. I propose that such a principle be explicitly added and observed. I am deliberately keeping this discussion here as it is a direct corollary of the above. Stakeholders will be notified.

{{rfcquote|text=
As the Chalcedonian schism occurred in 451, would the preceding Popes not all be considered Eastern Catholics? As, prior to the definition of the hypostatic union as doctrine within the Catholic Church, the Church in Alexandria was Catholic insofar as Catholic meant the state of being in Communion with the Holy See.

Additionally, would those Popes listed as Eastern Orthodox prior to the East-West Schism, not themselves be Eastern Catholic? Again, as with before, the Eastern Orthodox Church was still in Communion with the Holy See until the mutual excommunication made by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and the Pope against each other and their two churches.

Given this, I propose adding the relevant Eastern Catholic categories where appropriate (the pre-Chalcedonian Coptic Patriarchs and the pre-Schism of 1054 Eastern Alexandrian Patriarchs). This is a relatively trivial issue, but I feel like it needs to be discussed at length before any changes are made.

Thank you

Two questions:

1. Should this dab page disambiguate (a) only articles that have titles that are ambiguous with the term ''OpenOffice''; or (b) also articles that may be ambiguous with the topic of [[OpenOffice.org]] but are not called ''OpenOffice'' (e.g. [[LibreOffice]], [[NeoOffice]], etc.)?

2. If articles such as [[LibreOffice]], [[NeoOffice]] etc. are included here, should we include them (a) in the ''See also'' section; or (b) in the main body of the dab page?

Example versions:

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OpenOffice&direction=next&oldid=622501623 NeoOffice, etc. in the See Also section]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OpenOffice&direction=next&oldid=625292429 NeoOffice, etc. in the main body]

The purpose of this RfC is to determine the current community consensus regarding a specific piece of wording: "winning an argument" versus "implementing a preferred version".

'''Support retaining "winning an argument"'''

#This familiar expression communicates to the reader the erroneous mindset that this section of the policy wants to warn against. It was chosen originally, I would say, because we are all aware that trying to find a compromise can be difficult when we start to think of editors who don't agree with us as being on the other side. This "us" versus "them" orientation can remove from our consideration the possibility of compromise or accommodation of other views. But when we stop thinking of "winning" we are open to solutions we might overlook. This is a good way to bring the matter across to readers. --[[User:Ring Cinema|Ring Cinema]] ([[User talk:Ring Cinema|talk]]) 19:31, 17 September 2014 (UTC)}}

I recently came into contact with this template here: [[Supraorbital ridge]]. I think we accept that many pages are not perfect, but that all the imperfections (major and minor) do not need to be explicitly documented on every single page. I would like to request some comments on:
# Is this template useful? It doesn't state something that can be improved (ie, need for references), but instead something that any reader could see - that the citations are not consistent.
# Should this template be placed predominantly on the page's heading?
# These templates are presumably for editors and readers. What is the likelihood that a reader or editor will, seeing this template, decide to make changes to the article?
# If an editor does make changes, will that actually improve the article's quality?

The template I refer to is this:
{{citation style}}

I'd like to hear what other users think. I think this template is unnecessary and somewhat distracting, and I think it is an example of overuse of templates. That said, I'm sure there are some good situations where it's used. I'd like the opinion of other users.

I'm using RFC because otherwise it'll take forever to get input on this. I'd appreciate some comment on whether this is notable, how this can be included without violating BLP rules, etc.

In light of the recent controversy re: paid deals and a certain video game, I've been wondering whether to include something about it. The new section would read something like this:

{{Quotation|In October 2014, while traditional video game review outlets were unable to obtain early access to the game, Bain revealed that prominent Youtube vloggers had been offered early access to the game [redacted] in exchange for agreeing to a restrictive contract. The terms in the contract included such clauses as "Videos will promote positive sentiment about the game. Videos must not show bugs or glitches that may exist." FTC guidelines require paid promotional deals on Youtube to be disclosed.}}

{{rfcquote|text=
This began as a discussion on [[Talk:Mariah Carey#Singer-songwriter|Mariah Carey]]'s page where we discussed whether she could be afforded the [[WP:JOBTITLE|job title]] or term "[[singer-songwriter]]" in her lead sentence. The term, according to the lead of that Wikpedia article, refers to:

:{{xt|Singer-songwriters are musicians who write, compose and perform their own musical material including lyrics and melodies. As opposed to contemporary pop music singers who write or co-write their own songs, the term singer-songwriter describes a distinct form of artistry, closely associated with the folk-acoustic tradition. Singer-songwriters often provide the sole accompaniment to an entire composition or song, typically using a guitar or piano; both the compositions and the arrangements are written primarily as solo vehicles, with the material angled toward topical issues—sometimes political, sometimes introspective, sensitive, romantic, and confessional.}} 

Several artists are listed on the page including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[John Lennon]] and [[Dolly Parton]]. The question now is whether this term should extend to contemporary artists such as [[Mariah Carey]], who co-write and co-produce all of their work, along with other artists, songwriters or producers. If yes or no, what criteria should constitute the use of such a term? And, if it is possible, could the decision here be added into MOS guidelines (or something similar) so we know how to approach this in the future.

Wikipedia contains many articles of the style [[Comparison of Foo]], where Foo may refer to (eg) a class of software, or a method of engineering. Many of these articles are broadly unreferenced. Almost always the features list when comparing Foo Vendor A's product with Foo Vendor B's product are entirely unreferenced. By definition these are [[WP:OR]]. They have come from research performed by the editors maintaining the articles. Often even primary sources are not offered. [[WP:PRIMARY]] suggests that this might be a valid place for them to be deployed.

I recall putting one such up for AfD once, or offering an opinion in such an AfD. I can't recall what or when. It was stoutly defended with arguments such as "But it's encyclopaedic!" not exactly policy based.

So, my question is, how does Wikipedia not apply a policy requiring no original research to obviously useful but broadly unreferenced Comparison of Foo articles? Why are they deemed to be acceptable by consensus when the No OR rule is created by consensus?

Possible solutions.

It makes sense for the talk page to be in the non-existent "Special talk:" namespace, but since the namespace doesn't exist, creating a page in that namespace defaults it into the main namespace, which would currently make it eligible for speedy deletion for this criterion if the "Special talk:" title was made a redirect.

This article could be classified as well sourced, but per the discussion above, it raises questions about [[WP:BARE]], [[WP:HOLE]], [[WP:CARES]], [[WP:WTH]] and more notability issues, especially since every local company, prominent or not in America does not have an article. I think that everything about this article needs to be examined. Thank you. --[[User:Dekema2|Dekema2]] ([[User talk:Dekema2|talk]]) 18:56, 22 October 2014 (UTC)}}

Does WatchersOnTheWall.com count as an expert source per [[WP:SPS]]?

Despie being a "fan site" WatchersOnTheWall has a number of writers that are dedicated to finding out information about the show. The shows writers have a number of inside sources within the show who can provide reliable information. In fact, the large casting call for season 5 which listed the call sheets for characters such as Doran Martell was discovered by the writers of WatchersOnTheWall (although this was actually published on Winteriscoming.net, but it was nevertheless by the same writers). Bryan Cogman has both commented on articles on the site, and been interviewed.

Moreover, the site Winteriscoming.net has been often cited on other articles. The writers of Watchers originated on Winteriscoming.net, and they are all but name the same site (Winteriscoming.net is now effectively a new site after being bought out, and having new writers instated.)

Should the lead section of this article include the name Miladin?

The existence of the name as a birth name is verifiable, but in a very small number of sources.
It's not verified that it's still the person's proper name today.

Because this is a [[WP:BLP]], and this is a Croatian/Serbian nationalist talking point of practically no relevance to the average English reader, I'd prefer it if we keep the claim in the first section where it's possible to reasonably assume that it is appropriate.

This has been in the air for about eight years now, and little has changed, except that I've been subjected to various kinds of abuse by proponents of the opposite theory, so I'm looking for more outside input because it seems like I'm tilting at the windmills here. Thank you.

The lead of [[David Miliband]] makes mention of both his notable brother and notable father, but the lead of [[Ed Miliband]] omits any mention of the father, [[Ralph Miliband]]. Should the sentence 'He is the younger son of the late Marxist theorist Ralph Miliband.' be reinstated to the lead of the article, as it is at [[David Miliband]]?

'''Support inclusion.''' [[Ralph Miliband]] is an important figure, both independently and in relation to Ed Miliband. It is standard to include notable close relations in the lead of articles, as many other articles, including [[David Miliband]], attest.

This RFC should apply to multiple articles, specifically [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Fran Townsend]] and [[Ted Poe]]. The articles in question were initially removed due to a legitimate point about them being written in a NNPOV. They were revised to be more neutral. They were subsequently removed stating that the sources were not reliable. They were revised to include more reliable sources. This pattern persisted. I then began to include a section that legitimately is using unreliable sources (political opposition group of the MEK) that I copy pasted from an article that was considered acceptable. You can see it in the last revision of Tom Ridge's page prior to my addition. Furthermore, the title of the section includes NNPOV by referencing the organization as "terrorist" (in quotes), when there is little objective question that at various points in the organizations past the group engaged in terrorism and was listed by the US State Department as a foreign terrorist organization.

The persons removing the articles find those additions to be well-sourced and neutral despite that they are quite obviously neither. The sections are being removed with complaints that are using technical loopholes of the WP process to further the political agenda to suppress the information about several US politicians and officials questionable support of a formerly listed FTO. 

I am more than happy to edit or revise content to make it more palatable, however, it seems clearly evident that the issue is not my content or any of the cited rationales as the content that is being reverted more clearly fits the criteria mine is being removed on.

I've put this here to try and stimulate some discussion on the above.

This issue relates to the presence of the FP1 drivers in the team and driver table of season articles, such as [[2014 Formula One season]]. The question is to whether or not they should continue to be included.

The arguments for are as follows:
* FP1 drivers participate in sessions officially sanctioned by the [[FIA]] as part of a Grand Prix weekend.
* FP1 drivers play a vital role in carrying out a team's pre-race testing procedures.

The arguments against are:
* FP1 drivers only take part in a single session of a weekend (and sometimes they only take part for 30 minutes). No championship points are offered for this.
* In order to enter a race, a driver must either take part in FP3 ''or'' qualifying, as per the sporting regulations. Drivers who only enter FP1 cannot enter the race unless they are designated race drivers by the team, in which case they would be included under the "race drivers column".
* FP1 drivers cannot affect the championship outcome unless they are redesignated as race drivers. Their participation would therefore be better suited to team, car, race and personal articles rather than season articles. 
* Although FP1 drivers do play a role within a team in establishing car set-up, this role cannot be quantified. FP1 drivers also take part in sessions for different reasons; an example of this is Max Verstappen, who is driving to gain experience in a Formula 1 car.

I will leave it to proponents in favour of keeping the column to outline their arguments more fully. [[User:Prisonermonkeys|Prisonermonkeys]] ([[User talk:Prisonermonkeys|talk]]) 03:05, 30 September 2014 (UTC)}}

But a joke without context fits nowhere. As it is, the '''Personal life''' and '''Political views''' sections, (his political views are part of his "Personal life,") have over 40% more words than the '''Career''' sections, which creates a [[Tabloid journalism|'''tabloid''']] impression.

On the other hand, sometimes they are at Help:Talk:Special:Foo, so it's not even consistent. In my view, this should instead be Special talk:Foo, and Special:Foo should have a discussion tab just like any other page.

I've been thinking about this for a while. I'd like to propose two relatively minor changes to RfPP that will make the page much easier to use for admins:
#'''Have the newest requests placed at the ''bottom'' of the relevant section'''. This is the way every other noticebaord works, and it means that when an admin comes along, they see the oldest requests first. Much more importantly, from my perspective, though, is that it will prevent section numbers from changing while an admin is Working through the backlog. At the moment, if there are requests for page X and page Y and I answer the request for X and come to edit the request for Y, if a request for Z comes in before I've saved the page, my response ends up in the wrong section ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&diff=624583781&oldid=624583296 example]).
#'''Remove the template from section headers'''. Currently, requests are in the form of  <nowiki>===={{la|foo}}====//*Temporary semi-protection: persistent vandalism</nowiki>. This makes navigation around the page a real pain, especially when there are 20 or 30 outstanding requests. I'd like to change this to <nowiki>====Foo====//{{la|foo}}//*Temporary semi-protection: persistent vandalism</nowiki>. That means the section header will be the same in edit mode as when it's displayed, and so the software will return you to the section you just edited after saving the page. It also means (as minor side benefits) that the section links in edit summaries will work properly, that it's easier to link to sections, and that links to sections can be previewed in [[WP:POPUPS|Popups]] (I know not everyone uses it, but I can't live without it!).
What do other people (particularly admins who regularly handle requests here) think of this? Courtesy ping for [[User:Cyberpower678|Cyberpower]], who can tell us whether it would be practical to change his excellent bot to cope with the new format (I'll notify [[WT:Twinkle]], as well).

The intro to the history section presents doctrine (or the Catholic church's view of its history) without counterpoint or historicity comment. Currently the two paragraph intro contains only POV Catholic doctrinal statements, generally beginning with "the Church teaches," suited better for a doctrine section than a history section. I have suggested, at the least, that some counterpoint (three prominent secular history scholars, that I've cited, and a religious authority from another church, also cited) be included to render the presentation NPOV. My suggested text for insertion at the end of the second paragraph (after being corrected by comments from another editor) is only two sentences. It reads,

The [[History of the Catholic Church]] article begins by presenting doctrine (or the Catholic church's view of its history) without any counterpoint or comment on historicity. Currently the entire first paragraph contains only POV Catholic doctrinal statements, generally beginning with "the Church teaches." This seems to belong in a "doctrine of the Catholic church" section, not the intro of a balanced history article. I have suggested, at the least, that some counterpoint (three prominent secular history scholars, that I've cited, and a religious authority from another church, also cited) be included to give some balance and render the presentation NPOV. My suggested text for insertion at the end of the intro paragraph (after being corrected by comments from another editor) reads,

Should the article [[2014 Isla Vista killings]] be included in the category "Violence against men in North America" which is a subcategory of "Violence against men".  The category is described here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Violence_against_men]"
*'''No''' – The article [[2014 Isla Vista killings]] should not be in category Violence against men because RS have not described [[Elliot Rodger]]'s killing spree as a gender based attack against men. Please see lengthy discussion at the top of this talk page for full discussion, including how quotes taken out of RS to support including this category constitute [[WP:Original Research]], because the wikipedia editors concluded these quotes mean it was gender based violence against men, but if you read the sources, it becomes apparent the RS commentators did not come to the conclusion Rodger's killing spree was a gender based attack on men. Also, the article has never been stable with this category. Its addition has resulted in multiple edit wars resulting in the article being locked down by admins multiple times.--[[User:BoboMeowCat|BoboMeowCat]] ([[User talk:BoboMeowCat|talk]]) 00:50, 14 October 2014 (UTC)}}

This dispute (which you can read directly above) concerns whether an image of an incident involving American singer Beyoncé should feature in the lead of the [[lip sync]] article. The incident is the singer's live performance of the American national anthem during the second inaugration of President Obama. News organisations reported that the singer lip synced her performance; she later clarified in a press conference that she sung with a pre-recorded track.

;Discussion
As I've explained above, I think lip syncing and singing with a pre-recorded track are sufficiently different practices within the music industry. This article, which concerns the former, is where a singer does not sing, but pretends to sing to give the effect of singing. I looked at some dictionary definitions which state it is to "[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/lip-syn '''move the lips silently''' in synchronization with a pre-recorded soundtrack (Oxford)]"; "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lip-synch '''to pretend to sing''' or say in synchronization with recorded sound (Merriam Webster)]" or "[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/lip-synch '''pretend to be singing them when in fact they are just moving their lips''' (Cambridge)]". At a press conference, Beyoncé was pressed to confirm to a CBS reporter whether she sung: "[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1301/31/cnr.14.html FUTTERMAN (CBS): "So, you actually were singing and the prerecorded track was being played, as well?" BEYONCE: "Yes."] This is the practice of using a [[backing track]]: "an audio or MIDI recording that musicians play or sing along to in order to add parts to their music which would be impractical to perform live."

The key distinction here is whether someone is singing. I think it's clear from the dictionary definitions (and even other sources) that lip syncing is a clearly-defined practice, one where someone ''pretends'' to sing and not where someone actually ''is'' singing (albeit, accompanied in this incident). I don't think we should be using a picture of an incident in the lead of an article that does not actually represent what it seeks to describe. The lead of an article is arguably meant to be an article's most accessible part: where we set out exactly what something is. I don't think it's best to be using misleading examples, especially when the incident referred to in the image is not mentioned at any point in the article.

The RFC/U process also is too often inconsistent, in that the stated objective of the certifiers is usually to persuade the subject editor to be more flexible, but the RFC/U is a process that promotes defensiveness, not flexibility, and typically the real objective of the RFC/U is not to change the behavior of the subject editor, but to restrict the editing privileges.

===RFC: Disambiguating PoK'''

There's a disagreement specifically about whether [[Pakistan-occupied Kashmir]] should be redirected here or should it be a dab page. As of status quo, this page was a redirect to this article. But amidst this discussion, {{u|Kautilya3}} created a dab out of it [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pakistan-occupied_Kashmir&diff=633952285&oldid=532575994]. I have reverted it back for now [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pakistan-occupied_Kashmir&diff=next&oldid=633952285] so that we can achieve a clearer consensus about what [[WP:DABCONCEPT]] says about it. My initial position was also of a dab a few years back about Pakistan-administered Kashmir but an uninvolved user from a wikiproject, {{u|BD2412}}, [[Talk:Pakistan-administered_Kashmir#WP:DABCONCEPT|changed my mind and we redirected]] it and ''eventually'' to [[Talk:Pakistan-administered_Kashmir#Redirect_to_Azad_Kashmir|this article as primary topic]] and that was the end of the issue. Now a new user opened the Pandora's box again and I am using the same argument as BD2412 for PoK that to have a dab, we need it to be a name with one-to-many targets like [[Mercury (planet)]] and [[Mercury (car)]] and not a POV name that refers to the whole combined area of two territories in control of Pakistan; [[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] (Azad Kashmir and GB were combined until 1970s when Pakistan split them, and that may need a section in this article, where as India alone continues to call them both as Pakistan occupied Kashmir in its POV), instead it should be redirected here where it is explained in the lede ''neutrally'' that it is Pakistan-administered / controlled Kashmir (which is synonymous to Indian POV usage of occupied as it is for Pakistan's usage for [[Indian-occupied Kashmir]] which redirects to its primary article) . Other than the dab discussion, our policy related consensus was a discussion in progress towards some clear decision making on whether or not to using POV terms in lede (seemingly bent towards status quo), but in case of this dab, Kautilya3 has claimed [[WP:IAR]] although it does not make sense according to me. Your input would be welcomed on whether to create a dab page or to keep it redirected here and continue the above discussion. --<span style="text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml">[[User:TopGun|<b style="color:#060">lTopGunl</b>]] ([[User talk:TopGun|<b style="color:#000">talk</b>]])</span> 13:37, 16 November 2014 (UTC)}}

Another Wikipedian insists on having this article at a higher importance than it needs to be for certain projects; see this edit: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AThe_Powerpuff_Girls&action=historysubmit&diff=634140642&oldid=634140547] I object to this because this show was a fad. A fad is a show or other material good or such that was very popular for a very brief period, as is the case with The Powerpuff Girls show. The show seems to have been very popular, mostly in the year 2000, but not so much after that. The feature film based on the series, released in 2002, did poorly, thus supporting the fact that this was a fad. Fads deserve to be of lesser importance than those things that have more lasting power, such as shows like SpongeBob SquarePants and Scooby-Doo.

Looking through all the pages associated with this page, I do not believe that this process is of much worth as it was before. Rarely has this method to decide if an administrator should have their "bit" removed been used. AORs have only happened twenty six times since its inception. The most recent was made was in 2012, [[Wikipedia:Administrators_open_to_recall/Past_requests#Courcelles|which resulted in it being failed]]. With a process that currently has roughly 180 editors taken part in this, [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators open to recall|according to this category]], one would think it would be used a bit more often. Though with the details that the process is "voluntary and non-binding" and "administrators can change their recall criteria, decline participation in the process, or disregard the outcome of recall proceedings", there's a sense that there's a lack of it being impactful. Sure people have resigned in some of these recalls. But if the process hasn't been used for the past two years, how long do we wait for the next one to happen? 

So this raises the question: Should Administrators open to recall be closed and marked historical?

As of November 1st, the following twelve cities have official been renamed:  [[Bangalor]], [[Belgaum]], [[Bellary]], [[Bijapur]], [[Chikmagalur]], [[Gulbarga]], [[Hospet]], [[Hubli]], [[Mysore]], [[Mangalore]], [[Shimoga]], [[Tumkur]].   This is has not been uncommon over the past 50 years as cities and states have been renamed (see [[Renaming of cities in India]]).  The two most common reasons for renaming is (1)  Changing from British English to Indian English, with an example of Calcutta changing to [[Kolkata]]. (2) Official Indian English name changed to what it is known in the local language, with  and example of Madras State changing to [[Tamil Nadu]].

With most of the past recent changes, including the latest twelve, confusion and questions arise as to what to call an article's name, the new one or keep with the old one?


The two opposing camps come down to the following arguments:
* Keep old name:  Per [[WP:COMMONNAME]], {{tq|some topics have multiple names, and this can cause disputes as to which name should be used in the article's title. Wikipedia prefers the name that is most commonly used (as determined by its prevalence in reliable English-language sources) as such names will be the most recognizable and the most natural. This is often referred to using the Wikipedia short cut term: "COMMONNAME".}}
* Use new name:  Per [[WP:ENGVAR]],specifically, [[MOS:TIES]], {{tq|An article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation should use the English of that nation.}}
* Use new name:  Per [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/India-related_articles#Basic India conventions|Manual of Style/India-related articles]], {{tq|Use only Indian English spellings as per the guidelines for India related pages.}}


The two most recent name changes were in 2011 with the city of Orissa renamed to [[Odisha]] and Union territory of Pondicherry renamed to [[Puducherry]].  The talk discussion for the renaming of Puducherry is [[Talk:Puducherry#Requested move January 2013|here]] and Odisha's is [[Talk:Odisha#Requested move|here]].  In both cases, it came down to COMMONNAME vs ENGVAR. 

I've noticed in all the discussion contain that [[Ganges]] is not the official name of the river, it is Ganga.  It was asked in both Puducherry's and Odisha's talk discussion, so read there first as it may or may not answer your question.  Somebody was [[Wikipedia:Whacking with a wet trout|Trouted]] in the section about the Ganges.  Before you ask, yes trout is found in the streams around [[Ganges|Ganges, <small>(Canada)</small>]].


The following questions I bring up for the RFC
# For the most recent renamed twelve cities, should the article's title be the old or new name?
# Most likely, cities will be renamed in the future.  As as happened in the past and is currently happening, discussion will rage on what to do.  Should a policy be established for future name changes?

I'm posting this here as follow-up to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29/Archive_114#Move_pronunciations.2C_other_names_and_other_language_names_from_lead_to_a_note_or_sidebox this discussion] at the [[WP:Village Pump (proposals)|Village Pump]] (now archived) regarding the use of parenthetical information in leads of articles on geographic places. There was a strong consensus there that parenthetical pronunciations and alternative names overload the lead and seriously hinder the readability of these articles, and that we should revise our guidance such that we recommend ''against'' including this information in the lead section (recommendations and examples were discussed in the original thread, please see there for more info). There was not a strong consensus, however, about where the information should be moved; either an infobox or an "alternative names" section of the article were discussed.

I propose that the Village Pump proposal be extended to apply to all articles, not just those on geographic places. As a recommendation, only certain specific information should be included in parentheses, such as:
*a person's date of birth & death, if known, ''not'' their age
*''one'' English translation, if the article title is in a foreign language and there is a notable English name (e.g. ''[[Las Meninas]]''), or include an English translations section if there are more than one notable translations
*an organism's scientific name, or its common name if the article title is the scientific name and there is only one, otherwise include a common names section
Otherwise, in the interest of readability, other relevant information is better off included elsewhere. In particular, pronunciations should not be included in prose at all - they would be better off in an infobox where readers could access them without breaking up the readability of the lead. I like the idea of foreign language names being listed in the main infobox, but they could be moved to an alternative names or foreign language names section just as easily, improving the lead.

Here are some examples in my userspace (I will [[WP:CSD#G7|G7]] them when this closes): [[User:Ivanvector/Hebron]] <small>([[Hebron|compare]])</small>, [[User:Ivanvector/Chernivtsi Oblast]] <small>([[Chernivtsi Oblast|compare]])</small>, [[User:Ivanvector/Inuit]] <small>([[Inuit|compare]])</small>, [[User:Ivanvector/Coup d'état]] <small>([[Coup d'état|compare]])</small>

I am aware that the choice of place names and article titles can be controversial, and I expect that disputes regarding naming will be settled by local consensus or our other processes. I also expect that the choice between infobox or separate section will be on a case-by-case basis, and there may be other appropriate solutions in some cases. With this proposal I am interested only in decluttering the lead, not in taking sides in any active disputes. I look forward to your comments.

This is a controversial article which deals with very specific [[WP:BLP]] topics, but is plagued with substandard sourcing.  There is really no need to have 153 sources detailing the minutia of the controversy.  I suggest removing all the sources labeled as op-eds, and all of the gaming press sources.  That would leave mainstream outlets like the BBC, public radio, PBS, The New Yorker, Slate, The New York Times, The Independent, The Boston Globe, Le Monde, Salon, CNN, Mother Jones, The Guardian, Wired, Time, LA Times etc, so long as the sources were not to their editorial page.  This would mean removing sources like Venture Beat, Ars Technica, IGN, Polygon, The Daily Dot, Kotaku, PC Magazine, The Verge, Gamespot, Gameindustry.biz, Re/code, Eurogamer, etc...

'''The question of the RfC''': ''Shall we limit the sourcing of this article to mainstream secondary sources, removing <strike>all</strike> niche game journalism sources, niche tech journalism sources, opinion/editorials columns, and personal blogs?''

We just don't need to use niche publications to create an article for this topic. [[User:Aprock|aprock]] ([[User talk:Aprock|talk]]) 19:27, 11 November 2014 (UTC)}}

This article seems to me to have several issues that I have been trying to address but there seems to be too much [[WP:OWN]] to want to change it among some editors. See the many discussions above about certain issues. Some points I think really need comment on: The ordering of the cast is haphazard and inconsistent. If [[WP:TVCAST]] is not going to be used, some other criteria should be used to keep the ordering with some internal consistency. There is an uncredited roles are listed in the main cast with only citations to a [[WP:UGC|personal page]]. The entire cast section is redundant since there is a [[List of Person of Interest characters]] article that already exists. The Reese and Finch descriptions are way too long since they both have full articles. Attempts at minor fixes lead to reverting, I would like some outside comments on how to go aobut making the more major changes as well to make this a good series of articles.[[User:AbramTerger|AbramTerger]] ([[User talk:AbramTerger|talk]]) 01:49, 24 October 2014 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
With DC Comics' reintroduction of "Captain Marvel" as part of their "New 52" revamp in 2012, he was officially renamed "Shazam", a name that is used not only in the comics but in the character's subsequent appearances in animated productions such as ''[[Justice League: War]]'' and ''[[DC Nation]]'' (''[[Young Justice]]'', already in production when the change was made, uses the previous version and moniker of Captain Marvel) and in video games such as ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. As a result, for the last two years, the lead and infobox for this article have been in a constant state of flux; I have seen each of the following as the lead sentence - back and forth - over the years:
:'''''Captain Marvel''', is a fictional superhero who appears in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]].''
:'''''Captain Marvel''', also known as '''Shazam''', is a fictional superhero who appears in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]].''
:'''''Shazam''', also known as '''Captain Marvel''', is a fictional superhero who appears in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]].''

The infobox as well has been in a constant state of flux - attempts have been made to acknowledge both names - i.e. "Shazam (Captain Marvel)" - in the header, but this again has been constantly edited back and forth, often without attribution.

Now, I understand that a lot of comic book fans are upset at the renaming and redesign of the character, but [[NPOV|personal biases should not play into soft-sell edit wars such as this]]. I think it would be best to find an acceptable way to present both names that can be stuck to, acknowledging this character's 70-year history as "Captain Marvel" and his future appearances in most incarnations going forward for the time being as "Shazam" (I understand that he will appear as Captain Marvel, ''not'' Shazam, in the upcoming - and long delayed - ''[[Multiversity]]'' miniseries). Having the wording change every time I click this article for no other reason than personal preference is not acceptable. Discussion may also need to be extended to the picture used in the infobox, an [[Alex Ross]] [[:File:Captainmarvel.JPG|depiction of Captain Marvel circa 2000]] (that I originally uploaded) versus [[:File:Justice_League_0_Shazam_Alt_Cover.jpg|what Shazam looks like today]], as to whether this needs to be updated or left alone.

This issue may also affect the naming of the article itself - that is, whether or not it needs to be renamed "[[Shazam (DC Comics)]]" or "[[Shazam! (DC Comics)]]" - and also what to do with [[Shazam (character)]], which redirects to [[Shazam (wizard)]], the article about the hero's benefactor (who is still apparently also named "Shazam" in his new incarnation). --[[User:FuriousFreddy|FuriousFreddy]] ([[User talk:FuriousFreddy|talk]]) 20:12, 25 October 2014 (UTC)}}

Should people like [[Leehom Wang]], who are ethnically Chinese but who grew up speaking another language (in this case English) and only learned Chinese as adults, be included in the list of "notable non-native speakers of Chinese"? Previous discussion between two editors (and one 3O editor) is in the preceding section. From the discussion above, one view is that they should because they are indeed non-native speakers, and one view is that they should not because the list would get long. Discussion has become circular so I am requesting comment from outsiders to avoid an edit war happening. <b class="IPA">[[Special:Contributions/Rjanag|r<font color="#8B0000">ʨ</font>anaɢ]]</b>&nbsp;([[User talk:Rjanag|talk]]) 03:14, 26 October 2014 (UTC)}}

I don't see any clear consensus for any one alternative in the archived RfC. Asked to choose between a very long and a very short list of names, people naturally also suggested various compromises, using the "hide" option, etc. It's difficult to fit those suggestions onto a procrustes bed of long vs short list of names, in fact imposing a consensus on this variety seems to me to be a recipe for continued eruptions of conflict. In that RfC, [[User:Choor monster]] proposed removing the influence parameters altogether, with reference to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Infobox_person/Archive_19 this discussion], and received a couple of supports for this, just before the discussion went off the rails (in my opinion). Yet it surely makes sense to try to first come to an agreement about the simple question whether the parameters should be there at all, before arguing about the very thorny question of how many, and which, people/schools of thought should be listed as influenced by Freud (one of the most influential thinkers of our time), in case the parameters are kept. Could people please discuss the proposal to remove the influence parameters, and indicate whether they support or oppose it ?

'''Abk and SO'''

They are not heads of any recognized state. This is a fact, and we should not pretend that they are. Four countries recognizing a disputed territory doesn't make it a state. They are not UN members and not recognized by a majority of countries, whom still consider the territories a part of Georgia and illegally occupied by Russia. They also are not IOC members and had no Olympic team.  Russia occupying foreign territory and then recognizing it as a state should not merit calling the territory a state.  It would be no different than if the leader of Dontesk was invited to the Olympics.  Frankly, I don't think they should be mentioned at all as the leaders of illegitimate states; I think listing them as leaders of disputed states is a reasonable compromise.

In recognition that the location of the picture in ITN at the top of the section frequently places it next to an unrelated or even inappropriate blurb I recommend the following change to ITN's procedure.
* The first slot in the ITN section is to be reserved for blurbs with images. 
* A line is to be inserted between the pictured blurb and all other blurbs.
* All other blurbs are to remain in their reverse chronological order.
* The pictured item will remain at the top until another pictured item replaces it. 
* If the blurb is still current after removal from the pictured area, it would return to the list in its appropriate reverse chronological order location.
* If the blurb is considered stale at the time of its removal from the pictured area it would simply be removed from ITN entirely.

This proposal would remove potential reader confusion as to the correlation of image and blurb. While this removes the pictured item from the strict reverse chronological order, I am not convinced that the average reader (not editor) of ITN is even aware that the section is in such order. --[[User:Khajidha|Khajidha]] ([[User talk:Khajidha|talk]]) 13:26, 12 November 2014 (UTC)}}

The problem with RfA, as it is presently structured, is that it is based on what are essentially democratic principles. Being a Wikipedia administrator is a technocratic job. It is a job of maintenance. It is not a position of leadership, nor is it a legislative position. Democratic principles stymie and obfuscate the purpose of adminiship, and turn it into a populist post. Civil servants are properly appointed, not elected. That's the way it works in most governments, and that's how it should work here. We need to remove the democratic element, and stop this mob rule nonsense. Therefore, I'd propose the following. This is just a basic idea, sans details. A search committee is created with the sole purpose of appointing administrators. The committee is elected by the community, similarly to the present Arb Com elections. The committee would accept applications for adminship, and evaluate them based on merit. A simple majority of committee members in favour of a candidate would lead to that candidate being granted adminship. The committee would not just accept applications, but would also seek out potential candidates. This strikes me as the best way forward. Democracy is not the answer to every question.

As I noted in the Vindicated section of this page, there appear to be issues regarding the neutrality of this article and also treatment of the specific claims Webb made. In the introductory portion, several of his claims are listed and the article later claims he was vindicated without really being clear as to how he was vindicated. In the section above, I try to cite material both original and 3rd person that dispute this, but some editors took issue. I would like more commentators on this because at least one of the editors appears to be not impartial.

In [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_June_27#Category:Somalia_articles_by_quality|this CFD]], we renamed the WikiProject Somalia articles as: [[:Category:WikiProject Somalia articles by quality]], [[:Category:A-Class WikiProject Somalia articles]], [[:Category:B-Class WikiProject Somalia articles]], etc. (because WikiProject Somalia does not necessarily only pertain to the country of Somalia). In contrast, something like [[:Category:WikiProject Athletics articles]] goes by [[:Category:Athletics articles by quality]], [[:Category:A-Class Athletics articles]] is inaccurate and somewhat confusing because these are identified by the WikiProject not because they necessarily are articles on Athletics (which are under [[:Category:Athletics (sport)]]).

Although government of Turkey proclaims that it opposes ISIS on an official level, the academic world appears to dismiss such a notion altogether. In light of the [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-l-phillips/research-paper-isis-turke_b_6128950.html recent report] by the Huffington Post, it's becoming increasingly accepted by the academic community that Turkey may not only be actively neutral towards ISIS, but be supporting it outright. Turkey is currently listed as part of the opposition, albeit a "(limited/pending)" kind of opposition. I have currently found no evidence pointing to any incident wherein which Turkey has military engaged against ISIS. Turkey has gone so far as to disallow America's use of their own [[Incirlik Air Base|airbase in Incirlik]].

I propose to add a short subsection or atleast a bullet point forbidding editors to request help at country Wikiprojects (doesn't count for generic wikiprojects) for the purpose of content disputes (and more specifically inter-country / international disputes). This is synonymous to introducing deliberate systematic bias by inviting editors from a wikiproject with a very high probability of shared nationality and ofcourse as it is done at the posting editor's choice, it's almost always when they need an opinion where most from that nationality will share their POV. In my opinion ''and'' experience, this is never 'countered' by informing at the counter part wiki projects which are not as active or have a few editors or not as active [[WP:WikiProject Countering systemic bias]]. It only takes only a few editors from the informed Wikiproject to come and tilt the balance of discussion due to POV and bias even if a [[WP:AGF|majority of the editors]] know better so AGF for the majority Wikiproject members is moot. Same is the case with the less active counter part that may have editors who know better and do not get canvassed to the discussion and hence the few of the few is much less than few from the many (if that makes some sense). It shouldn't count as canvassing when an obscure article needs editing without a content dispute, it should be only considered ''during'' a content dispute or to game the system by doing the same later etc. I will also note that this act is not always intentional by the editors but has almost always the same result and informing them of [[WP:CANVASSING]] that specifically clarifies this will counter systematic bias. --<span style="text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml">[[User:TopGun|<b style="color:#060">lTopGunl</b>]] ([[User talk:TopGun|<b style="color:#000">talk</b>]])</span> 07:31, 27 November 2014 (UTC)}}

'''Note''' as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Imran_Khan#Summary_Of_Cricket_Career_by_Utilising_the_Infobox discussion], the matter of fact, issue is not a [[WP:NPOV]] and [[WP:BLP]] or removing the information as the editor [[User:Myopia123|Myopia123]] raising and discussing in a misleading way. The actually dispute is [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Infoboxes|Manual of Style/Infoboxes]], how many infoboxes should be in an article?, as I know there should be only one infobox of main information in the top right of an article, next to the lead section. I have taken a look at European sports articles that are included only one infobox, it is the wiki-standard and beauty of lay-out, adding more than one infoboxes is not appropriate, to hight-light the sport information, there should be a wiki-table in the body of section, as many European and American sport articles have. I have edited the article [[Imran Khan]] many times, there was added content that fall under [[WP:Promotional|promotional]] and [[WP:Puffery|puffery]]. The most of contributors are fans of the subject, they only add promotional and puffery content. It is an awkward style of contribution. The question is that if any subject has several professions, should be several infoboxes??!!. In the article there is an image in the subject's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan#Cricket_career cricket career], in which same information is included that has been added in its second infobox, it is redundant. I suggest that there should be only one infobox included main information, for the rest, there can be created wiki-table in the section body, that is appropriate style.[[User:Justice007|Justice007]] ([[User talk:Justice007|talk]]) 08:44, 7 November 2014 (UTC)}}

Editor @NeilN has indicated that death-toll statistics for the current civil war in the Ukraine should be excluded and deleted in the section for the civil war in the Ukraine article (section titled "Pro-Russian unrest"). The current death-toll statistics in the civil war in Ukraine now exceeds the casualty statistics for 9-11 in New York. Ukraine is currently going through its largest crisis since Chernobyl and @NeilN appears to believe that deleting information on casualty statistics in Ukraine ought to be done as WP:Notnews. @NeilN has deleted the following one sentence edit. "On 25 October 2014, the news weekly magazine ''Economist'' updated the status of Ukraine's casualty statistics in an article titled, The Battle for Ukraine's Future, stating: 'The energy and hope of a new beginning that sustained the (Maidan) revolution have been drained by a war that has claimed 3,600 lives.'" Those who think it is responsible to '''Support''' the inclusion of the casualty statistics in the article should indicate their position as a "Support" comment, and those who wish to block the inclusion of the death-toll statistics should indicate this as an '''Oppose''' comment.

Should the pictures on the right along with their captions be reinstated as part of the top right portion article?

The photographs were there when the article became a GA more than a year ago (see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Confiscated_Armenian_properties_in_Turkey&diff=572009779&oldid=572009103 here]). They were recently removed. To avoid any further edit-warring, I am opening up a RFC to bring about discussion. Feel free to suggest any kind of changes for the captions.

{{rfcquote|text=
Where do "Chronological summaries" fit in Wikipedia?  Are they encyclopedic? Should they be written?<br>
The articles in this category place information from existing articles on Olympic Games into chronological order by day.  Some of these were named as "YYYY Summer/Winter Olympics Highlights". Previous Articles for Deletion discussions ([[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/2006_Winter_Olympics_highlights|1]], [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Chronological_summary_of_the_2008_Summer_Olympics|2]]) raised issues multiple issues.  The information in the "highlights" already exists in articles for their respective Olympic Games and/or in sport specific pages (ex. [[2008_Summer_Olympics]], [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics]]).  The highlights articles may represent [[WP:REDUNDANTFORK|Redundant Forks]].  They may also represent a problem with [[WP:NPOV|Neutral Point of View]] as they inherently select a limited number of events or pieces of information and present them as more notable/important than others.  Along these lines, the articles may also be [[Wikipedia:No_original_research#Synthesis_of_published_material|original research]].  Some of these articles were updated during their respective Olympic Games, and were said to violate policy on [[Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#NEWS|What Wikipedia is not]].  The articles were also said to be contrary to the [[WP:MOS]].  They were also criticized as there was no long-term historical perspective to be gained from a per-day organization.<br>  Users in favor of keeping these articles argued that they were "useful", but required cleanup rather than deletion.  The move from "Highlights" to "Chronological Summary" may have addressed the NPOV issue.   [[User:Becky Sayles|Becky Sayles]] ([[User talk:Becky Sayles|talk]]) 22:05, 4 November 2014 (UTC)}}

One opinion is that since many [[WP:Reliable sources]], as seen [https://www.google.com/search?q=The+vagina+has+three+layers&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1&gws_rd=ssl#q=The+vagina+has+three+layers&tbm=bks&gws_rd=ssl here] and [https://www.google.com/search?q=The+vagina+has+four+layers&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1&gws_rd=ssl here], describe the vaginal walls as being composed of three layers or four layers, we should mention both because presenting both satisfies [[WP:Verifiability]] (what it states about sources disagreeing with each other) and [[WP:Due weight]], and takes care of any confusion presented to readers by discrepancies in the anatomical literature. This is regardless of how much detail we give both aspects. Another opinion is that the "[t]hree/four layers seems to be just an imaginary manifestation of different ways of describing the same thing that might be found in different books or perhaps simplification in some books" and that "we should see past this and just describe the structure as it is," which "would enormously simplify the description on layers and avoid duplication." And, also, that the text should be "written with the main aim of helping readers to understand the structures rather than giving an account of different ways to describe the layers of the vagina given by different anatomy texts." A counterargument to this is that naming how many layers there are, or are usually documented, is writing the article "with the main aim of helping readers to understand the structures." The number of vaginal layers are included in anatomy books and other anatomical texts precisely to help people understand the vagina's anatomy; for example, which layer is the stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium.

For how the section in the article currently looks, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vagina&diff=632456918&oldid=632366259#Layers.2C_regions_and_histology here.] And for the full discussion on this matter, see [[Talk:Vagina#Three/four layers|the section immediately above this one]] on the Vagina article talk page (I provided the link for those who are viewing this from the WP:RfC page).

There has not been consensus on usage of the terms Vapor, Mist, and Aerosol as to the best word to use for what comes out of an e-cigarette. This disagreement has the words being changed all the time. The common term used by most average people and the media to describe the inhalable product of E-cigarettes is Vapor. A number of Medical journals describe it as Aerosol, but there are also a lot of uses of Vapor in journal articles. No one to my knowledge except for this article describes it as Mist. There is a discussion now on the page discussing this issue.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Electronic_cigarette#Wholesale_changing_of_.22vapor.22_to_.22mist.22] There is also one in the archives[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Electronic_cigarette/Archive_11#Confusing] that ended in a limited agreement for the start of the lede only.  Some editors of this page have suggested that in the interest of being accurate we should use Aerosol over the common term Vapor.
:Questions:
*A. Should we use Mist?
*B. Should we use the word the medical source uses when writing sentences based on that source in the article? 
*C. Should we use the term that any sources use when writing sentences based on that source in the article?
*D. Should we use Vapor, Mist, or Aerosol exclusively? (please mention your choice first when answering)
*E. Should we allow wikilinking of one of these terms to a different page when one already exists on the word used? [[User:AlbinoFerret|<span style="color:white; background-color:black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 93%;">AlbinoFerret</span>]] 23:16, 15 November 2014 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
It has become unclear what the [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC|primary meaning]] of the term ''[[light bulb]]'' is now. Traditionally, ''light bulb'' has unambiguously referred to an [[incandescent light bulb]], and the term currently redirects there. Incandescent light bulbs are being rapidly replaced by other technologies, however, and are no longer available in some places. In common usage, "light bulb" is at least sometimes being applied to other technologies such as [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s and [[LED lamp]]s. Is it still true that "incandescent light bulb" is the [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC|primary topic]] in this case? 

A quick [http://www.onelook.com/?w=light+bulb&ls=a survey of online dictionaries] finds that most still define a light bulb as an incandescent lamp, but that a few including American Heritage, MacMillan, and Random House have broader definitions.--[[User:Srleffler|Srleffler]] ([[User talk:Srleffler|talk]]) 18:50, 9 November 2014 (UTC)}}

#The reference advisory limits for mercury toxicity in Canada. These are advisory limits which are used to regulate the safety of dental amalgam.
#Data from the most recent Canadian Health Survey. (This is a massive health survey the goverment of Canada does periodically.) In the last survey, one of the things they collected data on was the number of amalgam fillings each person had. They also collected body samples and measured mercury concentration in urine. They found that 80% of people had a daily dose of Hg that exceeding the recommended dose limit. 
#Statements of the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology. That is an association of dental professionals focused on the exact topic of this article. Removed my summary of their work, positions, and main findings.

Other things (not my work) s/he has removed all information about:
-- amalgam containing possible endocrine disrupters, 
-- factors in absorption of mercury from amalgam (bruxism, gum chewing)
-- research on monkeys showing accumulation in organs

I don't mind when others find a more succint or pertinent way of stating the information. But this behavior of wholesale removing relevant information is disrespectful of the time, work, and perspective of other users. As a contributor to Wikipedia, I am very tired of this kind of behaviour. I have no agenda in this article. I came to it while looking for information about mercury toxicity. I tried to contribute what I found to be relevant & credible information.

The most commonly used genre was R&B followed by soul and they should be there instead of a source that just says his music after Journey through the Secret Life of Plants, Wonder's music has tightened and toughened into a roiling pop-funk that hits several fiery grooves but that doesn't mean the album is 100% explicitly a pop-funk album and therefore it should be removed.

I recently [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Civility&diff=636486971&oldid=634445315 added a quote regarding expletives] from ArbCom's recent decision. That addition has been [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Civility&curid=456268&diff=636509397&oldid=636486971 reverted] as "point of view&nbsp;... [and] out of context." Though I'm not sure how quoting an entire subsection of their findings is out-of-context. Also, I'm not sure what "you appear to be an interested party" has to do with anything. Does anyone else think that this should be included here:

{{Quote|Regarding expletives, in December 2014 the Arbitration Committee [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Interactions at GGTF#Expletives|unanimously agreed]] to the following language: "Although there are cultural differences in the use of certain expletives, there is rarely any need to use such language on Wikipedia and so they should be avoided. Editors who know, or are told, that a specific word usage is reasonably understood as offensive by other Wikipedians should refrain from using that word or usage, unless there is a specific and legitimate reason for doing so in a particular instance."}}

I know that Arbcom does not necessarily write policy, but they certainly rule on matters regarding policy. I think this at least states their position, and I think that position is relevant to this policy.

There has been discussion before on this sort of thing, but mostly focused on whether pronunciation information should be in the lead ''or'' in the infobox. Without any bearing on the MOS question of whether the pronunciation belongs in the lead, I propose that we add a "pronounced" argument to this infobox, which can be used either in lieu of pronunciations in the lead, or in addition to a pronunciation in the lead, depending on the preferred style convention (either globally or article-by-article). I suggest that it be included under "native name", and preferably there would be slots for multiple pronunciation arguments, separated by language and/or country as appropriate.

The description:
:'''The feature that sets a metacompiler apart from a standard compiler-compiler is that a metacompiler is written in its own language and translates itself'''.
Revised 11/17/2014

There is some confusion about this RFC. It is basicly about the claim; that that a metacompiler is written in its own language and translates itself.

There are many metacompilers that are not written in their own language nor do they translates their self.
::META I, Val Schorre, hand coded was used to compiler META II.
::Meta III,Schneider and Johnson, was implemented completely in assembly language.
::Bookl, Erwin Book, written in LISP 
::Book2, Erwin Book, written in LISP
::SIMPLE written in PL/I
::CGS, Warshall and Shapiro, written in CL-1.

The following statement has confused the issue here.--[[User:Steamerandy|Steamerandy]] ([[User talk:Steamerandy|talk]]) 13:33, 18 November 2014 (UTC)}}

==Introduction'''

It  has been suggested in  various discussions that  an Admin Review Board may  be a solution to  the handling  of complaints about  sysop  actions and/or behaviour unbecoming  of admins. 

It  has been suggested that  the lack  of an effective and/or dedicated procedure for addressing  admin  behaviour is one of the reasons for the assumed failure of [[WP:RfA]] to  produce sufficient candidates of the right  calibre. 

It  has been suggested that  some tasks of the Arbitration  Committee could be devolved to a more community-based system. This is one of them.

It  has further been suggested on  some talk  pages that  this task could be delegated to the [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|Bureaucrats]].

;Currently:
#Bureaucrats are empowered to  judge consensus and physically create the sysop  flag following  a candidate's successful  pass at [[WP:RfA]].
#Bureaucrats can remove the sysop flag under certain  circumstances, one of these being  under instruction  from [[WP:Arbcom|Arbcom]] following  an Arbcom  decision to desysop.
#Although they possess the tool, Bureaucrats are not currently permitted to remove the sysop flag for disciplinary reasons without an Arbcom  mandate.

'''Proposal'''

{{Shortcut|WP:BARC}}
This ''Request for Comment'' is to  '''test the community's opinion''' on:

'''Whether admin related disciplinary issues can be devolved from  the Arbitration  Committee to the Bureaucrats who  among their other tasks could be considered as a ''Bureaucrats' Admin Review Committee (BARC)'' to  arrive at  a consensus for any  sanctions to applied on  Administrators (Sysops), including  blocks, bans, or removal  of admin  rights, following appropriate requests from  the community'''

'''Background'''

*Bureaucrats are a higher 'authority'  than administrators.
*Bureaucrats have gained the community's trust  and confidence  through their election  at  [[WP:RfB]] which  requires a higher pass mark than [[WP:RfA]].
*Bureacrats have relatively few powers in  addition to  their admin tools .
*There are 34 Bureaucrats ([[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats#Current bureaucrats|as of this proposal]]).
;See also: 
*[[Wikipedia:Removing administrator rights]]
*[[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee/Procedures#Removal of permissions]]
*[[Wikipedia:Blocking policy]]
*[[Wikipedia:Banning policy]]
;Notes:
#'''This Request for Comment is  NOT for discussing the mechanics of how this would take place, or for drafting  its policy.'''
#'''This Request for Comment is NOT for introducing  other alternative methods of admin  review.'''
#Participants are requested to  observe the above, and not turn this RfC into  a general  discussion about  admin  sanctions. 
# There is only  one section for comments, a threaded discussion. Please avoid breaking out into  ''Support''  and ''Oppose'' comments, instead, because this is designed purely  to  '''''test'''''  the community's opinion, please maintain  the spirit  of discussion.
#'''Please do  not'''  create tangential  discussions. If  you  have a different proposal  for Community Desysoping, start your own RfC.

If broad consensus is achieved in support of the proposal, '''other discussions will  take place''' to  decide how the ''Bureaucrats' Admin Review Committee'' should be constituted,  how and where their discussion  should take place, and how their decisions would be empowered and enacted, '''Note again: such discussions are NOT  for this present  RfC.'''

:This RfC will  be open  for 30 days, or closed earlier if an overwhelming consensus either way is obvious.
:<small>This RfC has been noted on  the Village Pump, Central RfC, RfC notifications, and personally in  a neutral and identical manner to  all  users who  participated on  or edited   similar related discussions. 04:22, 19 November 2014 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
A federal judge in Kansas issued a [[preliminary injunction]] barring the defendants: court clerks in Douglas and Sedgwick counties, along with the secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment from enforcing Kansas's same-sex marriage ban. The Attorney General insists that the ruling only applies to the defendants. As a result, the state of Kansas is refusing to recognize same-sex marriages and only 19 of 105 counties are issuing licenses to same-sex couples. These 19 counties account for 60% of the population and any same-sex couple that receives a marriage license from one of these counties can get married anywhere in the state of Kansas. In addition, Johnson County began issuing licenses to same-sex couples ''before'' the federal court ruling in response to a [[precedent]] set by the Tenth Circuit of Appeals. The state supreme court blocked the county from issuing licenses to same-sex couples. In response to the federal court ruling, the hold was eventually lifted. However, the state supreme court decided not to rule on whether or not same-sex marriage is legal. The current consensus for Kansas is deadlocked. Here is what has been suggested for how to color Kansas: solid dark blue, striped dark blue-medium blue, striped dark blue-light blue, striped dark blue-gray, and striped dark blue-medium red. 

To the right is the map & key for ''all'' the colors:

Wikipedia has [[Lists of countries and territories]] and a [[List of sovereign states]] with many subsidiary lists including [[List of sovereign states in the 2010s]]. Someone inserted "Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant" [[List of sovereign states in the 2010s#I|right between Ireland and Israel]] on that one list, and no other I could find so far.  Since ISIL is accurately listed at [[List of active rebel groups]] can we have consensus that '''the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is not a [[sovereign state]], [[country]], or [[sub-national entity]] and should not be listed as such'''. This means we will not list ISIL on any of the referenced lists of States and Countries and that we will not refer to ISIL as having characteristics exclusive to real states or subnational entities (a capital, a government, currency, defined borders etc) I believe this is the current state of consensus across Wikipedia but outside this [[ISIL]] article can not find any discussion on this matter. If you agree write '''Support'''. If you disagree, write '''Oppose''' and provide RS evidence against the above statement. I believe if we start recognizing ISIL as a state we have to alter the recognition and borders of [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]]  Thank-you for participating.

There are two conflicting perspectives on how the episode segments in this season should be organized.  The series is generally considered a 22-minute program (30 mins w/ commercials), which in the past has usually paired two 11-minute carts (episode segments) into one half-hour episode.  This season, Disney has aired a number of 11-minute carts by themselves.  

The disupute: 
* One side believes that episodes should be paired, even if the first cart aired days before what is presumed to be the second cart.
* The other side believes the episodes should not be paired, but listed individually since they air on separate days.
* Sources typically considered reliable, like [http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/phineas-and-ferb/episodes-season-5/289680 TVGuide.com], [http://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/series/phineas-and-ferb/seasons-episodes/AA4csBG MSN TV], [http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/phineas-and-ferb/listings/ The Futon Critic], treat this information differently, which is causing confusion.  TVGuide.com doesn't pair the episodes, they list the airdates.  Futon Critic does pair the episodes, and assigns A and B carts to episode numbers, for example #413A "Thanks But No Thanks", and iTunes [https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/phineas-and-ferb-vol.-10/id712572916 does as well].  Compounding the problem, is the fact that Zap2It hasn't listed any episodes from this season, and TVGuide and MSN are considering some episodes as Season 5, not Season 4.

Community input is requested to figure out if there is an intuitive and reasonable way to include this content when the various sources are at odds. 01:09, 23 November 2014‎ (UTC)

Remove the misreported birth name "Michael Joseph Hall" completely from the article as it conflicts with all RS after October 22 and 23. 

Original Source for "Michael Joseph Hall" [http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/22/us-canada-attacks-suspect-idUSKCN0IB2IX20141022 reuters] article published Oct 22 (the day of the shooting) "Some U.S. government sources said the shooter was born Michael Joseph Hall but changed his name to Zehaf-Bibeau." There are other reports using the Hall name, quoting reuters or US officials, but all I could find were published on Oct 22 or 23 within 48 hours of the shootings. 

The next day the original source [http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/23/us-canada-attacks-profile-idUSKCN0IC2GW20141023 reuters] reported "Court records in Montreal showed Zehaf-Bibeau was born to Susan Bibeau in 1982 after she had a brief relationship with Bulgasem Zehaf. The two had a rocky relationship but were married in 1989, Bulgasem said in an affidavit. After (his) birth, his mother, Susan Bibeau and I renewed our relationship and I also established links with my son," Zehaf said in the affidavit. "I was entitled to ... look after his education, his security, and to give him all my love." The parents petitioned in 1995 to change their son's name from '''Joseph Paul Michael Bibeau''' to '''Joseph Paul Michael Abdallah Bulgasem Zehaf Bibeau'''. Zehaf was also registered as the child's father at the time."

The following additional indepth articles published after the intial flury of inacurate info passed support this proposal: [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/23/michael-zehaf-bibeau-past_n_6037976.html Huff Post] [http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/michael-zehaf-bibeau-addict-drifter-walking-contradiction/ Macleans who says explicetly they obtained the court records] [http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/michael-zehaf-bibeau-a-timeline Ottawa Citizen] [http://www.thestarphoenix.com/health/Michael+Zehaf+Bibeau+journey+death+Parliament+Hill/10365292/story.html the Star Phynox] and there are [https://www.google.com/search?q=Joseph+Paul+Michael+Bibeau&oq=Joseph+Paul+Michael+Bibeau&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8&qscrl=1#safe=off&qscrl=1&q=%22Joseph+Paul+Michael+Bibeau%22 many more].

I am seeking comments and consensus because my efforts to correct this inaccuracy - that was inserted in good faith the day of the shooting - were twice reverted . See previous section for the details.

I took much time to go through these records but none of the reasons could convince me why M.K. Gandhi is still called Mahatma in an encyclopedia.

As a rule of thumb, most of those above 80% approval pass; most of those below 70% fail; the judgment of passing is subject to bureaucratic discretion (and in some cases further discussion)''". I propose simply lowering the guidelines by 5%. This would not alter the fact that RfA's are closed primarily based upon the strength of rationales presented. This change would reflect the fact that we have plentiful votes to block inappropriate candidates, and it would encourage a slight easing of when a close should consider applying default-pass or default-fail.

This RfC concerns the following:

{{talkquote|[[Ronald S. Sullivan Jr.]], director of [[Harvard Law School]]'s Criminal Justice Institute, said that McCulloch avoided responsibility for the result, calling the case an unusual use of a grand jury's resources.}}

Reference: [http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ferguson-da-analysis-20141126-story.html Prosecutor's grand jury strategy in Ferguson case adds to controversy]

'''Should this be added back into the article or should this stay out per [[WP:BLPREMOVE]]?'''

Note: This is derived from following material.
{{talkquote|"This was a strategic and problematic use of a grand jury to get the result he wanted," said Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., director of the Harvard Criminal Justice Institute at Harvard University. "As a strategic move, it was smart; he got what he wanted without being seen as directly responsible for the result."

Sullivan called the case "the most unusual marshaling of a grand jury's resources I've seen in my 25 years as a lawyer and scholar."}}

'''Survey (Sullivan)'''

*'''Replace''' because Sullivan raised unsupported claims of bias and deception by McCulloch.

There was [[#Requested move|no consensus last year to rename this article]] despite support votes. [[WP:BIO1E]] of [[WP:NCP]] guideline was used in previous discussion but was rebutted.

Later, the press speculated an affair, so then-Representative [[Gary Condit]] got harassed by the press until he confessed the affair with the missing intern. I am unsure whether events or she is more notable than the other. The guideline says:<blockquote>It is important to remember that "notable" is not a synonym for "famous". Someone may have become famous due to one event, but may nevertheless be notable for more than one event. Similarly, a person may be generally famous, but only notable for only a single event.</blockquote> She may have failed [[WP:ANYBIO]] because she hasn't won an award or done a recognized contribution to society, but whether she passes [[WP:BASIC]] and [[WP:notability]] is our concern.

The account creator usergroup was given title blacklist override (tboverride) in order to create accounts matching the title blacklist, but the userright allows to override the title blacklist everywhere, so also for moves, pages creations and editing of title blacklist protected pages (used for editnotices, TFAs, etc). A userright allowing override only for account creations (tboverride-account) was created a few years ago, but we didn't switch back then because there was some purpose in allowing selected non-admins to edit those. Now, we have the template editor usergroup, specifically designed for this purpose, so there is no longer any need for it. And account creator is granted increasingly easily to any user who claims to need it for an event or meetup, without regard to experience; this wouldn't be a problem in itself, but this creates a pointless security risk. So we should grant them tboverride-account instead of tboverride. The same goes for the userright bypassing rate limits (noratelimit), which allows to create more than six accounts per 24 hours but also makes page moves unlimited, etc. We could request switching to a userright allowing bypass only for account creations.

I believe that the lede of this article as it stands right now is excruciatingly painful to read, it is filled with different review articles more or less contradicting each other and I don't think that citing specific medical reviews in the lead is helpful or interesting to the reader. I believe that we can summarize it in a more efficient way by redirecting the readers to specific articles that talks extensively about subjects like [[Safety of electronic cigarettes]] or [[Legal status of electronic cigarettes]], which is what [[User:TheNorlo/stuff|I am trying to accomplish here]] with the participation of interested editors. My goal is not necessarily to shorten the lede but to simplify it, the final version will probably be longer than this draft. I am sensing a lot of resistance to change from some editors and so I ask the question: 

* Should the lede stay the way it is right now or should we work together in making it more readable and accessible to the readers that are unfamiliar with the topic by summerazing it in the way that I've explained above? Of course, it's not my way or the highway here, if you have a better way of enhancing the readability of the lead, please share.

{{rfcquote|text=
#'''Currently:''' The guidance notes for the "[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Classical music/Guidelines#Uses in popular culture|Use in popular culture]]" section of the Classical Music Guideline has been discussed by over the past 10 weeks without reaching a consensus. The old guideline makes presumptions about what readers are interested in, and instructs that edits such as "Work X was used in [movie/TV show/electronic game] Y" should be politely reverted.
#'''Current practice:''' Most well known uses of music in popular culture (i.e. classical music used in films, TV and other media) does appear in the music articles. However there are also examples where this information is missing.  It is impossible to know how much encyclopedic information is lost or never added as authors are discouraged to add content.
#'''Conflict:''' Some editors want to limit and restrict such content as in their view it provides no information about the music. The alternate view is that although miscellaneous points may be regarded as "trivia", provided they are not "trivial" and comply with Wikipedia policies, should be included as factual encyclopedic information within the music article in question.
#'''Balance:''' A balance is necessary between [[WP:INDISCRIMINATE|indiscriminate content]] (i.e. trivial or irrelevant information) and the [[WP:TRIVIA|style of reporting trivia]] (i.e. miscellaneous facts). There is probably good agreement about applying the [[WP:TRIVIA]] guidance.
#'''History:''' It appears that this conflict of views has been a problem over many years. The talk page of [[talk:Für_Elise#Fur Elise in Popular Culture|Beethoven's Fur Elise]] reveals that in 2007 "There's an intensive campaign going on now to kill off all the "in popular culture" articles" which explains why the existing guidance notes (written in 2009) suggest any such edits be politely reverted.
#'''Essay:''' The [[WP:IPC]] essay has gone through a number of revisions over the years, and currently appears to represent a well thought out view, which is generally accepted by all.
#'''Talk:''' The lengthy discussion has taken place on the [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Classical music]] page (as this page gets more followers), and several proposed changes proposed, but without much agreement between members.
Please note: I raised the RFC and notified you I would be away on holiday. I am now back. I am asking for help and mediation is finding consensus on this difficult topic.  If there is one key question to ask, then it is: "Is it acceptable for a guideline to be worded in such a manner that relevant information about the use of a piece of classical music in popular culture (e.g. a film) should be discouraged and edits reverted?"  [[WP:WikiProject_Classical_music/Guidelines#Uses_in_popular_culture|This Classical music guideline]] appears to conflict with various policies and guidelines, but there is great resistance by some to replace it with a guideline that allows such information, as it is considered irrelevant to the article.

[[User:Jytdog]] has proposed changing:
*"[[Scientific consensus]], can be found in recent, authoritative [[review article]]s or in textbooks or in some forms of [[monograph]]s."

to

*"Statements and [[Medical guideline|practice guidelines]] issued by major professional medical or scientific societies (For example, the [[European Society of Cardiology]], or the [[Infectious Disease Society of America]]) and governmental and quasi-governmental health authorities (for example, [[AHRQ]], [[USPSTF]], [[NICE]], and [[WHO]]) are ideal sources for information regarding current medical and scientific consensus. Other sources include textbooks, some forms of [[monographs]], [[review articles]], and [[systematic reviews]] that include [[meta-analysis]]. Significant minority opinions taken from reliable secondary sources should also be presented with appropriate [[WP:WEIGHT|weighting]]. Care should be taken not to ignore evidence-based challenges to consensus views originating from internationally recognized medical organizations such as the [[Cochrane Collaboration]]." 

'''Oppose'''

* '''Oppose''' While I do not believe the original wording is perfect I do not believe the new wording is an improvement. Many organizations produce excellent meta-analysis including: major medical organizations, scientific societies, AHRQ, USPTF and the Cochrane collaboration. It is unclear why we are separating out Cochrane reviews from other high quality reviews? Also the balance between practice guidelines and systematic reviews depends on the topic and specific issue in question. Some practice guidelines are good and others are less good and the same applies to reviews. Factors such as the target patient population they are geared towards and the up to dateness must also be taken into account. Cochrane and WHO publish material that is often more global in scope while most guidelines out of the USA and UK are very USA and UK centric. A blanket statement for one over the other is not a good idea as these issues should be addressed on a case by case bases. Currently we balance the positions from major reviews with those of the position statements of national and internationally recognized organizations and we should continue to do so.

This woman's name was [[:sv:Helvig av Holstein|Helvig]], Helwig or [http://www.whatisthemeaningofname.com/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-name-heilwig-7914/ Heilwig], not [[Hedwig (name)|Hedvig/Hedwig]].

As can be seen above, consensus decided in 2009 to name the article incorrectly.

===WP:BDPLACE Drafts'''

[[WP:BDPLACE]] Draft version 2 is now being [[Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_(geographic_names)#Discussion_on_Draft_v2|discussed]].

'''Draft v1'''

A proposal for [[WP:NCGN]]#Bangladesh follows.
<blockquote>
<hr/>
Geographic locations (hereafter ''place'') can be grouped in following levels:
* '''Level 0''': Country, i.e. Bangladesh
* '''Level 1''': City, town, [[Districts of Bangladesh|district]], [[Divisions of Bangladesh|division]] 
* '''Level 2''': Upazilla, village, area, neighborhood etc

Whenever possible, articles on places in Bangladesh go under '''<nowiki>[[placename]]</nowiki>'''. [UPDATE] When different names and spelling are in use, the one used by administration and found in Bangladesh government portal will be used.

For places requiring disambiguation:
* Usual convention for Level 1 places is '''<nowiki>[[placename, Bangladesh]]</nowiki>'''.
* For a place in Level 2, its upper level location's name is used, i.e. '''<nowiki>[[placename, parent place]]</nowiki>'''. 
* [UPDATE] If a parent place name is also ambiguous, the disambiguated article name will be used.
* [UPDATE] For disambiguation parent place, words like ''district'', ''division'', ''upazilla'' will be dropped whenever possible for the sake of brevity.
* [UPDATE] Generally towns and cities will be in <nowiki>[[cityname]] or [[townname]]</nowiki> while districts, divisions, upazillas etc administrative regions will almost always include these words in main article name, such as <nowiki>[[X District]], [[X Division]], [[X Sadar Upazilla]]</nowiki>.

A little elaboration:
* For a city, '''<nowiki>[[cityname, Bangladesh]]</nowiki>''' is used.
* For a neighborhood within a city, '''<nowiki>[[placename, cityname]]</nowiki>''' is used.
* For a upazilla withing district, '''<nowiki>[[upazilla name, district name]]</nowiki>''' is used.
* Only when one level of disambiguation do not suffice, another level of disambiguation can be used. For example, <s>is</s> if place A is in city B, and there is another place named A in B in some other country, then <nowiki>[[A, B, Bangladesh]]</nowiki> can be used.
* <s>In</s> Cases that are not covered here, minimal disambiguation levels with sensible names <s>will be used</s> is suggested. 
<hr/>
</blockquote>

'''Draft v2'''

<blockquote><hr/>

'''Bangladesh'''

{{shortcut|WP:BDPLACE}}
Geographic places of Bangladesh include [1] localities (cities, towns, villages, neighborhoods etc) and [2] geo-political territories. Place names shall be widely accepted English names. Hence, [[[[Sylhet]]]] but not <nowiki>[[Silet]]</nowiki>.  Alternative and local names can be mentioned in the [[WP:LEDE|lede]]. 

When multiple spellings exist, refer to [http://bangladesh.gov.bd Bangladesh government portal] or [[Banglapedia]]. Alternative spellings can be redirected. 

'''''Localities and territories''''': 
*Usually proper names of administrative territories, such as [[Divisions of Bangladesh|divisions]], [[Districts of Bangladesh|districts]], [[upazila]]s, [[Wards of Bangladesh|wards]], unions include these words as part of their names. In contrast, names of localities do not. Hence, [[[[Dhaka]]]] but not [[[[Dhaka city]]]] while [[[[Dhaka Division]]]] and [[[[Dhaka District]]]]. Similarly, [[[[Dhanmondi]]]] and <nowiki>[[Jigatola]]</nowiki> are two neighborhoods within [[[[Dhanmondi Thana]]]]. 

* Words: ''district'', ''division'', ''upazila'', ''thana'' are generally part of proper name and thus capitalized. Hence, [[Dhanmondi Thana]] but not <nowiki>[[Dhanmondi thana]]</nowiki>.

* Islands, special places of interest and regions can be handled similarly as localities.

* Often a locality can be governed by several different types of local governments. In such cases administrative bodies and branches may have their distinct articles. For example, municipal duties of [[Dhaka]] is primarily attributed to [[Dhaka North City Corporation]] and [[Dhaka South City Corporation]]. Civil policing is done by [[Dhaka Metropolitan Police]] (DMP) through several thanas including [[[[Badda Thana]]]], [[[[Gulshan Thana]]]] etc. Special administrative divisions will have the type name in parentheses; e.g. <nowiki>[[Gulshan (DNCC Zone)]]</nowiki>.

'''''Disambiguation''''': 

Whenever possible, articles on places in Bangladesh go under  <nowiki>[[placename]] </nowiki>. Note that, [[Dhaka]], [[Dhaka District]] and [[Dhaka Division]] are different place names. 

When disambiguation is needed, comma convention will be used:

* For cities, district head quarter towns:  <nowiki>[[placename, Bangladesh]]</nowiki>
* For divisions and districts: <nowiki>[[placename, Bangladesh]]</nowiki>
* For places within cities and towns: <nowiki>[[placename, cityname]]</nowiki>
* For places and territories within districts, but not in a city: <nowiki>[[placename, district]]</nowiki>. Here, district name would drop the part ''District'' from name for sake of brevity. e.g. [[[[Kaliganj Upazila, Gazipur]]]] but not <nowiki>[[Kaliganj Upazila, Gazipur District]]</nowiki>.
* When one level of disambiguation is not sufficient, use disambiguated name of parent place: <nowiki>[[placename, A, B]]</nowiki>.

There has been some debate and article instability over the inclusion, or not, of several details, primarily for BLP reasons. I'd like to try to get some consensus on at least some of these, so I propose a [[WP:POLL|poll]] to gauge the current opinion on each of these matters.

Can editors please indicate their opinion - with a ''brief'' reason - on each of the items below. It's possible (based on previous comments) that at least some answers will be conditional on others, eg "include in 'murder' categories if and only if suspect's name is not mentioned". If that's the case, please say so (again, briefly). [[User:Mitch Ames|Mitch Ames]] ([[User talk:Mitch Ames|talk]]) 02:29, 26 December 2014 (UTC)}}
