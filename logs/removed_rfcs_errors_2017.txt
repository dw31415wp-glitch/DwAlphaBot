"The commission, under [[William Peel, 1st Earl Peel|Lord Peel]], was appointed on 7 August 1936 to investigate the cause for the outbreak of the Arab rebellion and the way the Articles of the Mandate were being implemented. Between November 1936 and January 1937 the commission studied the situation in the country, and in June 1937 published its recommendation to abolish the Mandate and to divide the country between Arabs and Jews." [Source: \'\'The Survey of Palestine under the British Mandate: 1920 - 1948\'\', published by the British Mandate government printing office in Jerusalem in 1946, p. 166] The UN adopted the same position in 1947, with, however, the Arabs rejecting the 1947 proposed UN Partition Plan.[Source...] War soon broke-out, with Egypt sending troops into the country to help secure the country for an Arab state, without any recognition of Israeli sovereignty. At the conclusion of armed conflict, the interim borders were defined (delineated) by the outcome of war, with the Jordanian army taking-up positions within the territories seen by them as the future Arab state, although in scope considerably less than what was originally intended by Great Britain and the UN, since [[Ben-Gurion]] agreed that the paramilitary forces now made into the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] be permitted to take-over the Negev, then occupied by Egyptian troops. In retrospect, lands taken by Jordan in 1948 were officially recognized as the "West Bank" of Jordan in the [[Armistice Agreements 1949|1949 Armistice agreement]], with lands conquered by Israel forming their \'\'de-facto\'\' territorial boundary.
