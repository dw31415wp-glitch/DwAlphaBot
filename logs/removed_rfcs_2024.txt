The link to the YouTube video was originally added in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vanessa_Marquez&diff=prev&oldid=944340424 March 2020]; the video itself was later uploaded and added to the article in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vanessa_Marquez&diff=prev&oldid=1155862082 May of this year]. It is narrated, with a viewer discretion warning at the start, and the shots of her incapacitated body and the officer who fired the weapon are both blurred, so it's not as if no effort was made to depict what transpired in a respectful light; nevertheless, it still feels like something that should be approved by community consensus first.

Should we state in the lead that the Colorado Court ruled that Trump is disqualified from the presidency under the 14th amendment for engaging in insurrection, and ordered that he be removed from the Colorado ballot as a result?

Reliable sources like CBS news describe the Colorado ruling as follows: "In a stunning decision that could have major ramifications for the 2024 presidential election, the Colorado Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that former President Donald Trump is disqualified from holding office again and ordered the secretary of state to remove his name from the state's primary ballot." https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colorado-supreme-court-opinions-decision-trump-primary-ballot/. The Court itself describes its holding in very similar terms: "A majority of the court holds that President Trump is ineligible from holding the office of President under section three of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution...The sum of these parts is this: President Trump is disqualified from holding the office of President under Section Three; because he is disqualified, it would be a wrongful act under the Election Code for the Secretary to list him as a candidate on the presidential primary ballot." Should we add this material to the lead and adopt similar language, stating something like: 
<blockquote>The Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump is disqualified from the Presidency under section three of the 14th amendment for engaging in insurrection against the United States, and ordered that he be removed from the Colorado presidential ballot as a result.

Reliable sources agree that Trump said that he'd be a dictator on "day one," and use this exact phraseology: the Atlantic "Donald Trump, the former president of the United States who tried to steal the 2020 election, says he’ll be a dictator on day one of a second term. That’s not the rhetorical excess of the mainstream press, nor is it the cynical spin of a political rival. It’s just what Trump said." "Trump says he'll be a dictator on 'day one'", CBS "Trump says he would be a dictator only on Day One if he wins", NY Times "Trump says he wouldn't be a dictator, except on day one", USA Today "Trump says he will be a dictator only on day one."

Do you find this phrase acceptable?

I discussed with @[[User:Adakiko|Adakiko]] about adding a point of view denying this incident.
Discussion above here [[Talk:Banu_Fazara#Religious_sources]]. 

Please read the discussion between us so that you have an idea about the topic.

I believe that the article cannot be left as it is so that the reader thinks that the incident is a historical fact. Especially since it is considered unreliable according to the rules of Islamic [[hadith studies]]. But the criticisms written by Muslims about it are mostly found in forums, blogs, or Facebook. Which cannot be considered as sources on the wiki. 
And according to wiki policy, original research cannot be published. 

But I found [[Islamqa.info]] (a website that specializes in Islamic religious sciences and answers questions that come to it from Muslims and others) publishing a criticism in which it denies that incident and clarifies that it is not proven according to the rules of Islamic hadith science. But there is no consensus among wiki editors that the site is considered a reliable source. I suggest that the phrase ((the Islamqa.info website, which is supervised by Sheikh Muhammad Saleh Al-Munajjid, denies the incident)) be written as a consensus phrase. 

[[User:Adakiko|Adakiko]] suggested that I start [[wp:RfC]].

The subject Sreeleela happens to an American born person who was brought up in India from her childhood. She is known for her appearance in Telugu films. She is known as a Telugu film actress and not an American actress. Multiple editors appear to be disputing on whether the subject should be referred to as a Telugu-film actress, as she is known for the same or she should be referred to as an American actress just because her citizenship happens to of USA. I think it makes more sense to refer to the subject as an Indian-film actress. 

For example, if a Brazilian who was born in Brazil came to USA when they were 1 year old or so and later when they are 22 years old, they started acting in Hollywood films and are known for the same, I'd refer to them as a Hollywood actor or American film actor and not Brazilian actor right. Please correct if this is wrong. 

Should the subject be referred to as an Indian-film actress or as an American actress.

There are three questions:
#How do neutral editors here define a "song?"  Editor performing revisions insists an instrumental work is not a song, contrary to generally accepted vernacular on Wikipedia.
#If instrumentals are indeed deemed to be a "song" then are instrumental solo performances in a concert recording therefore also defined as songs, in particular when those recordings are named and tracked as such by the official song publisher on official releases?
#Conversely, if instrumentals are ultimately deemed not to be a "song" then is a wiser compromise to retitle the page so it maintains its original intent as a comprehensive list of a band's compositions, versus removing everything that doesn't fit the much narrower definition of a "song?"

* '''June 29, 2019''': [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Detailed_logarithmic_timeline&diff=prev&oldid=904071466 Eric Kvaalen restored the sentence] "because [fossil fuels] will run out if we don't lower our consumption".
* '''June 30, 2019''': [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Detailed_logarithmic_timeline&diff=prev&oldid=904257091 I removed it again] with the edit summary ''"Because they'll run out" just applies to oil (2060, unless we go through our coal and gas reserves far quicklier) and assumes we won't find new reserves (on Earth or in space) to extract from or find ways to artificially synthesize them on a large scale within the next 100 years. (but we shouldn't assume we will either)''
* '''July 1, 2019''': [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Detailed_logarithmic_timeline&diff=prev&oldid=904299424 Eric Kvaalen restored it again] with the hidden note that remains to this day.
My best argument for its removal is that I believe it may constitute [[WP:OR|original research]]. However, I would like to see where consensus might stand on this matter. – [[User:MrPersonHumanGuy|MrPersonHumanGuy]] ([[User talk:MrPersonHumanGuy|talk]]) 15:12, 27 January 2024 (UTC)}}

The [[#Operation World, Joshua Project and Asia Harvest]] are databases of religion demographics related to the Christian missionary movement. OW and the JP are both edited by the Christian missionary Patrick Johnstone, while AH, which reproduces OW-JP statistics for Asia and China, is edited by the Christian missionary Paul Hattaway. The JP has been the subject of more than ten discussions on this noticeboard, with almost all comments finding it completely unreliable. The latest [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_361#RfC:_Joshua_Project|discussion with RfC in 2021]] decided its inclusion in the perennial sources' list as a generally unreliable source. Despite this, it is still widely used throughout Wikipedia (cf. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?limit=500&offset=0&profile=default&search=insource%3A%22joshuaproject.net%22&title=Special:Search&ns0=1 1]), and its associated projects OW and AH are also widely used (cf.

I think this should be done in [[Spillover of Israel-Hamas war]], because this article is mainly focused on events that occured Israel and Palestine territories, and it actually starts to become too vague for belligerents. This situation seems to become like [[Syrian civil war]] before, so I think it is best to minimize the belligerent as well.

{{rfcquote|text=
Two editors are having a dispute about the order in which the MAX 200 (a derivation of the MAX-8) and the MAX 10 should appear in the list.

One wants to list them in numerical order based on 200, the other based on 8.

Generally, manufacturers number aircraft types in chronological order of first production. One interesting exception is the Boeing 717 which post-dates the every Boeing aircraft except the 787. However, it is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Commercial_Airplanes#Orders_and_deliveries listed in numerical order in the list of Boeing aircraft] rather than date of first flight.

So the question here is which should we do here? Do we list in chronological order of first flight or in strict numerical order (given that the MAX 200, while a derivative of the MAX 8, is a separate model)? Another option would be to list by order of date that Ryanair ordered each model.[[User:Lard Almighty|Lard Almighty]] ([[User talk:Lard Almighty|talk]]) 07:29, 17 January 2024 (UTC)}}

The recent removal of both houses has been in reference to [[Talk:Frederik_X/Archive_1#Why_change_"House_of_Monpezat"?]] which took place well over ten years ago.

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
Are more general descriptions of climates acceptable on city/region climate sections if climate classification systems conflict?

Three options come to mind here:

* Option 1: Climate descriptions '''should not''' be generalized, even when classifications conflict. This leads to the structure given below being the only acceptable description:

Budapest has a [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa'') or [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Doa'') climate.

* Option 2a: Climate descriptions '''could''' be generalized, but this should be kept to  cases where intractable disputes form due to wording and/or climate type (see [[Talk:Budapest#Climate]] for example); therefore the structure given below would also be acceptable in certain circumstances:

Budapest has a [[humid temperate climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Doa'').<sup>1</sup>

* Option 2b: Much like 2a,  but without the dispute requirement. Climate types '''could''' be generalized '''at will''' as long as climate classifications conflict.


<sup>1</sup> Keep in mind that both Köppen and Trewartha place Budapest into a climate class within the scope of a [[humid temperate climate]] (humid subtropical and oceanic respectively). For some cities, the category might need to be broader; [[Portland, Oregon]] would simply have a [[temperate climate]] under this scheme, as that is the first level of intersection between Mediterranean and oceanic climates. Despite this, within the rules of [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] and [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]], a point of ''no'' overlap is mathematically impossible; and it is vanishingly rare to see another classification besides these two on a city page.

What is the reliability of sites owned by [[Red Ventures]] (excluding specific sites listed below)?

* '''Option 1: [[WP:GREL|Generally reliable]]'''
* '''Option 2: [[WP:MREL|Additional considerations]]'''
* '''Option 3: [[WP:GUNREL|Generally unreliable]]'''
* '''Option 4: [[WP:DEPREC|Deprecate]]'''

This proposal came up at a recent discussion of [[ZDNet]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard&oldid=1196942065#Something_strange_is_going_on_with_ZDNet]. While Red Ventures itself has been infrequently discussed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_398#Red_Ventures%27s_portfolio] prior to this RfC, sites now owned by it have been frequently discussed in the past, such as [[CNET]], [[ZDNet]], [[Healthline]], and others. For the purposes of keeping this RfC clear due to Red Ventures' enormous reach, this applies to content published by sites during the period of time they were owned by Red Ventures, so pre-acquisition content would be exempt. This RfC also excludes the following sources as they were previously discussed at [[WP:RSP]]:
* [[WP:CNET]], [[WP:MREL]] since being acquired by Red Ventures in October 2020, unreliable after November 2022
* [[WP:HEALTHLINE]], deprecated
* [[The Points Guy]], blacklisted and split between [[WP:MREL]] and [[WP:GUNREL]].
It also excludes sources sold by Red Ventures in 2022 to Fandom as they were identified in the previous discussion as possibly needing an exception due to frequent use/not spending that much time under Red Ventures. Examples include [[Metacritic]], [[TV Guide]], and [[Gamespot]] (which are considered generally reliable at [[WP:RSP]] and [[WP:GAMESOURCES]]). However, this RfC would apply to [[ZDNet]] and [[Lonely Planet]] as of the time they were acquired by Red Ventures. <span class="nowrap">[[User:Chess|Chess]] ([[User talk:Chess|talk]]) <small>(please [[Help:Talk pages#Notifications|mention]] me on reply)</small></span> 18:15, 24 January 2024 (UTC)}}

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
The words ''Black Irish'' have been used, at different times and places, to describe:

* Irish people with "white" skin and dark hair (as contrasted with the red-headed stereotype of Celtic people), such as [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Joan Jett]].  The description was also sometimes used for people with a similar appearance, e.g., [[Elizabeth Taylor]] [https://entertainment.time.com/2013/02/27/time-cover-celebrity-showbiz/slide/elizabeth-taylor/][https://www.imdb.com/list/ls562968045/] (who was not Irish).
* Irish people with "black" skin (e.g., immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa and their descendants), such as [[Ifrah Ahmed]], [[Kwaku Fortune]], and [[Adam Idah]].

The first group (e.g., black hair, blue eyes, pale skin) is the subject of this article.  At some times and in some places, this first group's appearance has been (incorrectly) explained with a story about Spanish sailors being shipwrecked in Ireland.  This story is not true, and is fairly described as a myth.

An editor would like to have this article begin with the words "The historic term '''Black Irish''' was a [[myth]]..."  Other editors would like the article to begin with words like "The '''Black Irish''' were [[people]] of Irish ancestry, having dark hair..." or "'''Black Irish''' is a common description of the [[Human physical appearance|appearance]] of white Irish people with dark hair...", and introduce the origin myth after the group of people has been identified.

'''Question:  Should the first sentence of this article describe the Black Irish as a myth, or as people?'''

Should the current map of Somalia on this page, which does not show the areas controlled by Somaliland be replaced? If so, in what way?

* '''Option 1''': Keep current map
* ''' Option 2''': Replace current map but with a map only highlighting rough boundaries of the areas de facto controlled by Somaliland in light of the current Los Anod conflict 
*  '''Option 3''': Replace current map with a map highlighting Somaliland's de jure borders
* '''Option 4''': Show a map of Somalia with its de jure borders, while also displaying one with its de facto borders.

It's worth noting there was an edit war on this issue back in December, resulting in the current version of the map being protected. [[User:ASmallMapleLeaf|ASmallMapleLeaf]] ([[User talk:ASmallMapleLeaf|talk]]) 15:50, 1 February 2024 (UTC)}}

For a while now [[WP:RFD]] has been flooded with nominations for redirects that a missing a space between the term and the opening parenthesis of a disambiguator (e.g. [[Constantine(video game)]] and [[Scaramouche(1952 film)]]), see for example sections 17 to 35 at [[Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2024 January 31]], sections 17 to 57 at [[Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2024 February 1]], and similar in the days leading up to them. These discussions invariably end up being deleted uncontroversially, and the number of discussions is causing issues for RfD (see e.g. [[Wikipedia talk:Redirects for discussion#Can we reduce the number of RfDs transcluded on this page?]]). Accordingly I propose a new speedy deletion criterion R5:<br>
'''Redirects with no space before a parenthetical term''', e.g. "Foo(bar)", "Joe Smith(disambiguation)". This does not apply to terms that will correctly or plausibly be searched for without spaces, e.g. [[501(c)(3)]]
*''Before'' nominating a redirect under this criterion:
**Create the correctly spaced version as a redirect to the same target if it would make a good redirect but does not exist
**Adjust any incoming internal links to point to the correctly spaced version. 
*This criterion does not apply if the redirect is the result of page move made less than 30 days ago, but criteria [[WP:CSD#R3|R3]] and/or [[WP:CSD#G6|G6]] may apply. 
The rationale for the last bullet is to allow time for mirrors, etc. to catch up. If the page was moved and then immediately moved again, or created at this title then quickly moved then this title was obviously created in error and G6 applies.

The page says "CGI characters are only included if they are portrayed as visually distinct from their live-action surroundings—otherwise, the majority of live-action movies which use CGI visual effects would be included." However, that's a very unclear statement on what that means. I fail to see how [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]] meets that requirement, but [[Avatar (2009 film)]] and films in the MCU don't. I do think there is a distinct difference between a hybrid animation/live-action film and a live action film that uses CGI for visual effects, but I cannot think of an objective way to determine the difference. I'm hoping that someone can think of a clearer definition. <span style="color:green;">[[User:JDDJS|<span style="color:green;">JDDJS</span>]] ([[User talk:JDDJS|<span style="color:purple;">talk to me</span>]] • [[Special:Contributions/JDDJS|<span style="color:purple;">see what I've done</span>]])</span> 16:18, 6 February 2024 (UTC)}}

Following {{re|Computment}}'s comment I did a little research and found out he was indeed correct. The Yemen's size is 455,000 km2 as can be seen on this entry in Encyclopedia Britannica: [https://www.britannica.com/facts/Yemen]. I published a YT video outlining all reasons for this mistake: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNR2namiS9o link]. The mistakes I noticed impact a lot of wikipedia pages, including: [[Yemen]], [[Geography of Yemen]], [[South Yemen]], [[Yemen Arab Republic]], [[Kingdom of Yemen]], [[Geography of Yemen]], [[List of countries and dependencies by area]], [[List of Asian countries by area]], [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia]], [[Governorates of Yemen]] and probably more.

I know my video contains a lot of original research and doesnt meet wikipedia standards for a source so I decided to start a RfC and seek consensus on this topic. [[User:Borysk5|Borysk5]] ([[User talk:Borysk5|talk]]) 15:16, 9 February 2024 (UTC)}}

There is extremely inconsistent infoboxes for the casualties in the war and subsequent articles. So, let's have the discussion to solve this here to prevent further edit wars and disagreements.

Should this article and all subsequent articles (child articles) of the [[Israel–Hamas war]] include "Per Israel" and/or "Per Hamas" in an infobox casualty statistic when it comes from [[Israel]] or [[Hamas]]?

For some background, [[OKO.press]] is mentioned or cited on 129 articles across English Wikipedia. After a talk page discussion on [[Visegrád 24]], it was mentioned that the source may not be reliable. Given this source is cited in CTOPS articles (including [[Disinformation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine]], LGBTQ articles, and Israel-Hamas war articles), an RFC is needed to reassess reliability.

{{rfcquote|text=
There appears to have been some misunderstandings above about what archiving a citation means (see [[WP:DEADREF]] for the current language and [[WP:ARCHIVEEARLY]] for the process, see [[WP:LINKROT]] for some reasons why archiving is a good idea). Just to reiterate, it '''does not''' mean replacing existing {{para|url}} with a link to Archive.org/Wayback Machine. It means filling the {{para|archive-url}} and {{para|archive-date}} parameters and setting {{para|url-status|live}} for links that are not presently dead (see {{tl|cite web}} for more details on the parameters and how they interact). While my reading was that creating such archive URLs was strongly encouraged, there appears to be a consensus that the current language ''does not even say that''. However, what I would propose is not explicitly '''requiring''' archive links, but perhaps language here that effectively disallows individual pages from banning the practice altogether. I can't really see where having them causes any harm to our editors or our readers, and the benefits of having them far outweigh the arguments against including them. 

All that being said, please indicate whether you '''Support''' including language that would forbid individual pages from creating a [[WP:LOCALCON]] to disallow archive links, or whether you would '''Oppose''' such language. —[[User:Locke Cole|Locke Cole]] • [[User talk:Locke Cole|t]] • [[Special:Contributions/Locke Cole|c]] 04:33, 27 March 2024 (UTC)}}

After doing thorough research, I have found out that the WikiProject for Roads allows 10 significant junctions. Normally, this isn’t an issue but for a highway as long as I-90, there are a lot of junctions and there has been constant edit warring and talk page discussions over what junctions to include. I am proposing the following 

*'''Option A:''' Status quo
*'''Option B:''' Merging I-5 and SR-519 together, since they are right next to each other and we have done similar combination of junctions when they don’t exactly intersect in the same spot, see [[U.S. Route 20]] and the merger of I-87 and I-90, and how [[U.S. Route 11]] combines the junction of I-76 and I-81 despite not being in the exact same spot.
*'''Option C:''' Replace the second I-80 junction with another unique road, such as the I-87 junction in Albany, the I-29 junction in Sioux Falls, or even the concurrency with I-39. 
*'''Option D:''' Use IAR to allow 11 junctions.

Some of these options contradict each other, but feel free to support multiple options that don’t contradict or offer your own opinions. [[User:RoadFan294857|RoadFan294857]] ([[User talk:RoadFan294857|talk]]) 23:00, 29 February 2024 (UTC)}}

What is the reliability of Allkpop for K-pop-related articles?
* '''Option 1: [[Wikipedia:GREL|Generally reliable]]'''
* '''Option 2: [[Wikipedia:MREL|Additional considerations]]'''
* '''Option 3: [[Wikipedia:GUNREL|Generally unreliable]]'''
* '''Option 4: [[Wikipedia:DEPREC|Deprecate]]'''

Allkpop is the English-language K-pop and celebrity gossip site and fan blog owned by 6Theory Media, which also owns Tokyohive. The site contains extensive Korean culture-related news coverage and rumours that are aimed at non-Korean audiences, this does not itself as a generally reliable source and also claims to be cited by major news organizations. They also made occasional interviews and special reports, which counts as first-hand journalism. It also licensed to stream [[Mnet Asian Music Awards|MAMA Awards]]. I consider the site itself was generally unreliable for K-pop articles.

==RFC on Wikipedia policy on the reporting of expunged criminal records'''

Most US jurisdictions, including the state of Virginia where most Wikipedia servers are, permit the [[Expungement in the United States|expungement]] of certain criminal records. Most democratic countries have similar arrangements, for example the UK and Australia allow for many offences to become [[Spent conviction|'spent']]. The purpose of expungement, or 'spent' status, is to allow offenders a "second chance" (see article), particularly in respect of employment and other opportunities. The effect is to permit offenders to deny their expunged offences in many circumstances, and to constrain reporting on them without good reason (the fact of their existence is by definition not of itself sufficient reason). In the US, it is a misdemeanour in some states to report without good reason (acceptable reasons are laid out in relevant legislation); in the US and UK it is a tort to report without good reason. Should Wikipedia permit the reporting of expunged/spent convictions in our articles, and if so what criteria for such inclusion should apply?[[User:Charlie Campbell 28|Charlie Campbell 28]] ([[User talk:Charlie Campbell 28|talk]]) 08:36, 4 April 2024 (UTC)}}

There are four questions:
#Should the article integrate the trivia that the article is an example of the Ship of Theseus in the form of a hypothetical example that explains the concept of the Ship of Theseus? Example: [[Special:Diff/1212574348]]
#Is the trivia even true? 
#Alternatively, should the trivia be integrated another way?
#Additionally and separate from the trivia question, should the article include an example of the thought experiment in the first place?

{{rfcquote|text=
So I was looking over a few articles and noticed that Timelash is labeled a serial despite only being two parts, as are other two parters in classic who. eg. [[The Edge of Destruction]], [[The Ultimate Foe]], and most other season 22 stories. 
However, with New who two part stories are all labeled as two part stories and not serials, eg. [[Spyfall (Doctor Who)|Spyfall]], [[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]], [[World Enough and Time (Doctor Who)|World Enough and Time]]&[[The Doctor Falls]]. Now the answer you might be inclined to give is New Who gives each episode a different name which is not always true Spyfall/End of Time, or that Classic Who labels them all parts and not names once again not always true Edge of Destruction.
<br/>
So is there any meaningfull difference between Timelash and Spyfall to make a distinction or is just an arbitrary or stylistic choice. <b>[[User talk:OlifanofmrTennant|Questions?]] [[Fourth Doctor|four]] [[User:OlifanofmrTennant|Olifanofmrtennant (she/her)]]</b> 03:44, 14 April 2024 (UTC)}}

One editor wants the last paragraph to be changed to the following, as he believes both the Kearney and Manogaran sources have "accepted" the reasons attributed by Sansoni for the riots, whereas other editors believe that those sources are merely summarising Sansoni's reasons, and are not personal approvals. Do you agree with the proposed change below?

{{tqb|Following his inquiry, Justice Sansoni submitted his report, which was known as the "Sansoni Report" to President Jayewardene in July 1980.<ref name="presidential commission" /> 

Over the years the Sansoni Report has been recived diffrent reviews. Robert N. Kearney found that the Sansoni Report explained the riots in terms of "Sinhalese reaction to Tamil separatist demands, terrorist acts committed in the name of separatism, and anti-Sinhalese statements allegedly made by Tamil politicians in the course of the 1977 general election campaign".<ref name="Kearney">{{cite journal |last1=Kearney |first1=Robert N. |date=March 1986 |title=Tension and Conflict in Sri Lanka |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/45315688 |journal=Current History |volume=85 |issue=509 |pages=110}}</ref> According to Chelvadurai Manogaran, the Sansoni Report attributed many factors as the cause of the riots, including "TULFs anti-Sinhalese proganda advocating separatism, Sinhalese extremists' statements claiming that Tamils intended to wipe out the Sinhalese and acts of violence committed by the liberation Tigers". The immediate cause of the violence Manogaran finds is rumor of Sinhalese policemen been attacked in Jaffna by Tamil militants.

Currently, the status quo for events listed on the main page is to use the present tense, even if the event in question has definitively ended. I didn't really notice this was an issue until yesterday when I noticed that the main page said that the [[Solar eclipse of April 8, 2024]] is visible through parts of North America. Knowing that it was '''not''' currently visible and double checking that the article referred to the event in the past tense, I changed this to '''was''' visible. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:In_the_news&diff=prev&oldid=1218143475] I did not realize that this is against the current consensus at [[WP:ITNBLURB]] which says that these events must always be described in the present tense. If one is interested in further background, I encourage them to read this discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Main_Page/Errors&oldid=1218192091 here] (scroll down to errors).

I think that this status quo is misleading to readers because it cases like this, we are deliberately giving inaccurate and outdated information. I believe this is a disservice to our readers. The eclipse is ''not'' visible anymore, yet we must insist that it is indeed visible. I think that we should also be consistent... If the article for a blurb is using the past tense, we should use the past tense on the main page. Therefore, '''I propose that events listed on ITN that have definitively ended should be described in the past tense if it would otherwise mislead readers into thinking an event is ongoing.'''

This page has a fairly large section that takes up about half of the page detailing a list of times that space marines have appeared in fiction. I removed the section on the basis of it being unsourced, [[WP:FANCRUFT]], and for it being an [[WP:INDISCRIMINATE]] list of [[WP:TRIVIA]]. However, this edit was reverted because an editor thought that this section was "very different" from other pop-culture sections. Instead of engaging in an edit war, I would like to make a request for comments to decide if the section should be removed, stay, or if some other solution can be decided on. Thanks.

Should we add Rowling's [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/jk-rowling-india-willoughby-twitter-gender-b2507309.html comments on India Willoughby] from March 2024 to the end of the second paragraph of [[J._K._Rowling#Transgender_people|views -> transgender people]] before the paragraph as a whole is rewritten? I am proposing that we (only) add a short summary of the fact she did misgender Willoughby on Twitter and a short quote of one of the comments she made (see examples I have proposed elsewhere in this talk page). It would have a maximum length of two sentences. Subsequent developments after her comments themselves (police report etc) would not be included. The comments Rowling made on Willoughby in March are separate from those made on several transgender people including Willoughby on April Fools' Day. I'm almost certain her comments in March were the first times Rowling publicly misgendered a trans person. This would not include Rowling's additional recent comments on trans people in Nazi Germany, or other recent (separate) topics related to her views on trans people.

Should Female finishers be recorded separately for the Barkley Marathons?

A number of related questions have come up on this article in the past few days due to Jasmin Paris recently becoming the first woman to complete the Barkley Marathons. Most sporting events keep stats separately based on gender but the Barkley Marathons don't make this distinction as they aren't part of any kind of larger organization or used as qualifiers for anything. 

It's important to note that the table originally came from a discussion on labeling her time as the "slowest finish", a metric often recorded for fixed time races but could be seen as demeaning the first woman to finish the race to outsiders. Input on that subject is also appreciated. [[User:PyropePe|PyropePe]] ([[User talk:PyropePe|talk]]) 03:29, 27 March 2024 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I noticed that a contributor has changed the lead section of the [[Liverpool]] article just recently. The Liverpool lead section now only includes Liverpool's local authority population and the population of the official city region. Having looked at the [[Birmingham]] [[Leeds]] and [[Edinburgh]] articles, I notice that their lead sections make reference to the wider metropolitan area. 

To quote the Birmingham article lead section: "The wider metropolitan area has a population of 4.3 million, making it the largest outside of London." The citation is worldpopulationreview.com

To quote the Leeds article: "The city is part of the fourth-largest built-up area by population in the United Kingdom, West Yorkshire Built-up Area, with a 2011 census population of 1.7 million" The citation is ONS Census 2011. The WY Built-up Area is out of date and is not calculated any more. But I am wondering if this needs to be in the lead section as an editor has removed mention of Liverpool metropolitan area from its lead section. 

To quote the [[Edinburgh]] lead section, "The wider metropolitan area has a population of 912,490." The citation is OECD.

I am sure there are many many examples on wiki where city articles make reference to a wider 'urban region' or metropolitan area.

Should we be aiming for consistency in these articles? I have also started an RfC on the Leeds, Birmingham and Liverpool articles. [[User:Liverpolitan1980|Liverpolitan1980]] ([[User talk:Liverpolitan1980|talk]]) 10:40, 4 May 2024 (UTC)}}

There is ongoing discussion about how to best present the content of the ''Insider investigative report'' on a Russian connection to Havana Syndrome. Two versions have been proposed, and we seek wider community input on which should be included in the article.

'''Version 2.1:'''
{{talkquote|On March 31, 2024, ''[[The Insider (website)|The Insider]]'', in collaboration with ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', published an investigative report reigniting speculation that hostile Russian action was responsible for the syndrome.<ref name="kremlin-dismisses">https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-dismisses-report-russia-behind-havana-syndrome-2024-04-01/</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web |title=Havana syndrome: Report links mystery illness to Russian intelligence unit |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68706317 |access-date=2024-04-02 |website=www.bbc.com}}</ref> The Kremlin Press Secretary dismissed the report as "nothing more than baseless, unfounded accusations by the media." In response to the report, the White House Press Secretary said that a "foreign adversary is very unlikely." Following the report, several U.S. Senators, including [[Susan Collins]], [[Jeanne Shaheen]], and [[Mark Warner]], sent a letter to the President calling for further investigation into the cause of the anomalous health incidents.}}

'''Version 3.1:'''

Three related questions:

a) Can this article include non-medical information about Havana Syndrome (provided the information is properly sourced)? Examples of non-medical information include politics, economics, relationship to cold war, espionage, directed energy weapons,  statements by foreign governments, conflict-of-interest allegations, and historical chronology of hypotheses & research.  Example of non-medical information:  Financial compensation from ''Havana Act'' <ref name=BarnesOct8>{{cite news |first1=Julian E. |last1=Barnes |first2=David E. |last2=Sanger |first3=Katie |last3=Rogers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/us/politics/havana-syndrome-biden-law.html |title=Biden Signs Legislation to Compensate Victims of Mysterious 'Havana Syndrome' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211018154415/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/us/politics/havana-syndrome-biden-law.html |archive-date=October 18, 2021 |work=The New York Times |date=October 8, 2021}}</ref> and <ref name="Collins Bill">{{Cite web|date=May 25, 2021|title=S.1828 - HAVANA Act of 2021|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1828/text?r=3&s=1|publisher=United States Congress|access-date=June 25, 2021|archive-date=June 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210625134327/https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1828/text?r=3&s=1|url-status=live}}</ref>.

b) Can this article include USA government reports, studies and statements from the executive branch, US Congress, CIA, Department of Defense, State department, National Institutes of Health, etc. (provided they are reported on by major media)? Specifically, is it okay if some sources are ''not'' from medical or scientific journals?   Examples of government reports:  <ref name="JASON2021">{{cite web |title=An Analysis of Data and Hypotheses Related to the Embassy Incidents |url=https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/JASON-Study-Revised_10-February-2022-Redacted_V1.1.pdf |website=state.gov |publisher=United States Department of State |access-date=October 19, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221014084219/https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/JASON-Study-Revised_10-February-2022-Redacted_V1.1.pdf |archive-date=October 14, 2022 |language=en-US |date=February 10, 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref> and  <ref>"Most ‘Havana Syndrome’ Cases Unlikely Caused by Foreign Power, C.I.A.

c) For medical information in this article:  does [[WP:MEDRS]] prohibit the use of primary medical sources in this article?  Opposing view: Havana Syndrome is relatively new and evolving so it is okay to use primary medical sources in some situations (for example,  when the primary source is widely reported in major media; or when the primary source is reporting a significant new result; or when there are no secondary sources yet available that have reviewed and summarized the primary source).

I noticed that a contributor has changed the lead section of the [[Liverpool]] article just recently. The Liverpool lead section now only includes Liverpool's local authority population and the population of the official city region. Having looked at the [[Birmingham]] [[Leeds]] and [[Edinburgh]] articles, I notice that their lead sections make reference to the wider metropolitan area. 

To quote the Birmingham article lead section: "The wider metropolitan area has a population of 4.3 million, making it the largest outside of London." The citation is worldpopulationreview.com

To quote the Leeds article: "The city is part of the fourth-largest built-up area by population in the United Kingdom, West Yorkshire Built-up Area, with a 2011 census population of 1.7 million" The citation is ONS Census 2011. The WY Built-up Area is out of date and is not calculated any more. But I am wondering if this needs to be in the lead section as an editor has removed mention of Liverpool metropolitan area from its lead section. 

To quote the [[Edinburgh]] lead section, "The wider metropolitan area has a population of 912,490." The citation is OECD.

I am sure there are many many examples on wiki where city articles make reference to a wider 'urban region' or metropolitan area.

Should we be aiming for consistency in these articles? I have also started an RfC on the Leeds, Birmingham and Edinburgh articles. [[User:Liverpolitan1980|Liverpolitan1980]] ([[User talk:Liverpolitan1980|talk]]) 10:40, 4 May 2024 (UTC)}}

There seems to be controversy regarding the founding date of AT&T Corp.

This page has always stated AT&T Corp’s foundation date as 1885 until the last couple days, when a user has changed it to 1877 out of the belief that AT&T Corp. was founded as Bell Telephone Company in 1877. While corporate lineage could be traced to 1877, there is already a page for [[Bell Telephone Company]] which describes that company prior to its 1899 acquisition by its subsidiary. AT&T Corp.’s history is quite distinct from that of the Bell companies that eventually spun off, and of course post-divestiture AT&T was forbidden from using the Bell name (sans Bell Labs) and logo.

{{rfcquote|text=
The current IPA pronunciation listed is /vɔːʃ/. What is up for contention is the vowel. The vowel in the current IPA transcription is a long open-mid back rounded vowel, /ɔː/, which is the [[non-rhotic]] "or" sound, or "l'''aw'''" in [[Received Pronunciation|RP]]. I disagree with this vowel being the IPA transcription, and shall explain.

Here is the IPA vowel chart with audio to listen to how the vowels sound (note, there are differences within accents);

{{IPA vowels|audio=yes}}

First, the vowel in 'Vaush' is definitely a rounded vowel, so there's not really a dispute there. It is also a long vowel, which should be noted when evaluating the vowel.

There a few (non-joke{{Efn|For example, "vowsh" and "voosh" are both known joking mispronunciations in the community|group=lower-alpha}}) options for the vowel which I shall list, then evaluate each in turn.

: option 1: /ɔː/, the current transcription, [[non-rhotic]] "or" sound, or "l'''aw"''' in [[Received Pronunciation|RP]]. Ipa transliteration is "vorsh".
: option 2: /ɒː/, as in "th'''ough'''t" but long (with the [[low back merger]], without the merger "th'''ough'''t" is /ɔː/)
: option 3: /ɒ̃ː/, as in "'''en''' passant" (but long), in [[Received Pronunciation|RP]] 


Option 1 (current IPA transcription): first, the pronunciation of "vorsh" is used as a joking spelling of a mispronunciation within the community; this is the pronunciation used by creators such as, [[Carl Benjamin]], and is noticably different from the pronunciation used by Vaush himself and the [[:File:Vaush pronunciation.mp3|pronunciation in the article]]. If you say "vaush" in the correct way, you can feel with your tongue that the vowel is an open vowel, rather than an open-mid vowel.

Option 2 vs Option 3: The distinction between these is nasalization. You can tell that the vowel isn't nasal, because if you do it then hold your nose the vowel sound remains the same. 


So I think it should be /vɒːʃ/.

I'm making this an RfC, so; here are the RfC options. Feel free to add more if the IPA transcription you support isn't listed.
: '''option 1''': /ɔː/
: '''option 2''': /ɒː/
: '''option 3''': /ɒ̃ː/

Contentious topics are constrained and tagged per [[WP:CTOPICS]].  They are, by definition, controversial and so will generate additional contention and work at DYK compared to ordinary topics.  The editing restrictions applied to these topics also tends to make resolution of disputes difficult, protracted and slow.  As DYK is oversubscribed, it may not need this aggravation.  The question is whether we should add a rule to [[WP:DYKCRIT]] making contentious topics ineligible for DYK?

Should the first two paragraphs of the lede be framed? The lede currently reads:
::''"'''Magical thinking''', or '''superstitious thinking''', is the belief that unrelated events are causally connected despite the absence of any plausible causal link between them, particularly as a result of supernatural effects.''

::''Examples include the idea that personal thoughts can influence the external world without acting on them, or that objects must be causally connected if they resemble each other or have come into contact with each other in the past. Magical thinking is a type of [[Logical fallacy|fallacious]] thinking and is a common source of invalid [[causal inference]]s. Unlike the [[Correlation does not imply causation|confusion of correlation with causation]], magical thinking does not require the events to be correlated.''

::''The precise definition of magical thinking may vary subtly when used by different theorists or among different fields of study. In [[anthropology]], the posited causality is between religious [[ritual]], [[prayer]], [[sacrifice]], or the observance of a [[taboo]], and an expected benefit or recompense.''

::''In [[psychology]], magical thinking is the belief that one's thoughts by themselves can bring about effects in the world or that thinking something corresponds with doing it. These beliefs can cause a person to experience an irrational fear of performing certain acts or having certain thoughts because of an assumed [[correlation]] between doing so and threatening calamities.''

::''In [[psychiatry]], magical thinking defines false [[belief]]s about the capability of thoughts, actions or words to cause or prevent undesirable [[Event (philosophy)|events]]. It is a commonly observed symptom in [[thought disorder]], [[schizotypal personality disorder]] and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]"''

Define the threshold in national polls to include candidates in the infobox

'''You must only choose one option.'''

A) 15%

B) 10%

C) 5%

I believe that a previous RfC that addressed the minimum number in national polls that candidates should have to be included in the infobox is ambiguous and don't provide a clear and solid consensus. Several of the users who participated in that RfC did not fully decide on 5% or 10%

I think the threshold in polls must be 15% nationwide, the same threshold that the Commission on Presidential Debates imposes on third party candidates in order for them to participate in debates. Third party candidates tend to be above 5% in the months leading up to the election and drop off as election day approaches. A very clear example was candidate Gary Johnson in 2016. In the months leading up to the election polls consistently showed him above 5%, there were even several polls that had him above 10%. However, Gary Johnson only received 3% of the nationwide vote.

I would like to restart a previous RfC on calling the operation a Hamas victory in the infobox. In the interim, multiple other sources ([[https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-attack-hamas-biden-8ffb1a81e6769bb1d27c849e6108da36 1]], [[https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2024-04-09/ty-article/.premium/has-hamas-won/0000018e-c21d-d1b7-a3af-e71f0f590000 2]]) have supported this position. No consensus was reached in the past RfC however I think the decision then was erroneous. Most of the opponents had no compelling arguments except essentially appeals to emotion that the attacks were "terrorist" and that it would somehow be immoral to call "terrorists" winners. That RfC was further tainted by an e-mail canvassing situation. I believe that the closer erred in his judgement of no consensus. {{Ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha

I think it's time for us to have this discussion. 

I propose that the apartheid allegation be explicitly mentioned in the lead. This is an [[Israel and Apartheid|incredibly well-sourced]] allegation, and I think the current lead which vaguely talks about "crimes of humanity" and "war crimes" is avoiding the core of the issue  — precisely ''which'' crime is Israel being accused of? Apartheid is the principal one. 

Specifically, I propose that the current version "{{tq|Israel's practices in its occupation of the Palestinian territories have drawn sustained international criticism along with accusations that it has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity against the Palestinian people from human rights organizations and United Nations officials.}}" be replaced with "{{tq|Israel's practices in its occupation of the Palestinian territories have drawn sustained international criticism. It has been accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, including the crime of apartheid, against the Palestinian people from human rights organizations and United Nations officials.}}" [[User:JDiala|JDiala]] ([[User talk:JDiala|talk]]) 00:17, 19 April 2024 (UTC)}}

Hi everyone, this RfC is to retrieve consensus regarding the addition of mission outcome to the Orbital/Intergated launch wikitable, as well as adding the associated chart in the same section.

'''Context:''' IFT-3 has ben the subject of confusion and debate here in Wikipedia. The confusion between Launch outcome and Mission outcome has led editors to think of the two as one, despite those being different things. This article also doesn't show the launch outcome alongside mission outcome, meaning editors and readers alike might see the green "success" entry in the launch column/chart and believe the mission succeded, not reading the other text to learn that the mission wasn't a full success. This factor will lead to confusion among Wikipedia editors, and confused editors can't properly write a wiki.

'''The question:''' Should we list the mission outcome as clearly as we list the launch outcome? 

If you wish to dispute this RfC, please raise your concerns over at the appropriate [[WP:DRN]] and [[WP:PUMP]] noticeboards. You may also bring this discussion up at [[WP:DfD]] and [[WP:AN]], and if all discussions go wrong or end up with no real result, you can contact the [[Wikipedia Arbitration Committee]]. But bear in mind, contacting the Arbitration Committee is a last resort option that should not be done for minor reasons, so only contact them if the discussions go '''very''' wrong.

Good day, I am new to wikipedia (4 days old right now) which means that I am not 100% familiar with coding citations and not sure which kind of sources to use for citations. I believe this topic about "light skin" is related to science specifically biology or anatomy not sure.  I recommend reading the full page talk page here: 

I wanted to add a new topic and i prefer to discuss this with a different contributor (i recommend a contributor who knows a lot about topics related to human body especially skin pigmentation types or skin tones or skin undertones) because there is a user named Biosaurt who refuses me to edit that small part of the article, he wants his edits to stay and all I just wanted to do is to improve some teeny tiny parts of the article. I reason I ask for Rfc is because the talk page isn't active and I dont want to engage in dispute or edit-warring risks, instead I would like this to be finally resolved. I need assurance about this from any fellow contributor who knows a lot about my topic. And I am always keen on improving the article, I really hope this discussion would be in a neutral point of view, constructive, and non-biased. 

#1: Are these published sources i have found valid? 

1) Skin phototype of average korean:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5597652/#:~:text=Among%20Koreans%2C%20according%20to%20the,mechanical%20trauma%20or%20laser%20treatment
 
2) another published study about the skin type of average korean: https://www.koreamed.org/SearchBasic.php?RID=2303247

3) average skin type of japanese, https://www.biteki.com/skin-care/trouble/299606. The source is in japanese language not english, i will provide the translated text here: 

4) another different study of skin type found in average chinese: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16869866/

is citation merging the 2 published studies i have found about average skin phototype in koreans possible as well? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Citation_merging

#2: Now there is a portion on article that says "Light skin is most commonly found amongst the native populations of Europe, East Asia," 

is it preferred to write it as "parts of East Asia" or leave it as "East Asia" only? because according to the 2 published studies Biosaurt founded as well as the published sources I have founded above, majority of them commonly fall somewhere near the moderate skin phototype (which is type III, some are IV) based on both Biosaurt's sources and the sources I have found as well.

2 out of 3 SOURCES Biosaurt published which is correct, he only cited 2 sources about Chinese, 1 about Korean, none for Japanese. That's why I wanted to cite sources as long as there are texts about skin pigmentation.

NOTE: THIS RFC HAS BEEN REWORDED. 

OLD RFC Question: <small>There is an ongoing editorial dispute on this page as to the use of the word 'Genocide' in the article's lede.

Should the word 'Genocide' be used in the lede of this article?</small> 

NEW RFC Question: There is an ongoing editorial dispute as to the wording of the article's lede.

Which of the following drafts for the lede is preferred?

A: The Black War was the genocide of Aboriginal Tasmanians in Tasmania by British colonists from the mid-1820s to 1832.

British settlement spread rapidly over the traditional lands of the Aboriginal people. The conflict was fought largely as a guerrilla war by both sides; some 600 to 900 Aboriginal people and more than 200 British colonists died. Scholars classify the event as an instance of settler colonialism and an instance of genocide against Indigenous peoples. The author of the concept of genocide, Raphael Lemkin, considered Tasmania the site of one of the world's clear cases of genocide and Hughes has described the loss of Aboriginal Tasmanians as "the only true genocide in English colonial history".

B: The Black War was a period of violent conflict between British colonists and Aboriginal Tasmanians in Tasmania from the mid-1820s to 1832, as British settlement spread rapidly over the traditional Aboriginal lands.

The conflict was fought largely as a guerrilla war by both sides; some 600 to 900 Aboriginal people and more than 200 British colonists died. The event has been retrospectively described as an act of genocide by the British colonists.

C: The Black War was a period of violent conflict between British colonists and Aboriginal Tasmanians in Tasmania from the mid-1820s to 1832, as British settlement spread rapidly over the traditional Aboriginal lands.

The conflict was fought largely as a guerrilla war by both sides; some 600 to 900 Aboriginal people and more than 200 British colonists died. The near-destruction of the Aboriginal Tasmanians and the frequent incidence of mass killings have sparked debate among historians over whether the Black War should be defined as an act of genocide by the British colonists.

D: The Black War is a term used to refer to the violent conflict Aboriginal Tasmanians in Tasmania and British colonists from the mid-1820s to 1832. This conflict has been characterised retrospectively by many historians as a form of genocide.

British settlement spread rapidly over the traditional lands of the Aboriginal people. The conflict was fought largely as a guerrilla war by both sides; some 600 to 900 Aboriginal people and more than 200 British colonists died.

This page is currently hitting the [[WP:PEIS|post-expand limit]], meaning that the templates used to display the missing Wikipedians' names stop working midway through the {{tq|W}} section. This is resulting in the editors' names not being displayed, and instead being replaced with (e.g.) {{tqq|[[Template:User2]]}}. I therefore think this page should be split, but I'm not quite sure what the best way of doing it would be.

A few possible ideas that came to my mind were:
# Should this page be split into subpages for the starting letter of editors' usernames? (To match the way the page is currently organised)
# Should the page be split into subpages for the year an editor's last edit was made <ins>(or another timeframe)</ins>? (In a similar vein to [[Wikipedia:Deceased Wikipedians]])
# Should this page simply be split (e.g.) in half?

I welcome any feedback and opinions on this proposal, as well as other ideas for how best to split this page. All the best, &zwj;—&zwj;[[User:A smart kitten|a&nbsp;smart kitten]]<sub>[<nowiki/>[[User talk:A smart kitten|meow]]]</sub> <sub>RFC tag added 13:07, 3 May 2024 (UTC)}}

There has been edit warring over the past weeks over whether or not to use the wording of "Indo-Muslim" in the lead, particularly in the first sentence. (see rev [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mughal_Empire&oldid=1224577943 1224577943] for example) There was a previous discussion over whether or not to include it [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mughal_Empire#Mughal_empire_Indo-muslim?] but little consensus was achieved, perhaps on the side of not including it but the opposing side kept adding the wording. The wording was later moved to the second paragraph of the lead [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mughal_Empire&oldid=1225236552] but this may be controversial as well.

# Use the wording of "Indo-Muslim" in the first sentence as done in revision [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mughal_Empire&oldid=1224577943 1224577943]
# Mention the wording of "Indo-Muslim" later on in the lead but not in the first sentence as done in revision [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mughal_Empire&oldid=1225236552 1225236552]
# Do not use the wording of "Indo-Muslim" at all.

Would it be good to have clearer guidelines on the usage of the "criminal charges" parameter? Criminal charges appear to be much like wedding engagements. They are short-lived preludes to longterm events: Convictions or marriages (write your own joke :) 

Considering charges can be dropped against someone, would making the guidelines clearer to limit charges to only those that actually resulted in criminal prosecution? (Whether acquitted or found guilty.) If not, what examples could there be of someone having a '''lead-level''' fact relating to a criminal charge that was dropped and didn't result in criminal proceedings (that are not currently ongoing)?

Recently, from the two discussions (one a few sections above this one and the other on [[Talk:Tornadoes of 2024]]), I have a proposal for the new layout, taking in feedback from those involved in those two discussions.

#Change (revert) the layout from the currently used ''By Continent'' (example: [[Tornadoes of 2023]]), to the original ''By Month'' (Example: [[Tornadoes of 2008]]).
#"(United States)" will be added to U.S.-based events, which was not done in original ''By Month'' layouts.
#U.S.-only things will be left out of the infobox at the top of the yearly page (Infobox example [[Tornadoes of 2023]]). However, monthly U.S. totals can (and should) be mentioned at the beginning of each months section. Information regarding other countries or regions (example: number of European tornadoes or number of China tornadoes) during the month should also receive a sentence at the beginning of each months section.
::In short, a small "monthly global summary" opens the section.

The guideline currently states that the "criminal_charges" parameter is "What the criminal is accused of (note that this is different from what the criminal is -- later -- convicted of)". Obviously the person can't be a criminal if they've only been ''accused'' of a crime, or even ''charged'' with one. However this Infobox seems to be restricted to use with notable ''convicted'' criminals. So this would imply that "criminal_charges" in this case relates solely to crimes they are currently ''wanted'' for (ie. which they have not been tried for yet).

I think there's a chance this parameter could be used to list charges that did not lead to convictions after being processed in the legal system (either because they were dropped, dismissed or otherwise found not-guilty). A short note could help clarify the correct use cases: 

"What the criminal is currently wanted to be tried for. Do not list charges that were dropped, dismissed or which went to trial and did not lead to conviction."

In a recent AfD ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Samuel Alito flag display controversy]]), the outcome was to merge that article into this article. I performed the merge, only to have another editor, unaware of the AFD decision, revert the entire merge. This material has been restored per the AfD decision. Since its inclusion may be controversial, I've opened this AFD to determine:

{{rfcquote|text=
I am the lead author of this article.

Between [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wat_Paknam_Japan&oldid=1229192737 this edition] I have written and some of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wat_Paknam_Japan&oldid=1229195919 editions] ahead, many texts were removed by @Theroadislong as " promotional ".

While I understand some aspects of this deletion, there are many aspects that I do not understand. I would appreciate opinions and explanations on this from a few people, if possible.

Before I go any further, let me clarify my position: I am a non-religious person who just interest in [[Ethnic Church]] and have no vested interest in this institution. Also, the University of Tsukuba paper that forms the core of this article is an architectural thesis and probably has no vested interest in this facility.

* about The flow of worship is as follows

I think some people may feel that the flow of worship is unnecessary, but I think it is exceptional for a Thai temple because it incorporates a way of worship that is rooted in Japanese ideas, even though it is a facility for Thai people. The source of this method of worship is not an information magazine or flyer, a paper, and I guess it was described in the paper because the researcher thought it was worthy of special mention.

* about Differences from Thai Temples

I think this section is one of the most distinctive passages in the original paper, showing how Thai religious culture has changed to adapt to Japan. I have no idea what in the world is promotional about this section. I really don't understand it, so if possible, I would appreciate it if someone could elaborate on this.

* festivals and rituals

While I have a certain understanding of what was considered promotional about the food offerings, I do not understand why the information on the ratio of nationalities of the participants was removed. The ratio of nationalities of participants in ethnic church ceremonies is obviously important information I think.

* about Relationships with Local Communities

It is also not clear why the reference to community relations was deleted. In my opinion, information on community relations would be beneficial, as new religious institutions from different cultures often cause friction with the local community.

Information about the municipality's introduction to the local community of poems composed by citizens is another indication of the relationship between the institution and the local community.

* about receive the precepts

Information about fulfilling the requirements for receiving the precepts by the five monks was removed also does not make sense to me. I personally consider the point that whether or not an organization can clone itself to be of mortal importance. I have no idea what is advertised about this statement either and would appreciate an explanation if possible.

I would very appriciate to get third-party opinions on my questions above from a few editors who have experience in religion-related articles. If many of them agree that the text is propagandistic and deserves to be removed, I will accept that as a fact.

Should penguins be represented by one image or a collage in the lead?

Penguins are not complicated folks.

That is a good enough representation of penguins for the lead. Not every group needs a collage. We've got the rest of the article to show their diversity. I personally think there should be a wider discussion on when collages are needed. They tend to make it harder to focus on one image.

On the order, wording, and framing of the three definitions in the first paragraph of the lede, which currently is:
::''Atheism, in the broadest sense, is an absence of belief in the existence of deities. Less broadly, atheism is a rejection of the belief that any deities exist. In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities.''
It has been stipulated that the middling definition is more commonly found in dictionaries and among the general population and should have primacy, and that the status quo gives the broad definition [[WP:Undue weight]], however the broad definition is supported by a plurality of recent academia and its primacy allows for a natural procession into narrower definitions.

An alternative might be:
:: ''Atheism is the absence of or rejection of belief in the existence of a god or gods. In a narrower sense, atheism is the position or belief that there are no deities.'' (needs to be edited slightly)

{{rfcquote|text=
I have noticed that a new convention has formed regarding the ideology parameter, which is to only put one or two all-encompassing ideologies (see [[Labour Party (UK)]]). It used to be the case that the ideology parameter had five or so more specific entries that gave the reader a good impression of the party at a glance (see [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]). 

In light of this, I think a 'Key positions' parameter would be a good addition which has, say maximum five entries which editors agree on, including regarding their order, and they would be based on citations from recent academia. The policy on this could distinguish between social, economic, national, and international positions to ensure a wide coverage. A national one could be say Unionism for a UK party, and an international one could be Euroscepticism for a European party. 

The name 'Key positions' is problematic as there are political jobs also called positions, however I can't think of a better term. Maybe 'Political positions'?

Amid additional citations, reformatting, correction, and improvement of a stub article amounting to a rebuild, {{ping|Johnbod|p=}} (apparently snarky because of unpleasantness at [[Talk:Jingdezhen porcelain]]) performed his own "drive-by" series of reverts to maintain the previous unlinked, malformatted, and bloated mess in the citations in the name of {{sc|[[wp:citevar]]}}, undoing several of the article's other edits and improvements along the way. With the personal attack and inaccurate edit summary, it certainly seems personal but even on the merits the previous version doesn't seem to be any consistent citevar to maintain, the rebuild and improvements should cover changing it anyway, and (if the consensus really is to maintain 30 separate cites for the same points) it certainly ''seems'' like {{sc|[[wp:overcite]]}} needs it cleaned up ''somehow''.

One or both of us need additional eyes and comments on the page to clean it up one way or the other.

{{rfcquote|text=
The Sun was a broadsheet newspaper published in the United Kingdom from 1964 to 1969. It was a replacement for a similar broadsheet newspaper called the [[Daily Herald (United Kingdom)|Daily Herald]], which it resembled. It was owned by the International Publishing Corporation and the Mirror Group. Rupert Murdoch and Kelvin Mackenzie had ''nothing'' to do with it. In 1969, it was replaced by a very different and disimilar tabloid newspaper with the same name, called [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]], which was owned by Rupert Murdoch. That tabloid newspaper has an entry in WP:RSP located at [[WP:THESUN]]. Unfortunately that entry fails to indicate whether it applies to the previous broadsheet newspaper, and the broadsheet newspaper does not appear to have been discussed during previous discussions of "The Sun" at RSN. We need to decide whether the broadsheet newspaper published from 1964 to 1969 is reliable, so that the entry at [[WP:THESUN]] can be clarified.

Accordingly this Request for Comment asks:

What is the reliability of the national daily broadsheet newspaper published in the United Kingdom from 1964 to 1969 called ''The Sun''?

* '''Option 1: [[Wikipedia:GREL|Generally reliable]]'''
* '''Option 2: [[Wikipedia:MREL|Additional considerations]]'''

There exists an opinion in [[WP:Identifying and using tertiary sources]] which to me makes a lot of sense. However, it is an opinion and there is no corresponding statement in the policy, [[WP:PSTS]], which states that: "Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources, and to a lesser extent, on tertiary sources and primary sources." Except in special cases I would consider tertiary sources as below primary, albeit balance is needed. Sometimes tertiary sources are too simple and hence misleading, the [[lie to children]] phenomenon. I think the language should be changed to be clearer.

I propose adding to the end of the policy statement at [[WP:Tertiary]] the sentence.
:''Secondary sources are always preferred over tertiary ones.''

Should the ancient kingdom of Macedon be described as Greek at the time of Alexander the Great? 

If you have time, please read the arguments in the references in footnote (d) in Alexander the Great's page already posted online above (''see'' "Questioning Alexander the Great's identity) but if you do not have much time, please focus on Fine (1983) who summarizes modern scholarship as "almost unanimously recognizes them as Greeks" but did not qualify the timeline and did not use the phrases "reached consensus" nor "reached unanimity".

Based on the references in footnote (d), the debate regarding this matter has been ongoing for decades among historians but only references that sided with the argument that the ancient Macedonians were Greek are included in the references in footnote (d).

I am not a historian, hence, I do not have access to published books nor to scientific journals. My only references are from tertiary, but reputable, sources: (1) from MIT.edu that states: "all historians admit that '''by Roman times''' the ancient Macedonians were fully homogenized with the rest of Greeks, and that Macedonia stopped existing as a separate socio-cultural entity some 600 years before any contact with the first Slavs in the Balkans."; (2) Encyclopedia Britannica and (3) National Geographic Society, the latter two of which describe the kingdom of Macedon on the topic Alexander the Great as "ancient", not "ancient Greek".

Two editors above argue that the MIT.edu source is dated and was published "during the Clinton administration".  I do not know exactly when the MIT page was published.

In addition, the two editors claim they have consensus, because there are two vs. one (me) and based on this consensus, the "ancient <u>Greek</u> kingdom of Macedon" is the proper description. 

As a compromise, I asked the two editors to add a subtopic under Alexander the Great's page that describes the debate among historians that includes both arguments, and revert to "ancient" to describe the kingdom of Macedon until the historians have reached consensus on this matter.

There has been a long-running slow-motion dispute on this page regarding the list of tour dates for the supporting album tour that ran from February 4 to July 22, 2023.

The project page, [[WP:CONCERT TOUR]], says that for an article on a concert tour, "{{tq|Tables may be used to present tour date information, such as dates, venues, locations, and opening/support acts}}". However, the essay, [[WP:ALBUMSTYLE]], says, "{{tq|Concert tours are not always notable enough to warrant stand-alone articles (see [[WP:NMG#Concert tours]]). Instead, information about notable tours and festivals should be incorporated into either the artist's page, or the album article for which the tour is supporting. Do not list all dates here, instead mention the range of dates (ex. June–September 1992)}}".

Neither of these pages are policy, but they leave gray the question of how to treat a concert tour that is arguably notable enough to have a separate article, but can arguably more concisely be presented to the reader as a section of an article on the album being promoted through this tour.

{{rfcquote|text=
[[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Years/Archive_10#"Year_of..."_bias_in_e.g._20BC|This has been briefly and unclearly mentioned before]] but '''the current treatment of Chinese dating in our year by year infoboxes is nearly entirely mistaken.''' Yes, the [[sexagenary cycle]] is real and important to mention. 

'''A. No, Yellow Emperor dates aren't really a thing, the way they're being presented.'''

I mean, sure, they're a thing in the ''exact'' same way AUC dates are. They're a fad some people went through in the 19th & 20th century, largely based on the mistaken idea that ''other'' important people had used them. The Romans actually almost entirely used eponymous consular dating. The Chinese actually entirely (except for that fad still somewhat upheld on almanac-style Chinese lunisolar calendars) used imperial era names.

It's a more valid notable system than the Discordian calendar we keep as lagniappe from Wiki's fun early days, sure, but it's entirely {{sc|[[wp:undue]]}} to treat it as ''the'' Chinese year now and just a {{sc|[[wp:lie]]}} to treat it as ''the'' Chinese year in any historical context. It's fine to keep but it absolutely needs to be labeled (YE, AH, AHD, whatever) to clarify what it is, which ''isn't'' the "Chinese calendar year".

'''B. No, we don't need to include two Yellow Emperor dates.'''

There's a [[Chinese calendar#Epochs|list of different epochs]] on our [[Chinese calendar]] page. No, the other ones aren't as notable (especially in English) as YE dating and don't need to be included in the infobox. However, absolutely none of them involve a computation that even remotely produces an equivalent year 4514/4515 for AD 2024. 

The same section of the same page includes what I think the second "Chinese year" in the infobox is trying to do: In 1905, the Jiangsu provincial government used a system that would've made 2024 the year 4514/4515 if anyone still used their system. Per cursory Googling in English, we're the only ones who seem to and we should just stop. Unless the second system is actually still prominently used (which the article should be changed to discuss), no, it isn't important to cover variant YE dates any more than [[Founding of Rome#Chronological disagreements|all the variant AUC dates]] or [[Marianus Scotus#Works|Marianus Scotus's variant AD computation]] that was popular for a while in the 12th century.

'''C. Yes, we absolutely need to include the [[List of Chinese era names|era dates]].'''

Like the Greek and Romans, '''[[List of Chinese era names|actual Chinese dating was based on regnal eras]]'''. Years in some periods like the [[Northern and Southern Dynasties]] had more than one era name and both should be included. Years were double counted as the last year of a dying emperor's reign and the first year of his successor's; both should be included. Reigns before the Han dynasty without formal era names should just list the regnal names (or conventional regency name) standard in Chinese historiography at least as far back as the Eastern Zhou. We could simply omit less certain regnal years before that or include conventional dates from a single system along the same lines as the calculation of the Yellow Emperor's reign in the first place; we don't seem to include footnotes on questionable eras for the other sections but could for those if people felt strongly about it.

In any case, there's at least 2000-odd years of an established dating system being used by roughly a fourth of humanity that we aren't mentioning or even vaguely hinting at. We should fix that.

'''D. Eh, the "Minguo calendar" is simply the continuation of the exact same system''',

switched over to Gregorian months and years. I get why you might not want to include it in the "Chinese year" section after 1949 and why that means not including it before 1949 either. Fact remains that it's literally the exact same system, using the people's government as the new eternal era name. Similarly, as far as our article on the [[Republic of China calendar]] knows, it isn't used for dates before 1912. '''Our template currently '''('''mis''')'''uses it for ~3000 years before 1912''', at least as far back as [[719 BC]]. It's possible some people have used it that way, which should be added to our article. It's certainly uncommon and the infobox shouldn't be using it for any of those earlier years at all, just like we don't have a Juche calendar date for 1900.

'''E. No, we shouldn't have a separate name for the ROC era.'''

The Minguo era page might very well be in the wrong place. The discussion for its move from [[Minguo calendar]] to [[Republic of China calendar]] was very short and apparently based on misreliance on misplacement of the [[Juche calendar]] page to "North Korean calendar". Whichever is right, though, our infobox and the page should be using the same name for the same epoch.

Single slashes are widely used in Linguistics to indicate [[Phoneme|phonemes]]. Our transcription system for English (cf. [[Help:IPA/English]], [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Pronunciation]]) does not use phonemes, but [[Diaphoneme|diaphonemes]]. Nonetheless, we are enclosing the transcriptions in single slashes (mainly through {{tl|IPAc-en}}, e.g. <span class="IPA nowrap">[[Help:IPA/English|/<span style="border-bottom:1px dotted"><span title="/ˈ/: primary stress follows">ˈ</span><span title="'w' in 'wind'">w</span><span title="/ʊ/: 'u' in 'push'">ʊ</span><span title="'s' in 'sigh'">s</span><span title="'t' in 'tie'">t</span><span title="/ər/: 'er' in 'letter'">ər</span></span>/]]</span>). This non-standard use of single slashes confuses readers and editors alike and regularly leads to disputes, for instance the recent edit war in [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]].

What could we do?

# We could stop the non-standard use of the single slashes by using a different delimiter to enclose our diaphonemic transcriptions, preferrably a delimiter used outside of Wikipedia such as double slashes. A transcription might look as follows: <span class="IPA nowrap">[[Help:IPA/English|//<span style="border-bottom:1px dotted"><span title="/ˈ/: primary stress follows">ˈ</span><span title="'w' in 'wind'">w</span><span title="/ʊ/: 'u' in 'push'">ʊ</span><span title="'s' in 'sigh'">s</span><span title="'t' in 'tie'">t</span><span title="/ər/: 'er' in 'letter'">ər</span></span>//]]</span>.
# We could keep the single slashes and change our transcription system to be phonemic, thus restoring the standard meaning of the single slashes.
# We could do nothing and keep our non-standard use of the single slashes to enclose diaphonemes.

This request for comment is a follow-up to the recent bold replacement of the single slashes by the {{sc2|DOUBLE SOLIDUS OPERATOR}} ⫽. It was soon reverted after protest on [[Template talk:IPAc-en#What's with the double slashes?]] There had been a previous consensus on this page to use double slashes, cf. [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Pronunciation/Archive 11#Distinction between varieties of English]]. --[[User:J. 'mach' wust|mach]] [[User talk:J.

{{rfcquote|text=
I propose renaming the article "Sikkimese language" to "Bhutia language." The current title "Sikkimese language" can be misleading, as it may imply that it refers to all languages spoken in Sikkim. The term "Bhutia language" is more precise and accurately reflects the language spoken by the Bhutia community in Sikkim.

**Reasons for the proposed change:**
1. **Clarity:** The term "Bhutia language" specifically identifies the language spoken by the Bhutia people, avoiding confusion with other languages spoken in Sikkim.
2. **Common Usage:** The term "Bhutia language" is commonly used in linguistic and cultural references, whereas "Sikkimese language" can be ambiguous.

I would appreciate the community's feedback on this proposed change.

Thank you for your input. [[User:Kkk1996|Kkk1996]] ([[User talk:Kkk1996|talk]]) 17:27, 10 July 2024 (UTC)}}

As most editors who have been active in AfD discussions for some time have noticed, AfD has seen a decline in participation in recent months. A couple of editors, me included, have also seen a couple of issues with AfD, some of which discourage editors from participating in discussions. Is it time to start thinking of new ways to change the AfD process? This could include new/deleted things, or changed policies. I'm sure that some editors have seen issues with AfD that they'd like to see change, or have ideas on how to gather more participants that would need consensus before they are implemented. If there is sufficient support for such a reform, my idea would be to conduct it as follows:

* <u>Phase 1</u> ---> Open for proposals. Gather new ideas on what could be changed. If there is sufficient support on a proposal, it is moved to phase 2.
* <u>Phase 2</u> ---> Refine each proposal (so that the most people can agree with them) in sub-discussions.
* <u>Phase 3</u> ---> Formally propose each proposal in a sub-RfC.
* <u>Phase 4</u> ---> Implement the proposals that are validated.

Therefore, "{{tq|it is clear the discussion has run its course}}" for approximately 42 days (inclusive of the approximately 14 days since the RfC started). There is a clear consensus for the proposed "Debut and disbandment" method.

Hence, what now?
# Wait for Legobot to remove the {{tl|Rfc}} tag in approximately 18 days before implementing?
# Request proper closure at [[Wikipedia:Closure requests]] (though it may be rejected due to #1 of the listing requirements) before implementing?

Does a picture of Al Jolson in blackface belong in this article?

There is currently a picture of Al Jolson in blackface in this article, with the caption: "Al Jolson in The Jazz Singer (1927), an example of typical minstrel blackface, which influenced some early cartoon characters—evidently including Mickey, who adds white gloves." This is supported by one sentence in the article: "Several sources state that this scheme [wearing white gloves] evolved from blackface caricatures used in minstrel shows." That sentence is fine, but I think the picture of Jolson adds undue weight to a minor and speculative connection to blackface. I would like to take the picture of Jolson off of this page.

Are states at [[Fermi level]] equivalent to metallic conduction (and vica versa)?

[[User:Sandbh|Sandbh]] is claiming that they are not equivalent, and that similarly the opposite of having no states at the [[Fermi level]] is not equivalent to a non-metal (i.e. insulator/semiconductor etc) which does not conduct electricity, creating an edit war. This is in both [[Nonmetallic materials]] and [[Metals]]. The sources quoted are [[Ashcroft and Mermin]] and [[Kittel]], the relevant chapters as (obviously) the Fermi-Dirac statistics and conduction is more complex than one sentence. It seems that [[User:Sandbh|Sandbh]] considers anything that is a paraphrasing as [[WP:OR]], only direct quotes can be used. Unfortunately [[User:Sandbh|Sandbh]] appears to never have had any training in solid state physics.

{{rfcquote|text=
This RfC is a continuation of the discussion regarding the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 UK general election]] and the question on which parties to include in that page's infobox. For some context, there has been a longstanding debate on whether UKIP - which received a seat and was the third most voted for party - should be listed. Currently, the consensus from the [[Talk:United Kingdom general election, 2015/Archive 7#Request for Comment: Which Infobox? (Choice of Two)|most recent RfC]] on the topic is to not include UKIP, but the inherent controversial nature of this decision has meant that debates and occasional edit-wars have sprouted up in the years since, with no full resolution in sight.

This RfC is hopefully an attempt to solve this controversy and to provide more clarity to the longstanding [[Wikipedia:Five percent rule|5% rule guideline]] surrounding election infoboxes.

The main questions to be discussed are:

*What criteria, hard or soft, should be met by parties to be included in an infobox? This includes having >5% of the popular vote, earning a parliamentary seat, media noteworthiness, etc. Along with this, are there times that a party meeting some or all of these criteria should ''not'' be included in the infobox? If so, why, and when?
*Should the 5% rule, or some approximation of it, be applied to parliamentary elections? There have been discussion held on this topic in [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Elections and Referendums/Archive 20#RfC: Expanding 5% infobox threshold|2021]] and [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Elections and Referendums/Archive 24#RfC: Clarify the 5% rule for parliamentary elections|2023]], but no formal consensus on whether it should actually apply in some form, either weakly or strongly, to parliamentary election infoboxes has occurred.
*How should the choice between the {{[[Template:Infobox election|Infobox election]]}} and {{[[Template:Infobox legislative election|Infobox legislative election]]}} templates be made? Should it be contingent on >9 parties meeting all the criteria listed above, or should it be more dependent on local conditions? There are inconsistencies between countries - and even between different elections of the same country - on the infobox style used, so it would be valuable to have this issue more formally clairfied.

{{Hatnote|Please keep this discussion to changing the hatnotes on the TPE article and not others to prevent this from being closed and moved to [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject UK Railways]] as what happened to above. Also, this discussion will only effect the TPE page and not others.}}

Since the discussion to make [[Class 360]] and [[class 755]] was settled a short while ago (links to [[Talk:Class 360 (disambiguation)|360]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Class_755|755]] discussion respectively), I think the same needs to be said over here. The hatnote currently says:
{{about|the operator from 2023|previous franchisees|TransPennine Express (disambiguation)}}
I tried to changed it to:
{{about|the 2023 operator|the former operators|TransPennine Express (2016–2023)|and|First TransPennine Express}}
before being reverted. I now need to see if I reach an agreement to change it to the proposed hatnote (one that links the former TPE companies directly) from the current one that links to [[TransPennine Express (disambiguation)]], like what happened when I tried to make 360 and 755 a redirect to the UK rolling stocks, both were reverted, and both reached an agreement. There was a discussion above but to settle but to no avail. Therefore, I think a request from other users are helpful like in the two other cases.

Ten years have passed since the last discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nikola_Tesla/Nationality_and_ethnicity/Archive_3#RfC:_Should_Tesla's_birthplace_be_changed?]. The appearance of new sources merits a new discussion.

The present text in the article stands: '''"Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present-day Croatia)" '''

The sources provide additional context which describe the birthplace '''"at that time"'''
# '''"Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in Smiljian in the province of Lika in what is today Croatia. At that time, a portion of Croatia was the military frontier district of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the area was referred to as Vojna Krajina ..."''' Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electric Age, p.13
# '''"the village where Tesla was born, is in the province of Lika, and at the time of his birth was a dependent province held by the Austro-Hungarian Empire as part of Croatia and Slovenia."'''. O'Neill (1944), page 12

The RfC questions are:
# Was Tesla's birthplace a part of Croatia (at the time of Tesla's birth), which was at that time a part of Austrian Empire
#*As opposed to the interpretation given by some editors which opinion was that, although nowadays (in 21st century) a part of Croatia, Tesla's birthplace wasn't a part of Croatia at the time of Tesla's birth (in the 19th century)
# Should we include that additional context in the article by adding the following sentece from source 1: " At that time, a portion of Croatia was the military frontier district of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the area was referred to as Vojna Krajina"

I believe the previous discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Brothers_of_Italy#RfC_on_neo-fascism_in_info_box_3_(Effectively_option_4_from_RfC2) here] was not all that productive (it didn't involve all that much analysis of sources, and there was only I believe 4 or so active editors in the discussion (which is why I've added the RFC template to this discussion)), and that the main argument to remove it was incredibly weak; that argument being, "A majority (or a lot) of sources do not describe the party as neo-fascist." '''That. does. not. matter.''' Said sources often describe the party as national conservative and or right-wing populist. These are not mutually exclusive with fascism, infact, right-wing populism is one of the core tenets of fascism. (13, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism#Umberto_Eco here] which links to right-wing populism.) Nor is national conservatism mutually exclusive with fascism, and in fact italian neo-fascist parties (most notably MSI) are listed as also being national conservative here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_conservatism#Defunct_or_formerly_national_conservative_parties,_or_parties_with_national_conservative_factions here]. '''Please do not repeat this argument.''' Sources merely not labelling the party as neo-fascist do not matter, '''what does matter, however''' is the sources which outright reject the neo-fascist label. There are plenty of sources that don't describe birds as being dinosaurs, but that doesn't mean they aren't. Additionally, sources highlighting the parties roots in fascism are not neccesarily rejecting that they curron ently are, instead it's merely highlighting the historical aspect.[[User:A Socialist Trans Girl|<span style="font-family:default;color:#246BCE;">A Socialist</span>]] [[User talk:A Socialist Trans Girl|<span style="font-family:default;color:#FF1493;">Trans Girl</span>]] 07:20, 7 July 2024 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Should the first sentence contain the term 'genocidal killing' and/or 'genocidal massacre'? The article as a whole is in some ways separated from events preceding and following, which confounds the chronology somewhat. Nonetheless, for the period of time as has been defined ''(which isn't exactly idiosyncratic)'' events from July 11-31 1995, as conventionally understood as the "Srebrenica genocide" and/or "Srebrenica massacre", are neither limited to 'genocidal killing' or 'genocidal massacre'. This is reflected in the article and sources, which document, for example, the rape of women and children, and continued deportation/forcible relocation of citizens of Srebrenica.

Neither the phrases "genocidal killing" nor "genocidal massacre" are expressly used in the sources linked as support for the phrase, which has been added and removed in various edit wars for the past several days – the terms are potentially [[WP:OR]], and certainly non-exhaustive. However, they are typically understood as excluding the aforementioned additional actions which are recognized as part of the Srebrenica genocide, such as when in other contexts the terms "genocidal killings and rape", "genocide and rape", imply different things. See also the article [[genocidal rape]] and the concerns which it brings up.

I submit that it's simply easier and more concise to go with the formulation {{tq|The Srebrenica massacre, also known as the Srebrenica genocide, was the July 1995 genocide...}} Of course, the entire sentence has formulation issues – it goes on to say {{tq|of more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys in and around the town of Srebrenica, during the Bosnian War}}, but as it currently exists, and in the hopes of putting an end to an edit war and making some progress in conversation, it seems necessary to take it a step at a time.

On the articles for Olympic events, should the venues hosting them be referred to by their regular corporate-sponsor name or their generic name that those venues use specifically for the Olympics? An example to follow would be the articles for [[Ice Hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics]], where the larger of the venues is referred to as "Canada Hockey Place" in the infobox instead of its sponsored name at the time "General Motors Place".

On this article, PeeJay insists on using only the regular sponsored name of the finals arena, under the belief that Wikipedia is not beholden to the IOC's sponsorship rules. PeeJay has ''not'' done this with the Gymnastics at the 2024 Olympics articles, however. I'm not going to bother re-inserting the generic name again, because then PeeJay will just drag me into an edit war.[[User:Jim856796|Jim856796]] ([[User talk:Jim856796|talk]]) 22:16, 11 August 2024 (UTC)}}

I would like to seek a third opinion regarding this subject matter. The user @[[User:Wahreit|Wahreit]] has been quite attached to the narrative of the IJA 3rd Division's involvement in this battle, asserting it with a number of low quality cherry-picked generally non-academic sources which often do not provide citations for their claims. As seen above and many times before I have tried to explain in detail why these sources do not hold up and conflict with more reliable sources. In spite of this they have been frequently overriding my edits and also trying to interpret Japanese sources which it seems they can't understand and are unwittingly asserting false claims with them. I have been trying to correct these incorrect changes but I want to avoid edit-warring.

This dispute is not limited to this page but also the [[Defense of Sihang Warehouse]] page as well, where the disputed matter is largely the same. As I see it, the Japanese sources clearly demonstrate this notion of the IJA 3rd Division's participation to be incorrect. Regardless of being primary sources, I don't see how there is room to assert this claim when the actual participating units are well documented in Japanese. I have been simply translating records and using zero synthesis to reach my conclusions. It is documented that the IJA 3rd Division was at the bank of Suzhou River trying to cross it when this happened. It is documented that the IJN's Special Naval Landing Forces were the ones involved in the attack on Sihang Warehouse. The only counterclaims @Wahreit has provided are western sources in which 5/6 did not even provide citations for their claims (and half had no citations at all!).

It would be great if someone else can offer their opinion, especially if they can read Japanese sources. I know the heavy use of primary and Japanese language sources is far from ideal on my side as well.

Adachi

One of organizations apparently getting financing from Singham's network was named in the report specifically as NewsClick. It said NewsClick's coverage presented a positive image of China and at times resembled talking points of the Chinese government.

{{rfcquote|text=
In many articles about [[WP:BLP|living persons]], and particularly about persons in positions of authority, e.g. member of parliament, corporation CEO, city councilor, etc, the lead paragraph often uses the verb "to serve" in denoting the person's work." E.g. "Ms Smith serves/has been serving/has served as member of the XYZ Board of Directors." In [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style#Tense_of_verbs_referring_to_current,_ongoing_events|this related discussion]], the issue was raised about the potential for meaningless excess in that term's use. (Here's a [[Wikipedia:Location,_location,_location!#WP:AREYOUBEINGSERVED|useful essay]] on that.) This, of course, applies to biographies about persons no longer living.

Comments are invited on the following options:

*'''A''' Use any simple form of "to be," e.g. "Smith is Acme Ltd auditor."
*'''B''' Continue to use "serve" in biographies, e.g. "Smith serves as Acme Ltd auditor."

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
While browsing through articles on subdivisions of [[Cologne]] with the intention of adding translations from German Wikipedia, I noticed that the terms used to translate different levels of subdivision are inconsistent across these pages. The overview article [[Districts of Cologne]] translates {{lang|de|Stadtbezirk}} as "(city) district", and {{lang|de|Stadtteil}} very literally as "city part". Articles about individual {{lang|de|Stadtbezirke}} on the other hand, like [[Lindenthal, Cologne|Lindenthal]] and [[Rodenkirchen]] instead render {{lang|de|Stadtbezirk}} as "borough" and {{lang|de|Stadtteil}} as either "(city) quarter" "city part".

By way of comparison, articles on [[Berlin]], which calls its top-level subdivisions {{lang|de|Bezirk}} and its second-level subdivisions {{lang|de|Ortsteil}} (which meanings do not differ substantially from {{lang|de|Stadtbezirk}} and {{lang|de|Stadtteil}}), uses "borough" for the former and "locality" for the latter.

This is confusing in several different ways:

* Readers may take a minute to work out that what some articles call a "borough" is the same thing other articles call a "district".
* The literal translation "city part" for {{lang|de|Stadtteil}} sounds vague and doesn't really convey any scale or significance to the reader. It also sounds a bit "awkward" to my mind. The term "locality" used for {{lang|de|Ortsteil}} is less awkward, but no less vague.
* The use of "quarter" for ''Stadtteil'' is wholly nonsensical as the ''Stadtteile'' themselves can be further subdivided informally into {{lang-de|(Stadt)viertel}} / {{lang-ksh|Veedel}}, which literally translates as..."(city) quarter". Berlin articles use "neighbourhood" for such further, informal subdivisions of their ''Ortsteile''.

I would like to propose the following consistent approach for the subdivisions of German cities:

* {{lang|de|(Stadt)bezirk}} or other top-level division to be rendered as '''borough'''
* {{lang|de|Stadt-/Ortsteil}} or other second-level division to be rendered as '''district'''
* {{lang|de|Viertel}} or other (usually informal) third-level division to be rendered as '''neighbourhood''' except in proper nouns{{ref|1|note}} (e.g. {{lang|de|Severinsviertel}} → "Severin Quarter", {{lang|de|Belgisches Viertel}} → "Belgian Quarter")

Subjectively, as a binative of English and German, this is what seems most intuitively comprehensible/evocative, but there are also objective reasons speaking for it:

# The [https://www.stadt-koeln.de/leben-in-koeln/stadtbezirke/index.html City of Cologne's official web page on its subdivisions] alongside [https://www.stadt-koeln.de/artikel/68982/index.html this official map of {{lang|ksh|Veedel}}] uses precisely this borough-district-neighbourhood schema while retaining "quarter" for proper nouns ([https://www.stadt-koeln.de/leben-in-koeln/planen-bauen/bebauungsplaene/63948/index.html example])
# Berlin likewise officially uses [https://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/en/the-senate/political-structure/ "boroughs" for {{lang|de|Bezirke}}] and [https://www.berlin.de/en/districts/ "districts and neighbourhoods" for {{lang|de|Ortsteile}} and their subdivisions]
# The borough-district schema has also been used for translating [[Stockholm]]'s top-level {{lang|sv|stadsdelsområden}} and second-level {{lang|sv|stadsdelar}}, the latter even being cognate with {{lang|de|Stadtteile}}.

However, I didn't want to charge ahead and make these changes without first inviting comment to see if there might be any good reasons this isn't already what's used across the board. So...what do other editors think? --<span style="font-family: Lucida Handwriting, Lucida Calligraphy, Bradley Hand ITC, cursive; font-size:90%;">[[User:Newbiepedian|Newbiepedian]]</span>&nbsp;([[User talk:Newbiepedian|talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/Newbiepedian|C]] · <span class="plainlinks">[https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools-ec/?user=Newbiepedian&project=en.wikipedia.org X!]</span> · [[Special:Log/Newbiepedian|L]]) 12:13, 18 July 2024 (UTC)}}

To what extent should allegations that Ukraine violated the [[International humanitarian law]] (IHL) by utilizing civilian infrastructure for military operations be discussed in this article? I specifically focus on two separate matters.

It is claimed that in March 2022 Ukrainian soldiers utilized this nursing home, populated by elderly persons and disabled people, for military purposes contrary to IHL.

(2) The inclusion of a [[Amnesty International#Ukraine|controversial report]] by [[Amnesty International]] published in August 2022 that there is a "pattern" of Ukraine utilizing civilian infrastructure, including residential areas, for military activity, which they indicate may be a violation of IHL.

*'''Option B:''' Include only (1).

Should the redirect {{no redirect|2028 United States presidential election}} be tagged with {{tl|R with possibilities}} or not? That template automatically detects whether a draft exists, and indeed there is one at [[Draft:2028 United States presidential election]]. So, that would be a reason in favor of adding the template.

But the "{{Not done}}" comment at [[#Protected edit request on 10 August 2024]] above says {{tq|If there were possibilities at this point then it wouldn't be salted.}}, which I guess is a reason against adding the template.

So, which reasoning is correct, then, for this apparently controversial change that now needs an [[WP:RFC|RfC]]?

Excuse me, This is the latest photo of Trump that I proposed because when I saw the photo of Trump that I proposed previously, many people thought that the background of the photo was strange, the tie was yellow, and the face was arrogant because he was not smiling. Therefore, I propose this new photo of Trump which has an upright body and a straight head. In addition, the photo of Trump that I proposed has a smiling face and his teeth are visible which is very fitting when juxtaposed with the photo of [[Kamala Harris|Harris]] who is also smiling and her teeth are visible. Then the photo that I proposed also has a background that is not strange and uses a red tie. For the problem of Trump's face looking old, of course because Trump is currently 78 years old. So I hope that the photo of Trump that I proposed will be used in the Wikipedia article. Thank you.

While trying to formulate my opinion on the subject, I found that neither discussion above (''Asking for consensus: Freeze in compromise version until discussion is resolved'' and ''Should Kamala Harris be listed as a "border czar"'') is very clear as to any proposed changes. So, I am making this section for !votes and discussion on specific versions. Here are the options (taken from the above discussions):
*'''Option 1:''' ''No mention.'' This is the state of the article at this moment.
*'''Option 2:''' ''Disputed mention.'' This new state would put "(disputed)" after Harris' name, with a footnote going into some depth concerning the history of Harris being called "border czar".
*'''Option 3:''' ''Normal mention.'' This was the original listing (note—by "original listing" is meant the original addition of the text to the page), with the only difference between Harris' and others' being a footnote stating that her presidential campaign has disavowed the title.
 
Option 2 was developed as a compromise between Option 1 and Option 3, given the unusual disagreement over the use of the title. Option 3 treated the media mentions of Harris as border czar as sufficient, followed by the chronologically later disavowal. The supporters of Option 1 have several justifications, mainly (so far as I can see) that the title has always been a source of controversy, ever since President Biden gave her the diplomatic responsibility, and that she has now formally disavowed the title. Wrapped up in this latter argument is the political connection, given that most people who want to bring up the "border czar" title are doing so to the detriment of her campaign.

{{rfcquote|text=
What units should be used for distances between [[star system]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]]? These are measured in [[light years]] (ly) in popular news and educational media; professional astronomers use [[parsecs]] (pc). Articles currently use a variety of units (some only ly and some ly converted to km) but most commonly use ly converted to pc in infoboxes (often automatically from technical data). If conversion to SI units (like kilometers) is not required in certain contexts, this would be added as an explicit exception to [[MOS:CONVERSIONS]]. The maximum distance in the observable [[universe]] is under 100 billion light-years, and interplanetary distances (inside a star system) are a fraction of a light-year and are measured in [[astronomical unit]]s (AU or au). 01:40, 28 July 2024 (UTC)}}

This RfC proposes to change references in the article from Serbian terms such as '''"Metohija"''' and '''"Šar Mountains"''' to their Albanian equivalents, '''"Dukagjin"''' and '''"Sharr Mountains"''', respectively. The article currently utilizes Serbian terminology that may not reflect the linguistic preferences of the majority of Kosovo's citizens, who predominantly speak Albanian. Over 90% of the population in Kosovo identifies as Albanian, making it imperative that the language used in the article accurately represents the voices and perspectives of the majority of its people.

Using terms that resonate with the local population aligns with Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] (NPOV) policy. The NPOV guideline emphasizes that articles should represent significant viewpoints fairly and proportionately. Since the Albanian language is the primary language spoken by the majority in Kosovo, adopting Albanian terminology helps to present an accurate portrayal of the region’s cultural and linguistic identity.

In conclusion, I propose to change the following terms in the article:
*'''Metohija → Dukagjin'''
*'''Šar Mountains → Sharr Mountains'''. [[User:Iaof2017|Iaof2017]] ([[User talk:Iaof2017|talk]]) 12:49, 28 August 2024 (UTC)}}

Hi,

According to [[MOS:FILMCAST]], common nouns within roles should not be capitalised to distinguish between character names and job descriptions. Currently, the use of sentence case introduces ambiguity for readers; for instance, it does not clarify whether 'Joker' refers to a character name or if 'Joker' describes his job when no character name is provided. I encourage you to refer to my related discussion with the user's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk%3AJoeyconnick#WikiProject_Actors_and_Filmmakers talk]. Therefore, I recommend adopting lowercase for common nouns in the Role field to ensure alignment with MOS:FILMCAST.

{{rfcquote|text=
There is a disagreement about whether Vince McMahon should be listed as the founder of WWE. Reliable sources indicate that he purchased the company from his father, Vince McMahon Sr., who founded it as Capitol Wrestling Corporation, which later became WWE. As such, sources clearly mention him buying the corporation, and then expanding it. In addition, this seamlessly aligns with the factual history of the WWE entity too (there is full documented/cited history of the company and its ownership). I am seeking input from other editors to determine whether the article should be updated to reflect this distinction.

'''Proposal:''' Please change "McMahon, along with his wife Linda, is a co-founder of the modern WWE,..." to "McMahon, along with his wife Linda, were the majority owners of the WWE,..."

While Vince McMahon is often credited as a "founder" of WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment), this designation overlooks the historical context of the company's origins and misrepresents McMahon's role in its development. Here are several key points to consider:

# '''Historical Context''': WWE was originally founded as the Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC) in 1953 by Vincent K. McMahon (Vince's father) and his business partner, Toots Mondt. Vince McMahon Jr. acquired the company in 1982, inheriting a functioning business with established talent and a regional fanbase.
# '''Business Expansion, Not Founding''': McMahon's significant contributions to the company lie in his strategic expansion and modernization efforts. Under his leadership, WWE transitioned into a global powerhouse, leveraging innovative marketing strategies, television deals, and event promotions. However, this does not equate to founding the company.
# '''Comparative Analysis''': The analogy with Elon Musk and Tesla is apt; Musk is often credited with transforming Tesla into a major player in the automotive industry but did not found the company. Similar to Musk, McMahon's impact was transformational rather than foundational.
# '''Recognition of Predecessors''': Acknowledging Vince McMahon as a "founder" diminishes the contributions of those who built the company before him. Recognizing his role as an owner and a pivotal figure in WWE's growth is important for a more accurate historical narrative.
# '''Terminology Accuracy''': The term "founder" implies the inception of an idea or business from scratch. Since McMahon took over an existing entity, a more accurate description would be "owner and architect of modern WWE."
# '''Terminology of "Modern WWE"''': Referring to Vince McMahon as a founder of "modern WWE" does not change the foundational history of the company. The term "modern" suggests a new era or transformation but does not negate the fact that he acquired an existing business. Thus, regardless of the era being referenced, the distinction between founding and ownership remains critical to understanding WWE's history.

In light of these points, I propose that we revise the language surrounding Vince McMahon's role in WWE to reflect his actual contributions more accurately, emphasizing that he purchased the company and played a pivotal role in its expansion, rather than founding it.

Hello,
Regarding Trump's main photo of "2024 United States presidential election", there were several discussions previously. - example link:
[[Talk:2024_United_States_presidential_election/Archive_7]]
I'd like to confirm which photos can be used. I've included the top-voted options based on my understanding, but I think limiting it to three additional choices will give us the most efficient results. If a new, better image emerges, we can compare it after this RFC process

:*For this RFC process, I propose that we only allow users to vote for one best photo for the Infobox  [[Donald Trump|Trump]]'s main photo. This will simplify calculations, as it's easier to determine the winner based on a single vote per user.

* '''Official'''
>Every U.S. elections always using official portrait but not in presidential primaries, for example, in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], Bill Clinton's official portrait was used for 2 times although two times were sequence 4 years ago.  weakness of this photo: considering that the age is a concern among some voters, the images of relatively recent can minimise that concern. Trump's 2017 portrait doesn't show a drastically different Trump/no change in appearance.
* '''Option1'''
>the long-standing "smug"  image; This can be seen as an unkind and arrogant, but on the other hand, it can be seen as a confident looking
*  '''Option2'''
>it is smiling freindly photo with his face,like Kamala  but  Trump's expression in the his body is tilted to the left instead of facing the camera.
*  '''Option3'''

>it is smiling freindly photo and suitable camerawork - example: at eye level, face and body facing camera and he is also smiling like Kamala but there's just an impression that makes him look uneasy.

{{rfcquote|text=
The purpose of this Request for Comment is to seek community consensus on whether the term '''the Christian Era''' should be included as an alternative full form of the abbreviation CE in the first sentence of the article Common Era.

Currently, the abbreviation CE is commonly understood to stand for "Common Era", which is widely accepted in both academic and secular contexts as a non-religious alternative to '''[[Anno Domini]]''' (AD). However, there is historical evidence that '''the Christian Era''' was used as a term synonymous with "Common Era" in earlier periods. Some editors argue that acknowledging '''the Christian Era''' as an alternative interpretation of CE would provide a fuller representation of the history and context of the term, particularly for readers interested in its religious or historical origins.

Opponents of this inclusion may argue that '''the Christian Era''' has fallen out of contemporary usage and may cause confusion, as CE is primarily used today in a secular context. Additionally, they may express concern that such inclusion could give undue weight to a religious interpretation that is no longer relevant to the modern usage of the term.

The community is invited to discuss the following question:

''Should '''the Christian Era''' and '''Before the Christian Era''' be included as an alternative full forms of CE and BCE in the first sentence of the article?''

Please provide your reasoning and any supporting sources or guidelines that may assist in reaching a consensus. [[User:Jeaucques Quœure|Jeaucques Quœure]] ([[User talk:Jeaucques Quœure|talk]]) 07:22, 5 October 2024 (UTC)}}

The current example under [[MOS:SANDWICH]] has an image depicting a lady with a bare breast. Although the images used for demonstration are less important than their arrangement on the page, using an image of a bare breast isn't inherently necessary to explain the guideline. While [[WP:CENSORED|Wikipedia is not censored]], certain images, especially those depicting nudity, may be off-putting to some editors, including new contributors or those with cultural, religious, or personal sensitivities to such content, potentially deterring them. With a different picture, the guideline could remain accessible to a wider audience without alienating potential editors. Thoughts?

Following the previous month's discussion at [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#Fringe Theories Noticeboard, religious topics, and WP:CANVAS]], the questions were raised as to the future of [[WP:FTN]] and [[WP:FRINGE]]:

'''Question 1''': Should [[WP:Fringe theories/Noticeboard]] (WP:FTN) be disbanded and deactivated? 
:Its existing functions may be moved elsewhere, at the discretion of editors. <small>Examples: FTN function could be moved to a WikiProject discussion page; it could handled by other policy noticeboards (namely RSN, NPOVN, NORN, BLPN, and AN).</small>

'''Question 2''': Should the Wikipedia guideline [[WP:Fringe theories]] (WP:FRINGE) be disbanded? You may give specific options for resolving guideline sections, including:
:2A. Downgrade WP:FRINGE from a ''guideline'' to an ''explanatory essay'';
:2B. Deprecate and archive WP:FRINGE guidelines altogether;
:2C. Merge sections of WP:FRINGE into the larger guidelines that refer to them:
::<small>Option 2C examples (this is a partial attempt at a comprehensive list): [[WP:V]] section REDFLAG cites FRINGE as main article; [[WP:RS]] has a "Fringe" section that cites PARITY; [[WP:N]] has a "Fringe" section citing NFRINGE; [[WP:NPOV]] has a "Fringe theories and pseudoscience" section as well as scattered citations to FRINGE and its various sections; [[WP:BLP]] does not cite [[WP:FRINGEBLP]], but FRINGEBLP cites BLP and NPOV.</small>

Affirm or reject either, both, none, with any number of suboptions (nothing must be mutually exclusive).

The current [[Hamas#Recognition_of_Israel|Recognition of Israel]] section contains the following elements:

1. '''Whether Hamas would recognize Israel is debated'''.[142][143][144] Hamas leaders have emphasized they do not recognize Israel,[77] but indicate they "have a de facto acceptance of its presence".[145] Hamas's acceptance of the 1967 borders acknowledges the existence of another entity on the other side.[130] Some scholars believe Hamas's acceptance of the 1967 borders implicitly recognizes Israel.[131][146]

2. '''According to Martin Kear, Israel treats "any form of resistance from Palestinians as acts of terrorism", and therefore responds to any resistance with extraordinary force. In contrast, writes Kear, Hamas operationalizes "...its resistance to Israeli occupation through its invocation of jihad ... Accordingly, Hamas refuses to recognise Israel as a legitimate actor..."'''[148] However, Kear goes on to note that without expressly stating it Hamas agreed to respect the Oslo Accords, and by extension Israel's existence: "The signing of the 2007 Mecca Agreement also meant that Hamas had met two of the three stipulations set down by Israel and the Quartet: recognising Israel and respecting all previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements."[148]

3. Graham Usher said that while Hamas did not consider Israel to be legitimate, it accepted Israel as political reality.[149] Tareq Baconi explains that Hamas' implicit recognition of Israel is in contrast to most Israeli political parties who have long opposed the idea of a Palestinian state.[150][145]

'''Option 1''': Keep all three elements as they are

'''Option 2''': Remove or alter one of the three elements, specify which exactly and how you wish to alter it (remove entirely, add something to it, etc.)

'''Option 3''': Remove or make additions to all three elements, for example, remove line 1, keep the truncated version of the Kear quote without any additional information, add year specification to Usher and remove Baconi (or if possible, include RS with alternate opinions)

For the  Talk page discussions on each of these elements see for 1: [[Talk:Hamas#Recognition_of_Israel_-_first_sentence|this link]] for 2:  [[Talk:Hamas#Recognition_of_Israel_Section_Sourcing|this link]] and [[Talk:Hamas#Recognition_of_Israel_-_removal_of_sourced_info|also this one]], for 3: [[Talk:Hamas#2006_source|this link]].

Should either of the following proposals to amend the [[WP:ITNCRIT|criteria]] for [[WP:ITN|In the news]] be adopted?

'''Proposal 1''': Amend the ITN significance criteria ([[WP:ITNSIGNIF]]) to state: The significance criteria are met if an event is reported on the print front pages of major national newspapers in multiple countries (examples of websites hosting front pages: [https://www.pressreader.com/newspapers] and [https://frontpages.freedomforum.org/gallery]).

'''Proposal 2''': Abolish ITNSIGNIF and amend the ITN update requirement ([[WP:ITNUPDATE]]) to state that a sufficient update is one that adds substantial due coverage of an event (at least two paragraphs or five sentences) to an article about a notable subject.

'''Proposal 3''': Mark [[WP:ITN]] as historical and remove the "In The News" template from the Main Page, effectively closing the process in lieu of an alternate means of featuring encyclopedic content on Wikipedia.

In my personal opinion, the lede doesn't really need to include the genocides. For example, [[Japan]]'s featured article doesn't mention the events in WW2. At least we should only say "Christian" instead of listing all the ethnic groups for the ones commited by the Ottomans. Perhaps even the ones committed to the Muslims are unnecessary. So, here are the options:

'''Option 1:''' "In the 19th and early 20th centuries, [[persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction]] and [[Persecution of Muslims#Russian Empire|in the Russian Empire]] resulted in large-scale loss of life and [[Muhacir|mass migration into modern-day Turkey]] from the [[Balkans]], [[Caucasus]], and [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]]. Under the control of the [[Three Pashas]], the Ottoman Empire [[Ottoman entry into World War I|entered World War I]] in 1914, during which the Ottoman government committed [[Late Ottoman genocides|genocides]] against its [[Armenian genocide|Armenian]], [[Greek genocide|Greek]], and [[Assyrian genocide|Assyrian]] subjects." (it will stay as it is)

'''Option 2:''' "In the 19th and early 20th centuries, [[persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction]] and [[Persecution of Muslims#Russian Empire|in the Russian Empire]] resulted in large-scale loss of life and [[Muhacir|mass migration into modern-day Turkey]] from the [[Balkans]], [[Caucasus]], and [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]]. Under the control of the [[Three Pashas]], the Ottoman Empire [[Ottoman entry into World War I|entered World War I]] in 1914, during which the Ottoman government committed [[Late Ottoman genocides|genocides]] against its [[Christianity in the Ottoman Empire|Christian]] subjects." (shortening)

'''Option 3:''' "In the 19th and early 20th centuries, [[persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction|persecution of Muslims]]  resulted in large-scale loss of life and [[Muhacir|mass migration into modern-day Turkey]]. Under the control of the [[Three Pashas]], the Ottoman Empire [[Ottoman entry into World War I|entered World War I]] in 1914, during which the Ottoman government committed [[Late Ottoman genocides|massacres]] against its [[Christianity in the Ottoman Empire|Christian]] subjects." (more shortening)

'''Option 4:''' "Under the control of the [[Three Pashas]], the Ottoman Empire [[Ottoman entry into World War I|entered World War I]] in 1914." (all the migration, massacre and genocides are removed from the article.)

'''Other:''' something else I missed.

Comments would be appreciated to achieve an accurate and supportable consensus regarding references to Storrs-Mansfield, Connecticut - an unincorporated village which is sometimes referred to as Storrs. The community is notably home to the main campus of the University of Connecticut, and, naturally reflects cultural differences both as a New England fixture but also due to some misplaced or incorrect historical usage.

The request would be to alter the lead section of the article to read as follows:

{{poem quote|text='''Storrs-Mansfield''' ({{IPAc-en|s|t|ɔːr|z| |ˈ|m|æ|n|s|f|i|l|d}} {{respell|storz| |MANS|feeld}}) is an unincorporated village and [[census-designated place]] (CDP) in the [[New England town|town]] of [[Mansfield, Connecticut|Mansfield]] in eastern [[Tolland County, Connecticut|Tolland County]], [[Connecticut]], United States. The community is part of the [[Capitol Planning Region, Connecticut|Capitol Planning Region]].

Sometimes referred to as '''Storrs''', the village is dominated economically and demographically by the main campus of the [[University of Connecticut]] and the associated [[Connecticut Repertory Theatre]].}}

Several points of discussion, including the preference and differences between census-designated place boundaries and postal town boundaries are included on the article talk page. It is not appropriate to immediately dismiss the need for a new consensus, due to the substantial official and community usage of both names.

Request for Comment: '''''Does the section on Josephology give undue weight to this article?'''''

I am seeking community input regarding the current description of the [[Josephology]] in this "Catholic theology" article. I believe that Josephology is central to Catholic theology as major doctrinal topics like [[Christology]], [[Triadology]], or [[Mariology]], which are more widely recognized as pillars of Catholic theology.

I propose that the description of Josephology should be there to ensure that the article maintains a balanced and proportionate representation of Catholic theology. [[User:Jeaucques Quœure|Jeaucques Quœure]] ([[User talk:Jeaucques Quœure|talk]]) 03:23, 12 October 2024 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Criterion #2 states that notability is satisfied if {{tq|The journal is frequently cited by other reliable sources.}}  Does this mean that papers in the journal tend to be cited frequently? Or does it mean that the journal itself must be cited frequently?  In other words, is it talking about citations that say "According to Smith (1979)..." or ones that say "According to The Journal of Underwater Basket Weaving..."? 

Just to be clear, I am asking for comment about what the current text means. I understand that there is disagreement about what it ''should'' say, but that would be a different RfC.

I found out just today that there is not an English word for this act/behavior/phenomenon, but I do not understand why the article is focused on Korea, as this type of behavior is present in multiple Asian cultures, including Chinese ([[wiktionary:撒嬌]], sajiao, or [[wiktionary:賣萌]], maimeng), Japanese ([[wiktionary:甘え]], amae), and Korea ([[wiktionary:애교]], aegyo), [[wiktionary:愛嬌]] seems to be from Japanese.

This may be a popular thing in Kpop or modern Korean culture (I am not familiar with both subjects), but I am pretty sure this type of stuff is in Asian culture before Kpop was a thing. I believe this article in the current state is in violation of [[WP:GLOBAL]] and [[WP:PROPORTION]], as it is written from a English speaking perspective (where there isn't even a word to accurately describe the subject in discussion, and hence thinking this is "a Kpop thing" due to the lack of Asian culture knowledge), and disproportionately describes the behavior in Kpop but not in the wider general Asian cultures.

As for the title, I propose using "amae", as "aegyo" seems to a word borrowed from Japanese, and this concept seems to have first been studied in the Japanese context, there is even [[The Anatomy of Dependence|a book]] on the topic.

{{rfcquote|text=
There are two common ways to link to a place name with an "A, B, C" format where the article is titled [<nowiki/>[A, B]]. Both can be read as fair interpretations of the guidance to "link only the first unit".

# Have the link span only the smallest unit, using piping if necessary
#:{{xt|[[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, United States}}
# Have the displayed text match the title of the linked article
#:{{xt|[[Buffalo, New York]], United States}}

Which style(s) is/are acceptable? If both, is one preferable to the other? 

Note: See previous discussion [[#Ambiguity in GEOLINK examples|above]] and [[#RfC: GEOLINK examples|above]]. This is <em>not</em> a question about whether "New York" should be linked to [[New York (state)]] in this example; basically everyone agrees that it should not be. 20:57, 17 October 2024 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
 Should all team nicknames be listed, instead of just the most recent?

The article states "For brevity, only the most recent names for teams that have had multiple nicknames in their current media market are  listed."  While "New Jersey Nets" and "Washington Bullets" are listed, although they have stayed in the same media market respectively, "San Francisco Warriors" is not listed as a previous name for the Golden State Warriors, who have also stayed in the same media market.  So, for the sake of completeness, should all of a team's previous names be listed?

One drawback to this option would be the number of names that would have to be listed for some teams.  For example, the Pittsburgh Steelers had multiple names during their early years, including a couple during WWII when their players combined with another team's.

{{rfcquote|text=
The maps of time zones in Wikipedia ([[:File:World Time Zones Map.svg|SVG]], [[:File:World Time Zones Map.png|PNG]]) show the time actually observed in each area, ''de facto'', regardless of legality. For example, the maps show certain parts of Australia, Canada and the United States in the time that they actually observe even though it's different from what the law specifies there. Similarly, the maps show the occupied regions of Ukraine and the separatist regions of Georgia in UTC+3, which is the time enforced by the Russian or separatist authorities there. Previous discussions about this topic resulted in keeping the map ''de facto'', including the occupied or separatist regions in UTC+3, but many users continue to complain about it, so I'm restarting the discussion here. '''How should the maps show the time zones of the occupied regions of Ukraine and separatist regions of Georgia?''' You may answer differently for each region.

Please note that the maps still show these regions as part of Ukraine and Georgia, with the international borders as generally recognized. The question here is only regarding the time zones. For reference, the IANA time zone database includes Crimea in UTC+3, but it doesn't mention the other occupied regions of Ukraine or the separatist regions of Georgia.

Are the following assertions not supported by [[WP:Reliable sources]]?

# Article asserts: {{xt|"Melas falsely claimed that Freeman made several inappropriate remarks to her."}} with no inline citation.

The cited article does not support the assertion that the allegations were proven false; it rather quotes Freeman's lawyer stating that the allegations were proven false. I haven't seen any [[WP:Reliable source]] asserting, as a matter of fact, that the allegations were proven false. I see this as an allegation and a counter-allegation, and neither has been proven. Inability to prove an allegation is not proof of falsity.

* '''Option A''' We should retain the 1998 image in the infobox as it represents Saddam at the peak of his power and global notoriety (following the Gulf War and just before the invasion of Iraq). I don't see a compelling reason to replace it, especially considering that the sole argument presented by Skornezy for changing the image is their subjective claim that [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saddam_Hussein&diff=prev&oldid=1257040499 the alternative is "objectively better"].

{{rfcquote|text=
 The Lede currently describes socdem as an ideology within socialism. 5 sources are cited for this sentence clause. Three book sources from 1999, 2005, and 2007 respectively, and two online sources from 2018 and 2019 respectively. Only 2 of them are accessible, the two online sources. Neither of the two online sources ([https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/no-left-wing-case-for-brexit/ this] and [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-does-socialism-mean-and-how-is-it-shaping-2020/ this]) make the claim that Social democracy is a movement within Socialism.

The question for the RFC is: should the lede describe the ideology as Socialist? There will be 6 options; please write the option you support along with your reasoning in the survey section, and then discuss in the discussion section. Also please write the extent to which you support the other proposals. Please don't reply to others in the survey section. Please don't just write an option without any reasoning for it.

'''Option 1:''' It should should describe it as 'a Liberal poltical ideology that supports things such as a welfare state, mixed economy, etc'.

'''Option 2:''' It should should omit the 'is a movement within' part in favour of the lede sentence, instead describing it as 'a political ideology that supports things such as a welfare state, mixed economy, etc'.

'''Option 3:''' It should describe it as a socialist political ideology, as it does now [status quo].

'''Option 4:''' It should should describe it as 'a democratic poltical ideology that supports things such as a welfare state, mixed economy, etc'

'''Option 5:''' It should should describe it as 'a capitalist poltical ideology that supports things such as a welfare state, mixed economy, etc'

'''Option 6:''' Other, it should [insert thing].

'''Option 7:''' Comment.

Should the text in bold below be kept in the introduction?

:''Hebrew, a Northwest Semitic language within the Afroasiatic language family, was spoken since antiquity and the vernacular of the Jewish people until the 3rd century BCE, when it was supplanted by Western Aramaic, a dialect of the Aramaic language''', the local or dominant languages of the regions Jews migrated to, and later Judeo-Arabic, Judaeo-Spanish, Yiddish, and other Jewish languages'''. Although Hebrew continued to be used for Jewish liturgy, poetry and literature, and written correspondence, it became extinct as a spoken language. ''

and

:''By the late 19th century, Russian-Jewish linguist Eliezer Ben-Yehuda had begun a popular movement to revive Hebrew as a living language, motivated by his desire to preserve Hebrew literature and a distinct Jewish nationality in the context of Zionism. '''Soon after, a large number of Yiddish and Judaeo-Spanish speakers were murdered in the Holocaust or fled to Israel, and many speakers of Judeo-Arabic emigrated to Israel in the Jewish exodus from the Muslim world, where many adapted to Modern Hebrew.'''''

There has been an initiative to change the interface so that the gray header at the top of the [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources#Sources|table]] "follows around" as you scroll down. See: {{t|sticky header}}. '''Which of the choices below (A-E) do you prefer?''' What other ideas do you have?

The header is now 2 lines tall. What Timeshifter is now proposing (scroll down [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources&oldid=1260153539#Sources '''this example''']) is a narrow one-line sticky header with a link from the "Status" column head back to the [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources#Legend|"Legend" section of the article]]. And a link from the "Sources" column head back to the  [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources#Sources|"Sources" section of the article]]. Notes explain this just above the table. He states this allows new users of the table to quickly return to the table TOC, or to quickly find the meaning of the legend icons. There are also improved notes above the table. 

An issue in [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-rendering|any skin other than the default Vector 2022]]: When you use the [[Template:Compact TOC|horizontal table TOC]], or if you follow ("jump to") an anchored link within the table such as [[WP:FORBESCON]], the top line of the note in the row you jump to would be covered by the narrow sticky header. 2 lines are covered by the 2-line header. [[Template talk:Sticky header|Template discussions]] have not found a way to fix this. Timeshifter does not believe this is a serious problem. Others do. One solution (see E below) is to add a line's worth of blank padding at the top of each row.

*[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources&oldid=1254288800#Forbes.com_contributors A]: No sticky header, same style (2-line) header as before. 
*[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources&oldid=1240212792#Forbes.com_contributors B]: Full size (2-line) header with sticky enabled.

To anyone unfamiliar with this, [[Wikipedia:Admin recall|admin recall]] is a new process that is exactly what it sounds like. Currently, there is a 30 day petition period: if 25 people sign it, the admin then needs to pass a new RfA within 30 days to keep the tools. Should we change the petition period?
* '''Option A:''' Keep the petition period the same (30 days) 
* '''Option B:''' Change the petition period to 7 days 
* '''Option C:''' Some other time period (like 14 or 15 days?) that's longer than a week but shorter than a month.

There has been a discussion above regarding whether more than a single image is required in the infobox. Some commenters have referred to a "longstanding consensus" against multiple images, but I see little evidence that that consensus still holds in the discussion above, other than by bold assertion. 

I invite comments regarding the number of images that should be in the infobox, from both involved an uninvolved editors.

* '''Option 0''': no image
* '''Option 1''': only one image
* '''Option 2''': two images
* '''Option 3''': three or more images

Note that this is about the ''number'' of images, not the specific images to be chosen, since the number of images seems to be the primary point of contention.

I will ping all participants in the discussion above, but please note this is an attempt to establish consensus, not to push any particular point of view, and all editors are welcome to contribute. I hold no position as to the favoured option, and thus won't express my opinion. 

Note also that this is a request for comment, not a [[WP:VOTE]]; please ''express a rationale'' for your position on this, rather than just chiming in. Non-specific references to "the archives" or that this "has been discussed many times" are not sufficient; please re-state your argument here.

{{rfcquote|text=
What flag should we use for players born in territories that are not fifa members? Currently guidance says ''regardless of nationality of birth or citizenship, or non-FIFA sporting nationalities the player may use in other contexts''. However some editors have suggested this is outdated and there should be exceptions. 

This creates a problem particularly for the Crown Dependencies as they are not members of FIFA or UEFA in their own right but part of the English FA. The Crown Dependencies are not part of England in the political sense though. In FIFA terms they are part of England however this could be considered controversial. 

There are other instances where this is the case such as players from Åland, the Isle of Wight and Anglesey all of which have football teams that appear at the island games on the same basis as the crown dependencies but in FIFA terms they are part of Finland, England and Wales respectively. Players from these territories would normally have their respective FIFA national team flag on this template.

Comments would be appreciated to achieve an accurate and supportable consensus regarding references to Storrs-Mansfield, Connecticut - an unincorporated village which is sometimes referred to as Storrs. The community is notably home to the main campus of the University of Connecticut, and, naturally reflects cultural differences both as a New England fixture but also due to some misplaced or incorrect historical usage.

The request would be to alter the lead section of the article to read as follows:

{{quote|text='''Storrs-Mansfield''' ({{IPAc-en|s|t|ɔːr|z| |ˈ|m|æ|n|s|f|i|l|d}} {{respell|storz| |MANS|feeld}}) is an unincorporated village and [[census-designated place]] (CDP) in the [[New England town|town]] of [[Mansfield, Connecticut|Mansfield]] in eastern [[Tolland County, Connecticut|Tolland County]], [[Connecticut]], United States. The community is part of the [[Capitol Planning Region, Connecticut|Capitol Planning Region]].<br><br>Sometimes referred to as '''Storrs''', the village is dominated economically and demographically by the main campus of the [[University of Connecticut]] and the associated [[Connecticut Repertory Theatre]].}}

Several points of discussion, including the preference and differences between census-designated place boundaries and postal town boundaries are included on the article talk page. It is not appropriate to immediately dismiss the need for a new consensus, due to the substantial official and community usage of both names - [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)#Alternative names|WP:NCPLACE]] and [[MOS:ALTNAME]] support this change:
{{quote|Nevertheless, other names, especially those used significantly often (say, 10% of the time or more) in the available English literature on a place, past or present, should be mentioned in the article, as encyclopedic information.}} Thank you, [[User:Jonathanhusky|Jonathanhusky]] ([[User talk:Jonathanhusky|talk]]) 19:58, 8 October 2024 (UTC)}}

There are three questions:
# Should the section on the [[Hamas#Recognition of Israel|recognition of Israel by Hamas]] discuss hypothetical recognition (whether Hamas would recognise Israel) and how prominently, based on the sources in the current version? {{Ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha
| Yes, in the first sentence as in the current version
| Yes, less prominently later in the section.
| No
}}
# Should we mention the Israeli framing of the conflict with Hamas per Kear in the recognition section? {{Ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha
| Yes (as in the current version)
| No
}}
# How should we include Usher's 2006 opinion? {{Ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha
| In the recognition section without the year (as in the current version)
| In the recognition section with the year
| In the evolution of positions section
| Nowhere in the article.
}}
This is a revised version of a [[Talk:Hamas#RFC:_Recognition_of_Israel_Section|previous RfC]].

Would it be beneficial to re-name this page to something like "Mental health of LGBTQ people"?

"Mental health of LGBTQ people" could be a more neutral way of naming this page without such unnecessary implications.

When this is resolved, please update [[WP:SDNONE]] to comply with this ruling. This RfC is necessary since there are thousands of articles where this applies where there is no consensus for use of [[WP:SDNONE]]. Additionally, the guideline is extremely short and vague for something that applies to hundreds of thousands of articles.
Potential options: 
# Yes, articles on subnational entities and municipalities in the title should have "none as a short description"
# Only for cities and subnational entities that an "average reader would know" (which I have seen brought up in the past) should have "none" as a short description (most readers know about [[Delhi]], [[Texas]], and [[Moscow]], not so much [[Kilgore, Texas]], and [[Ncojane]]) (This has been brought up in the past by Remsense)

and settled without a strong consensus.

I think we should avoid using Indian numbering conventions unless it is needed for context.  For instance, if we want to list the box office take of an Indian movie, don't use "crore", use "millions". This isn't about disrespecting a culture, it's about using internationally favored notation and unit conventions.  We should use "millions" instead of "crore" for the same reason we favor meters over feet. There is no reason that India-related articles should be an enclave of Indian conventions. People who are not Indian will struggle with these things, it will weaken Wikipedia's role as an information tool for everyone.

This is not the same thing as currency. It is appropriate to list an Indian movie's box office take in rupees.  Providing a US$ conversion is optional, but a good idea since the US dollar is widely used around the world as a reserve currency.  But write it as "millions of rupees", not "crores of rupees".

{{rfcquote|text=
Hello editors,  
I would like to discuss the inclusion of a recent controversy involving Rosalind Picard’s keynote speech at NeurIPS 2024.

Context: During the NeurIPS 2024 keynote, a slide presented by Picard included remarks that were criticized for cultural generalizations. NeurIPS issued an official statement on their verified X.com account acknowledging the issue, apologizing, and clarifying that the remarks do not align with their code of conduct. I added this incident to the article with a factual and neutral tone, citing NeurIPS' official statement as the source. However, the edit was reverted with the reasoning that more than a primary source is needed.

My Argument: While Wikipedia prefers secondary sources, the NeurIPS statement is a **reliable primary source** for verifying the occurrence of the incident. It:  
# Comes from NeurIPS’ official and verified X.com account.  
# Is a direct response to the controversy.  

Since this is a ''very recent event'', secondary sources may not yet exist. I propose the following:  
* Include a brief, factual mention of the incident, using the NeurIPS statement as a **temporary source**.  
* Commit to revising or expanding the content once independent secondary coverage emerges.  

This approach aligns with Wikipedia’s principles of **verifiability** and **neutrality** while addressing the timeliness of the incident. 

Suggested Wording: At the NeurIPS 2024 conference, Rosalind Picard’s keynote presentation included remarks that drew criticism for cultural generalizations about Chinese scholars. NeurIPS issued a statement acknowledging the remarks and clarifying that they do not align with the conference’s code of conduct.[NeurIPS official statement source here.]

I welcome input from other editors to form a consensus on this matter.

Request for Feedback: I kindly request editors' input on whether this edit can be retained temporarily with a primary source until reliable secondary sources become available.  

Notifications for Wider Participation: Related WikiProjects:
- {{Ping|WikiProject Biography}}  
- {{Ping|WikiProject Artificial Intelligence}}  

I have also notified the editors at the relevant WikiProjects to gather broader perspectives.

Pinging Involved Editors: @Hammersoft, @Isabelle_Belato: Your feedback would be greatly appreciated as this discussion develops. Thank you!

Thank you all for considering this. I look forward to working collaboratively to reach a consensus. [[User:Lancer999|Lancer999]] ([[User talk:Lancer999|talk]]) 19:11, 14 December 2024 (UTC)}}

I want to gauge consensus on whether [[List of ambassadors appointed by Donald Trump]] should be the master article for both of his terms, or whether we should have seperate articles for each term, like the one recently created.

* '''Option 1:''' '''Delete''' [[List of ambassadors appointed by Donald Trump (2025–2029)]] and use [[List of ambassadors appointed by Donald Trump]] for nominations during both terms.
* '''Option 2:''' '''Rename''' [[List of ambassadors appointed by Donald Trump]] to ''List of ambassadors appointed by Donald Trump (2017-2021)'' and keep both pages, one for each term in office.

* RFC Text:

In the wake of Donald Trump winning the 2024 presidential election, and the sheer number of RS that say that right-wing populism is the dominant faction of the Republican Party, as well as plenty of sources documenting how the Reagan-era conservative faction of the party has lost nearly all of its influence, can we move up right-wing populism to be alongside conservatism as the party's main ideology? @[[User:Toa Nidhiki05|Toa Nidhiki05]]
My personal views: I have written a lot of the section on right-wing populists in the factions section. There is too much to list here. But the key is the party's demographic base shift:
* '''Demographically,''' the Republican Party has lost its prior majority support from White voters with college degrees it had since Eisenhower and Goldwater (1950s & 1960s) to 2012. The party also has roughly 2:1 support from White voters with college degrees. Non-whites are harder to get a good read on, but in 2024 Trump won close to a majority of Hispanic voters, what appears to be a majority of Native American voters, and a significant percentage of Asian American voters. Trump won at most about 15% of African American voters.
Also I created two bar plots of the states Trump and Harris won by educational attainment. Except for New Mexico, every single state Harris won had above-average educational attainment. Trump did win four states (Utah, Pennsylvania, Kansas, and North Carolina) with above-average educational attainment, but his core strength was with below-average educational attainment states. 

It appears that the key dividing line between the two parties is education. The income divide appears to have inverted, with Harris winning a majority of voters who made over $200,000 a year. Trump won 56% of voters without a college degree, and 42% of voters with a college degree. Harris won 56% of voters with a college degree, and 42% of voters without a college degree. These are mirror images of each other. The reason Trump won is 43% of voters have college degrees, and 57% don't.

Note: I am a statistician, and this data comes from the exit polls and Census data. I don't make the data, just analyze it.

Trewartha's Book in which he defines his climate classification system clearly states marine climates in this category must be frostless. (ISBN 9780700651481 Chapter: Subtropical climates, pages 330-362). Met Office data (https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/uk-climate-averages/gbgebz4kn) shows the Isles of Scilly are not frostless. So how can the Isles of Scilly be considered "subtropical". Can anyone provide academic comment and/or third-party reliable sources that specifically claim the Isles of Scilly are subtropical?

Should we have notability standards for individual tornado articles? We already have informal inclusion criteria for "Tornadoes of YYYY" articles. Below is a preliminary proposal for such criteria, with the hope that it can evolve into a formal guideline that can possibly be referenced in future AfD discussions.

[[File:Symbol recycling vote.svg|20px|alt=recycle]] '''Previous discussions:''' [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Weather/Archive 5#New tornado articles and the news|New tornado articles and the news]], [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Weather/Archive 4#Proposal - Criteria for inclusion on Tornadoes of XXXX articles|Proposal - Criteria for inclusion on Tornadoes of XXXX articles]]

This has been nagging at me for a while now, and since another editor has talked to me about this issue, I think we bring this up. Since we have a sort of "inclusion criteria" for "Tornadoes of YYYY" articles, I suggest we come up with notability criteria for individual tornadoes as well. I'll be copy-and-pasting this from [[User:EF5/My tornado criteria]]:

This is my very primitive way of determining the notability of several tornado articles I've written, and am hoping that it could be integrated into a refined set-in-stone WPW policy that could be used in actual AfDs. I'd assume that the table will be gotten rid of and turned into a list. This has been discussed in the past, but never really came to anything. Maybe it could be... [[WP:NTORNADO]] (with it's own project page)? Starting an RfC, since obviously community input is needed. Also pinging {{ping|Departure–}}, who suggested this. :) [[User:EF5|<span style="color:#A188FC;">'''E'''</span>]]<sub>[[User talk:EF5|<span style="color:#A188FC;">'''F'''</span>]]</sub><sup>[[User:EF5/Creations|<span style="color:#A188FC;">'''5'''</span>]]</sup> 18:56, 16 December 2024 (UTC)}}

There has been some [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:7_October_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel#Events_outside_of_the_scope_of_the_article debate] between @[[User:Alaexis|Alaexis]] and myself over whether or not it is acceptable to include information in this article about events that did not happen on 7-8 October 2023. The events and text in question generally revolve around references to a summer 2024 [https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session56/a-hrc-56-26-auv.docx UN report] (note that this is a link to a .docx file which your browser may immediately download) that {{tq|deals with violations and possible crimes committed between 7 October and 31 December 2023}}. Some non-exhaustive examples of information that is being considered for removal/inclusion:

{{tq|Some of the released hostages also shared testimonies of sexual violence during their time in Gaza.[293] Israel accused international women's rights and human rights groups of downplaying the assaults.[308]}}

{{tq|Patten also reported receiving "clear and convincing information" that some of the hostages held by Hamas had suffered rape and sexualized torture and that there were "reasonable grounds" to believe such abuses were "ongoing".[316]}}

Possible options:

# Leave the article as is, containing references to the report and the information that includes references to non-7-8-October-2023-events.
# Remove this information entirely and strike any references to anything that happened before or after those two days.
# Remove information about anything that happened after 7-8 October 2023.
# Retain the content, but find reliable sources that specifically only deal with the events of 7-8 October 2023.

There are two news/articles about Assange's speech and mentioned transnational repression.

2.[https://www.rfi.fr/en/international/20241002-european-rights-body-finds-prosecution-of-wikileaks-assange-politically-motivated <nowiki>"The PACE resolution said it was 'alarmed' by reports that the CIA was covertly surveying Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and 'allegedly developing plans to poison or even assassinate him on United Kingdom soil'.[PACE] reiterates its condemnation of all forms and practices of transnational repression"</nowiki>]—— In the chapter "Transnational repression" [[Radio France Internationale]]

Should these information to be added here? Someone insists to delete these with the reason [[WP:DUE]]. But I think these should be remained for 
:1. Assange is name prominent adherent; "Jacobin" and "RFI" are mainstream media; So it is qualified for WP:DUE.
:2. The removing of these information is against [[Wikipedia:YESPOV|"does not mean the exclusion of certain points of view; rather, it means including all verifiable points of view which have sufficient due weight."]], because none point of these information will be remained.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should the article’s infobox reflect EF2/T4 or F3/T5-6? This question stems from the fact the infobox inputs can only accept a single set of values (i.e. EF2/T4 or F3/T5-6, not both). The EF2/T4 rating comes from a peer reviewed paper by [[Timothy P. Marshall]] and Stuart Robinson with the Haag Engineering Co. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327022710_Birmingham_UK_Tornado_28_July_2005 which was published] in the [[American Meteorological Society]] in August 2006. The F3/T5-6 rating comes from the [[TORRO|Tornado and Storm Research Organisation]] (TORRO), the creators of the [[TORRO scale]], T-scale, [https://www.torro.org.uk/pdf/Birmingham_Tornado_10_Year_Anniversary.pdf published in this 2015 paper].

Since the infobox can only contain one set of the ratings, this discussion more or less needs to determine which source (Haag Engineering Co. or TORRO) should be the infobox source. 
*'''Option 1''' — EF2/T4 using the Haag Engineering Co. paper.
*'''Option 2''' — F3/T5-6 using the [[TORRO]] paper.
