{{rfcquote|text=
The RfC above is poorly framed and is asking for permission to use any source on the subject even when those sources do not mention e-cigarette marketing, promotion, or advertising. If the RfC was framed differently would editors give a different response? Can we use a source to address the marketing claims when that source does not specifically state it was in relation to the marketing claims? For example, can we use a source about the safety of e-cigarettes when the source did not indicate the safety information about e-cigarettes being discussed is in relation to the marketing of e-cigarettes? Using a source to address the marketing claims is done on a case-by-case basis. '''Should we try to minimize or avoid using sources that do not indicate the content is in relation to the marketing of e-cigarettes?'''

As per the discussions above there was no consensus to use the term left-wing to far-left in the infobox. I along with other editors above advocate keeping the political position section of the infobox blank for the reasons given above. In regards to authoritarian socialism there was discussion as to whether it could be regarded as a term. This has no bearing on whether or not it should be in the political positions section of the infobox, which it shouldn't. If this fits anywhere its in the ideology section. Authoritarian socialism does not fit on the political spectrum, that's a fact, so it has no reason to be in that section of the infobox. Also none of the sources used to support the claim of the party being authoritarian socialist actually directly stated the party is authoritarian socialist, therefore breaking [[WP:SYNTHESIS]], and as such should not be included.

It's useful for an infobox to be included on this article.

The utility of including infoboxes are standard in BLPs and there's clearly enough information here for a well formatted infobox. There doesn't appear to be any compelling reason not to include one as the information provided is helpful for casual readers at a glance (especially for parameters such as date of birth which would include the subject's age which isn't currently included anywhere in the article). Also, most people probably get their answers from the infobox or the filmography rather than visiting the article to read a whole biography.

A proposed infobox (most of this information isn't included in the lead) would include name, image, date of birth, place of birth, age, residence, nationality, alma mater, occupation, years active, filmography, home town, parent and awards.

Formal editing restrictions, voluntarily accepted by an editor, have been logged on [[WP:Editing restrictions]] under the heading of ''Voluntary''. The three extant restrictions are:
# A voluntary [[WP:IBAN|interaction ban]] between two editors which is logged as "Indefinite". [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Editing_restrictions/Voluntary&oldid=799233002]
# A [[WP:TBAN|topic ban]] with a specific expiration date. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Editing_restrictions/Voluntary&diff=831905073&oldid=831904994]

Debate has arisen over whether voluntary restrictions such as these are enforceable in the same way a [[WP:CBAN|community based ban]] can be. The question of this RfC is:

I would like to draw attention to the depiction in this article of a controversy concerning an episode of this series and the response of the producers of the show. The dispute lies between two different versions of this article's description of the controversy:

# [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantico_(season_3)&diff=prev&oldid=845128122 This one], written predominantly by tendentious [[WP:SPA|single-purpose editor]] [[User:Krish!|Krish!]] (see combative edit summaries in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Krish! contribs]), which I believe violate [[WP:NPOV|Neutrality]] (value laden language like 'hateful tweets'), [[Poisoning the well]] fallacy ('criticized by Indians'), wilful disregard for content that provides valuable context (blanking of "This was dismissed as "ridiculous" and unrealistic, given .."), and numerous other unencyclopedic edits.

Clearly, this is a content dispute that's heating up rapidly, and so I have elected to take a step back and invite commentary from uninvolved objective editors so that further edits can proceed by consensus.

Should we restore the Arab/Arabic-related advice deemed correct but too narrow for the main MoS page, to this MoS subpage where it's on-topic?

Material recently reverted with "more support required", despite previous discussion of the idea meeting no opposition, on this very page:

{{block indent|1=
{{fake heading|level=3|Easily confusable terms}} 
{{shortcut|MOS:CONFUSE|MOS:ARAB}}
Do not use similar or related words in an incorrect, distorting, or meaning-blurring way.  For example, the adjective ''Arab'' refers to people and things of ethnic Arab origin. The term ''Arabic'' refers to the Arabic language or writing system, and related concepts. ''Arabian'' relates to the Arabian peninsula or historical Arabia. (These terms are all [[Proper noun|capitalized]], e.g. {{xt|Arabic coffee}} and {{xt|Arabian stallion}}, aside from a few conventionalized exceptions that have lost their cultural connection, such as {{xt|gum arabic}}.)  Do not substitute these terms for ''Islamic'', ''Moslem'', ''Islamist'', ''Middle-eastern'', etc.; a Moslem Arab is someone who is in both categories. Similar concerns pertain to many cultural, scientific, and other topics and the terminology used about them.  When in doubt about terminology, consult major modern dictionaries.

The 12th PM's govt was dissolved and later reinstated so the number for both terms before dissolution and after restoration should be 12. Now the 11th PM was Benazir Bhutto and she was re-elected in new elections and new voting after 12th PM resigned so she should be the 13th PM. She was not reinstated like 12th PM so the number should not be same for her 2nd term. Now after that 12th PM was re-elected in new elections but his number is still 12 like he's reinstated like before. Isn't this messed up? There's a difference between restoration and re-election. When a PM is restored he is restored to same old office but when he is re-elected it's new election, new voting, new oath and so new number as well. These numbers would probably be okay if these were consecutive terms like Obama was re-elected. There can’t be same number for non-consecutive terms. I've tried to change this but my edits are removed and asked to discuss about it. And another thing is we can't find any source which is focused on numbering. Some newspapers have used Wikipedia's numbering but it can't be used as source here as they are using Wikipedia as source. And this is a common sense thing so I think users should make a decision on this because there are many attempts to change it and many questions/discussion regarding the numbers on PM's talk pages. There’s no need to repeat numbers. If you see official government website for Prime Minsters of Pakistan you’ll see they don’t use same number they even changed number for reinstated term. So current numbering doesn’t make sense at all. It’s just confusing for everyone. Please end this dispute. There’s no reason for using current numbering.

{{ping|Jibran1998|Kashmiri|Vif12vf}} Shouldn't be changed?

No, Because number of Prime Minister is for the person. Express Tribune, Geo are reputable News Agencies you cant just ignore their News.

{{rfcquote|text=
In this article, a limited number (about half a dozen) of users are contributing recently, plus one who is only deleting.

The point of argument is the origin or national identity of Souliotes. Some users want to emphasize on sources which claim Albanian origin or identity (language etc), and others want to emphasize the local origin and Greek identity. 

The subject (Souliotes) has a peculiarity: Their traditional community and way of living disappeared around 1830's, and there are very few sources who had a real contact with them. The rest (especially sources of the 20th c.) are interpretations of the previous, and some are heavily biased by the late 20th c.  ethnic conflicts in the Balkans.

There is a section covering the 19th century sources in the article. Some (but not all) are already there, but there are more that qualify for this section. These old sources are just mentioned, with no comments. Two or three users are strongly opposing to a couple of these sources. Latest unwanted source, the Austrian Military Gazette of 1830. Another one is not even primary: William Leake [https://books.google.gr/books?id=9XUKAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=el&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=snippet&q=of%20Mount%20Pindus&f=false Leake W. "Travels in Northern Greece", London, 1835, vol. 1, p. 502]. The "problem" with those sources, as I understand it, is that they refer to Souliotes as Greeks and of local (rather than Albanian) origin. 

My argument is this: a) WP does not exclude the older sources from the articles, and gives certain guidelines on how to use them. b) There are already some early 19th century sources in the article. Therefore, if we are to exclude some, we must agree on the process of exclusion.

I would like to draw attention to the depiction in this article of a controversy concerning an episode of this series and the response of the producers of the show. The dispute lies between two different versions of this article's description of the controversy:
# [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantico_(season_3)&diff=845105676&oldid=845105518 This one], edited predominantly by myself, which I believe is neutral, concise, and adheres to wikipedia policies concerning [[WP:NPOV|Neutrality]],[[WP:N|Notability]],[[WP:RS|Reliability]] and [[WP:UNDUE|Due Weight]].
# [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantico_(season_3)&diff=prev&oldid=845128122 This one], written predominantly by tendentious [[WP:SPA|single-purpose editor]] [[User:Krish!|Krish!]] (see combative edit summaries in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Krish! contribs]), which I believe violate [[WP:NPOV|Neutrality]] (value laden language like 'hateful tweets'), [[Poisoning the well]] fallacy ('criticized by Indians'), wilful disregard for content that provides valuable context (blanking of "This was dismissed as "ridiculous" and unrealistic, given .."), and numerous other unencyclopedic edits.

Clearly, this is a content dispute that's heating up rapidly, and so I have elected to take a step back and invite commentary from uninvolved objective editors so that further edits can proceed by consensus.

Should this category be including individual people who are identified, by themselves or others, as "liberals"? The issue in this instance is that the selection of people so categorized here is incredibly random, partial and highly non-representative: the ''entirety'' of its selection of people consists of Barbara Boxer, Sheryl Crow, Whoopi Goldberg, Kamala Harris, Truc Ho, Hubert Humphrey, Cynthia Nixon, Walter Reuther, Susan Sarandon, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Barbara Streisand and Elizabeth Warren. Namely, four prominent politicians, a political activist, a writer, five people who are politically irrelevant entertainment industry figures, and one entertainment figure who is technically also a political candidate but is not notable for that per se, but ''not'' the hundreds or thousands of other notable people (Biden? Clooney? Gillibrand? Franken? Obama? The Clintons?) who would also belong here if people were fair game. I distinctly recall that there ''was'' a past consensus against categorizing non-political figures by ideology, and restricting categorization even of political figures to their ''political party'' rather than trying to assign them to liberalism or conservatism in general — but I don't know if that's since been deprecated, or if some editors have just been ignoring it and need a tap on the nose.

While fighting off mass waves of ip/new account vandalism on articles related to the world cup and the NBA drafts, I thought about how it would be easier if I could protect the pages instantly, instead of having to go to [[WP:RPP]], one of the most notoriously backlogged pages on the site. I believe that trusted users should be able to request a user right that would let them '''Semi-protect pages for a finite amount of time (a few months, 6 maybe, at most)'''. This right would have to be requested for and granted, and can be removed like any other right. Having this would massively benefit those more active in anti-vandalism work (like me), and would overall decrease the amount of vandalism/spam on the site by a large amount. I know the primary concern will be weather or not this right will be abused if edit wars happen with unregistered/new accounts, but the request process for the right should be able to filter out those who would abuse it in that way.[[User:Money emoji |<span style="text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml"><b style="color:#060">💵Money💵emoji💵</b></span>]]<sup>[[User talk:Money emoji|💸]]</sup> 17:09, 3 July 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Greetings, all. The article contains the historical context of the June 2018 referendum in Switzerland about "sovereign money," context found in the two sections titled "Background" and "Origin and proposal." There are objections to the material being in the article based on various arguments, such as that it relies too much or even entirely on primary sources, it's irrelevant, it gives undue weight to fringe viewpoints, and perhaps includes original research. There are also objections on the basis of the unreliability of the sources used. On the other hand, there are those who support the inclusion of historical context, and focus the argument on the legitimacy of the sources used. 

Let's begin the process with the section titled "[[Swiss_sovereign_money_referendum,_2018#Background|Background]]". Evidently, the referendum was not born suddenly and out of nowhere; the notions behind it (opposition to [[Fractional-reserve banking|fractional banking]], etc) have been around for a very long time. For instance, there exists information currently in that section about
::The [[Austrian economics|Austrians]]' objections to fractional banking
::The 1933 [[Chicago plan]] to do away with fractional banking criticism of fractional banking
::The introduction in the US Congress of a [[NEED Act|bill]] that included the same measures proposed in the referendum  
::The 2015 report by a gov't-appointed committee in [[Iceland]] that recommended measures similar to the referendum's
::And the basic notions behind the Swiss proposal as put forward by its initiators and ideologues, using sources and direct citations from their work.

What need to be expanded is the "Parliamentary and political record" part.  Presently we have a lot about what other people says about her....little about what she says herself!

::What is wikipedia current policy? power~enwiki? I am thinking of inclusiveness as one of them. Why shouldn't it be a current policy here? It is not consensus that should rule, that is too simplistic. Inclusiveness should also be considered for fuller coverage. It almost sounds like including third or independent parties as something that shouldn't happen? This, as an encyclopedia, should have all of the situation of the elections in Ohio. I have noticed some who have colluded to purposely deny ANY third party access on other Wiki pages. If you look you will find it. It is happening as we speak. To me it is deeply disturbing and should be to every wikipedian. bradv quoted me that wikipedia is not a democracy but I keep getting quoted info about polls as a basis for publishing. Democracy as in hearing people out is what's important. Publish the facts. So and so is running. Good! There are 5 candidates in Ohio. With only two pictures of them seems as though someone is playing favorites. Not a Democracy?, then no polls should be cited as an inclusive principle. Either way the poll argument is a fail, in that full information on THE candidates is not available. Dael4 (talk) 04:05, 28 July 2018 (UTC)}}

The issue of the use of [[chain (unit)|chains]] has again reared its head. It is now time to put this to bed by having a discussion and reaching consensus on the use of chains in railway articles.

;Articles likely affected:
Articles on railway stations and railway lines in the British Isles.

;Articles possibly affected
Artcles on railway stations and railway lines where the British had strong influence in their construction. Basically the British Empire and other areas, such as Argentina.

;The dispute
Some editors claim that the use of chains should be deprecated as they are a generally archaic measurement. Other editors claim that the use of chains is appropriate as long as external sources use chains, and that chains are a unit of measurement still used by the modern railway in the United Kingdom today.

;Previous discussions
*[[Talk:Darlington railway station#Distance from London]] (January 2018)
*[[Talk:East Croydon station#Chains]] (July 2018)

;Policies affecting this dispute
*[[WP:V]]

;Guidelines affecting this dispute

*[[WP:JARGON]]

;Enforcement proceedures affecting this dispute

[Please excuse the length ... the topic is complicated] This post concerns the lede sentence:

"To demonstrate that you are not adding OR, you must be able to cite reliable, published sources that are directly related to the topic of the article, and directly support the material being presented."

It arose in Gaza beach explosion (2006) - Talk - section "3. Article Improvement Discussions", with discussions regarding the addressing of events in Gaza prior to beach explosions which all but wiped out an extended Palestinian family and sent shockwaves through the media. As with many of the Israel-Palestine conflicts (perhaps even 'all') the climax event, from which the name of the article is usually derived, hardly ever occurs randomly out of the blue with no prior build-up. Israel does not invade Gaza without militants from the Strip first having fired rockets at the southern Negev. Militants rarely do that out of pure spite, but because Israel has done something to prejudice their lives, like the assassination of a senior official, a crippling blockade, the killing of civilians near the border zone, etc. And those in turn have their antecedents also; the murder of teenagers, etc. This is not a new issue, and one related question goes - "How far back does one go? To the apple in the garden?" A few years ago KingsIndian (talk · contribs), fully aware of this issue, made what was accepted at the time as a very reasonable suggestion. Why not go back to a level playing field when all parties agreed to a cessation of hostilities, or to some informal but significant period of mutual calm - what I think he called a "blank slate". In that way we can avoid having an article "XXX event" and a separate article "Origin of the XXX Event" by including the prequel development of tensions between a cessation of hostilities (e.g. as a result of the ceasefire/truce) and the next bellicose flurry.

The above applies to less than epic "events". The prelude to the Six Day War for instance, would be as long as the rest of the article, which would be cumbersome. A brief flurry of a few days or even weeks might warrant having the prelude included in the main article. [I have no idea how one reasonably chooses how to make that split - a future topic]

So to get to the essence: Many events in the prelude of, say, the Gaza War (2008–09), have sources which never contemplated the future climactic war - Operation Cast Lead (OCL). The source on Arafat's death, that for the details of the understanding of the June 2008 ceasefire terms; the breaking of the ceasefire on 4 November 2008; the subsequent hail of rockets on Israel, many of the authors of the provided sources had no idea that OCL was soon to take place. To apply the WP:OR policy that sources must be directly related to the topic (the 2008/09 war - OCL) therefore usually requires some degree of subjective interpretation ... dangerous!! Yet a sequence of reliable sources may show that one individual event triggered the next. HOWEVER, there are VERY few quality sources that stitch all of these events together, and even more rarely, do so in Wiki-acceptable detail. Alternatively there are almost no sources that deny causal chains. Instead, one may appeal to "the sky is blue" principle that if A led to B, and B led to C, then A and C are part of the same sequence or chain. Sadly this process is usually interrupted by lengthy edit wars.

My proposal is that in the seemingly never-ending series of bellicose events, the preludes - the history of tension building - is encylopedically relevant to the climactic straw, and should be welcomed. But were sources to be disallowed that did not directly link the individual events in the chain to the breaking of the camel's back, (according to the Wiki condition quoted at the start), then this valuable chain of causative information would be excluded from Wiki. I am too much of a n000b to dredge Wiki protocol for a solution, so I look to more experienced peers. Maybe the solution is as simple as changing the article name from "Gaza beach explosion (2006)" to "Gaza beach explosion (2006) and its origin".

{{rfcquote|text=
The "In wrestling" section has been a standard part of professional wrestling biographies for over a decade. It covers mostly character information in a bulleted list format. On May 24, 2018, an editor raised an issue with the section's vague heading to [[WP:PW|WikiProject Professional wrestling]] (see [[WT:PW#In wrestling]]). The next day, renaming the heading to "Professional wrestling highlights" and adjusting "Championships and accomplishments" into a subsection beneath it was proposed. On June 3, it was considered to have reached consensus after the 5 participants agreed unanimously. In the weeks that followed, a few editors disapproved of the new heading, as well as "Championships and accomplishments" being turned into a subsection. On June 24, clarification of which heading to go forward with was requested, where an additional option to remove the section entirely was proposed. On June 28, the discussion was closed after 10 editors participated, with an "overwhelming consensus" to remove the section but rework any content deemed significant into prose, potentially into a "Professional wrestling persona" section (see [[WT:PW#Trying to gain clarity (closed)]]). The changes were immediately enacted into hundreds of articles, causing news of the changes to be spread onto online professional wrestling communities. Many new editors voiced frustration over the removal, with some reverting the changes.

Below is the style recommendations for this section, taken from WikiProject Professional wrestling [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Professional_wrestling/Style_guide&oldid=847654515 prior to its removal]:
{{Collapse top|"In wrestling" recommendations per WP:PW/SG}}
An overview of notable character information is compiled in a [[WP:BULLET|bulleted list format]]. This initial section should be limited to '''finishing moves''', '''signature moves''', '''managers''' (and/or '''wrestlers managed'''), '''nicknames''', '''entrance themes''', and '''wrestlers trained'''. Any taunts, gestures, or other descriptions are better suited for the article prose.

{{Collapse top|Example of highlights list}}
* '''Finishing moves'''
** [[Moonsault]]
** ''Western Lariat'' ([[Professional wrestling attacks#Lariat|Lariat]])
* '''Signature moves'''
** [[Dropkick]], sometimes from the [[Missile dropkick|top rope]]

{{Collapse bottom}}

* All items should be sorted alphabetically. An exception is with entrance themes, which can be sorted chronologically if date ranges are sourced.
* For signature and finishing moves, there must be one reliable source explicitly mentioning that it is a signature move of the wrestler. One reliable source merely mentioning that the wrestler ''performed'' the move is not enough.
* A specially named move should be italicized, with the regular name following in parentheses and wiki-linked.
* {{tl|Cite episode}} should not be used for citing moves as commentators often call moves wrong or do not give full technical names, leading to speculation.
* Track names in entrance themes should not be wiki-linked to articles about the compilation albums on which they are sold, unless the article contains further information on the track itself (not just name, number, and wrestler who used it).
{{Collapse bottom}}

This proposal seeks to remove the "In wrestling" section, with the possibility of any of its content that is deemed significant to be contextualized in prose. Much of the information contained within this section would be lost. The content most likely to be reworked is certain Finishing moves, Nicknames and Wrestlers trained. As it stands, Managers are already expected to be covered in prose, primarily in the "Professional wrestling career" section. If necessary, reworked content can be placed within the existing "Professional wrestling persona" section (see [[WP:PW/SG#Professional wrestling persona]]).

Below are diffs from various articles, showing before the section's removal, after the removal, and some with content reworked to prose:

Should the section Immigration be removed from this BLP ?

The section was criticized as trivial in amount or portion of his positions, and just not biographically significant. 
It was a single line: Hannity opposed amnesty, then he favored a "path to citizenship" before he opposed that idea.[7] 

Since then the line has been been stated a bit more verbosely, and then another remark added: Hannity opposed amnesty, then he said in 2012 that he had evolved on the issue and favored a "pathway to citizenship".[118][7] Later, he opposed that idea.[7] By 2018, he was described as an "immigration hardliner".[119][120][121]

This is continuing discussions elsewhere, such as [[Wikipedia talk:Automated taxobox system#Reverting to 'manual' Taxoboxes]].  Sorry if I'm not posting this correctly, I just want to get this discussion started.

It seems there has not been a good clear discussion in the ToL and its related projects on the adoption of [[Wikipedia:Automated taxobox system]] over 'manual' taxoboxes like {{tl|taxobox}}.  Not all taxa can be converted to automatic (there isn't an automatic version of {{tl|Paraphyletic group}}, for example, and viruses need a new box too).  However, the overwhelming majority can use the automated taxobox system.

{{rfcquote|text=
As {{ping|Peter coxhead}} noted [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Viruses#Automated taxobox system and viruses|above]], we need more voices here.  

Viruses are sadly not compatible with the automated taxobox system involving {{tl|Automatic taxobox}}, {{tl|Speciesbox}}, and so forth.  In addition, the old 'manual' system involves taxonomy predating the current [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICTV]] system, especially with regards to formatting (italics, etc.).  The taxonomy template hierarchy is compatible with viruses and other non-cellular life.  

# Should effort be made to create a virusbox template compatible with the automated taxobox system?
# What should the specifications of the new template be, if made?
# Should [[viroid]]s, [[prion]]s, [[Satellite (biology)|satellites]] and other virus-dependent nucleic acids be included in the same template, as they are [https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_9th_report/sub-viral-agents-2011/w/sub_viruses addressed by ICTV], even if [https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_9th_report/sub-viral-agents-2011/w/sub_viruses/165/1-fungal-prions the formal taxonomy of viruses does not extend to unconventional agents like prions and prion “species” are not included in the ICTV Master Species List]?

Shahanshah ({{literal translation|the king of kings}}) is a title that some [[List of monarchs of Persia|Shahs (kings) of Iran]] used and some did not.  
The question is:
#Should the articles about rulers of Iran, cite a source stating that certain ''shah'' did use the title ''shahanshah'' or it is OK to use it without a source? 
#Should the title ''Shahanshah'' be used for {{para|succession}} in the infobox, or {{para|title}} will suffice?
You can see the discussion above over the dispute.

The lead says, "Military occupation is distinguished from annexation by its intended temporary nature (i.e. no claim for permanent sovereignty), by its military nature, and by citizenship rights of the controlling power not being conferred upon the subjugated population." East Jerusalem was annexed by Israel. Available sources on the subject show that the majority of all international bodies and the majority of all international actors view this annexation as Illegal and further view that East Jerusalem is under Military occupation. For the sake of consistency with the Lead do we remove the listing for East Jerusalem?

Israel disengaged from the land of Gaza in 2005. Israel no long views Gaza being under Military occupation them. Their control of the borders, sea, and air of Gaza the sources show is the reason the international community views Gaza to still be under Military occupation. The Sources show that the majority of all international actors and the majority of all international bodies consider Gaza to still be under Military occupation.

Both {{u|Master-Of-America}} and an anonymous editor (who I assume are the same human being) introduce Chang’s nationality as “Chinese” and change his birthplace from “Taipei, Taiwan” to “Taipei, Taiwan, China” or “Taiwan, China” in this article of a BLP. Multiple editors have challenged this editor’s additions, two of whom (including myself) have explained why they disagree with them. “Chinese” is intended to be used to refer to persons who were born in mainland China and carry a Chinese passport (ex. [[Xi Jinping]]) as opposed to “Taiwanese” for persons born in the Republic of China ([[Tsai Ing-wen]]). In addition, “Taipei, Taiwan” is the most neutral and almost exclusively used term for Taipei; “Taipei, Taiwan, China”, I strongly feel ,goes against [[WP:POVNAMING]]. Sadly, this human instead chooses to engage in personal attacks, and since they are clearly not interested in engaging in constructive conversation to reach a consensus, I am starting this RfC to try to settle this matter.

Just scrolling through here, I noticed that there was a debate a few months ago about whether the phrase "far right" could be used in the intro to describe InfoWars like so:

:InfoWars (stylized as INFOWARS) is a '''far right''' American conspiracy theorist and fake news website and media platform owned by Alex Jones's Free Speech Systems LLC.

based on the [[WP:RS|WP:RSes]]:

* https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/infowars-leading-brands-youtube-pull-alex-jones-a8239371.html

* https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/13/alex-jones-sued-charlottesville-claims-459244

It seemed like most editors in that discussion agreed with the descriptor, but because of historical objection decided to hold off until it could be properly decided by an Rfc. Then no one started an Rfc. I hate unfinished things, so here.

Should the first sentence of this article describe InfoWars as "far right"?

We keep having discussions on this that peter out without reaching a clear consensus, so it is my hope that a formal RFC will bring in a broader set of editors and improve the state of affairs.

Historically this artwork has been credited as being by Marcel Duchamp. But, it was originally signed under a pseudonym and in the 1980s a letter was discovered in which Duchamp credited an unnamed female friend for the work. Many recent sources, including both popular press, academic journal articles, and the Tate Museum (see discussion), have felt it necessary to at least mention this issue. Several of these sources outline alternative theories for its authorship and the identity of this friend, including Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, Louise Norton, or a female alter ego of Duchamp himself. Our article, too, describes these alternative theories in its body, but the lead (which by [[MOS:LEAD]] should accurately summarize the body) instead flatly says "produced by Marcel Duchamp") and the lead image (redundantly) also says "by Marcel Duchamp" without qualification. We have had multiple past discussions on this issue but they have tended to peter out inconclusively, and then their lack of conclusion has been used repeatedly by editors {{u|Coldcreation}} and {{u|Modernist}} as a reason for keeping the status quo, with any changes to the lead being reverted with edit summaries like "needs to be settled at talk page" or "per talk". In the meantime, another editor {{u|Trishcan}} has entered the debate with an [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fountain_(Duchamp)&oldid=850592822 alternative lead] that in my mind goes too far in another direction, going into excessive detail in the lead about the authorship question and choosing sides in favor of Elsa.

So, can we have a wider discussion, please, on the following five questions:
#Should the alternative authorship theories be described in the body of the article, as they now are?
#Should the lead summarize that part of the article?
#Should the authorship of the artwork be mentioned at all in the caption of the lead image?
#If the answers to parts (1) and (2) are yes, is the proposed summary in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fountain_(Duchamp)&oldid=848582678 this old version of the lead] accurate or, if not, what changes are needed to make it conform to [[MOS:LEAD]]?
#Alternatively, is Trishcan's lead, crediting EvFL rather than Duchamp, a better starting point for a new lead?
We have also had discussions here about whether "(Duchamp)" is an accurate disambiguator for the article title but I would prefer to keep that out of the RFC for now.
For the record, my own answers to these questions are (1) yes, with no additional changes needed; (2) yes, (3) no, (4) yes, (5) no. (In more detail re 4 vs 5: We should teach the controversy rather than picking sides, per [[WP:NPOV]]. And I don't think it is currently the consensus of art scholarship that EvFL created it. Rather, there are still many scholars who hold to the Duchamp theory, and others who would more likely say that it's unclear rather than picking any alternative theory. So until such a consensus is formed I think saying so here is premature.) —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 21:41, 16 July 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
At the present time [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tham_Luang_cave_rescue&oldid=852432173] we have a subsection consisting of two lengthy paragraphs, titled "Elon Musk," describing his work on a child-sized submarine to rescue the boys and how it was not used. There is also a description of the controversy it engendered, which included a war of words between Musk and one of the rescuers that raises BLP issues. Currently the amount of space devoted to the Musk controversy is significantly longer than the "Recovery" subsection devoted to the actual removal of the boys from the cave. The question is how much space should be devoted to this matter. I think reasonable choices are.

#''' The current amount of space.'''
#'''Far less space, just a few sentences, and no subsection.'''
#'''More space'''
#'''Other'''

{{rfcquote|text=
As seen above at [[Talk:Trypophobia#Latest changes]], there is disagreement on whether or not we should limit text to a source's exact words. In this regard, the question of whether it's [[WP:Original research]] to use our own wording as opposed to a source's exact words, and whether summarizing/paraphrasing material by using the word "some" needs to be tagged as [[WP:Weasel]], has come up. The disagreement additionally concerns extensively quoting from a source, free or not, and [[WP:YESPOV|stating things in Wikipedia's voice]] when sources disagree, the research is new, and/or there is no consensus in the literature on the matter.

Should we only use a source's exact wording? Is it WP:Original research to summarize/paraphrase a source without using the source's exact words? Should we quote extensively from a source, whether it's free or not? [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 19:16, 20 July 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
As seen in [[Talk:Domestic violence#NPOV discussion on Domestic violence#Gender differences|a section]] above this one, one view is that the article lends [[WP:Undue weight|undue weight]] to women as victims and/or their use of [[self-defense]] as a reason for domestic violence. This view argues that the prevalence of violence perpetrated by women is downplayed, and that quality sources support this. This view says that there should be more in the article about domestic violence against men and certain related debates. The other view is that the article reflects the general literature on this matter and is therefore WP:Due weight. The literature on domestic violence/[[intimate partner violence]] focuses significantly more on women than it does on men and states that domestic violence disproportionately affects women or that domestic violence victims are overwhelmingly women and that they suffer more severe consequences. It also significantly highlights self-defense as the main, or one of the main, reasons that women engage in domestic violence/intimate partner violence. Quality sources support this. Not every debate should be be included or get as much weight.  

So, for this RfC, the question is...does the article lend undue weight to women as victims and/or their use of self-defense as a reason for domestic violence? I'll alert [[WP:Women]], [[WP:Men]], [[WP:Sociology]] and [[WP:Med]] to this RfC. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 11:45, 21 July 2018 (UTC)}}

I made a proposal to edit the lead of the "Millennials" article from saying, "There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years", to "There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s to the mid 1990s as the cohort's birth years, with some extending the end of the cohort up to the early 2000s." Recently there has been new research regarding millennial end dates. Obviously this is not an exact science, but I feel that we need to constantly update the page with the most current consensus and new findings. We are currently having a discussion at the bottom of this talk page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Millennials. Please carefully read the discussion before commenting. Another request I have is to only include reliable, well researched sources from reputable people or organizations, and to cut down [[WP:UNDUE]] sources. However editor DynaGirl is claiming that these undue sources are from notable researchers and demographers and that “they have stood the test of time.” She is yet to give proper evidence to back up her claims besides restating the same things she has already said multiple times on different discussions. -[[User:Akhila3151996|Akhila3151996]] ([[User talk:Akhila3151996|talk]]) 07:08, 24 July 2018 (UTC)}}

Please note that per [[WP:NOTDIRECTORY]], Wikipedia does '''not''' use lists to create comprehensive [[WP:PRIMARYSOURCES|primary-sourced]] directories of "every non-notable thing in this class that happens to exist in the world" — Wikipedia lists (especially if they have open-ended inclusion criteria that invite hundreds or thousands of entries instead of a small defined number) are not free-for-all "web directories" of everything that ''exists'', but are finding aids for ''Wikipedia'' content. So the ''only'' appropriate entry on this list is the one that '''has a Wikipedia article to link to''', and padding the list out with non-notables, sourced only to their own [[WP:SELFPUB|self-published]] websites or the CHFC's directory of its member co-ops, is ''not'' an acceptable detour ''around'' the fact that there's no substantive reason to keep a list of just one thing. This was clearly an attempt to undercut an AFD discussion by turning the list into something Wikipedia lists are not supposed to be, and it is not acceptable.

 What is wikipedia current policy? [[User:power~enwiki|power~enwiki]]? I am thinking of inclusiveness as one of them. Why shouldn't it be a current policy here? It is not consensus that should rule, that is too simplistic. Inclusiveness should also be considered for fuller coverage. It almost sounds like including third or independent parties as something that shouldn't happen? This, as an encyclopedia, should have all of the situation of the elections in Ohio. I have noticed some who have colluded to purposely deny ANY third party access on other Wiki pages. If you look you will find it. It is happening as we speak.  To me it is deeply disturbing and should be to every wikipedian. [[User:bradv|bradv]] quoted me that wikipedia is not a democracy but I keep getting quoted info about polls as a basis for publishing. Democracy as in hearing people out is what's important. Publish the facts. So and so is running. Good! There are 5 candidates in Ohio. With only two pictures of them seems as though someone is playing favorites. Not a Democracy?, then no polls should be cited as an inclusive principle. Either way the poll argument is a fail, in that full information on THE candidates is not available. [[User:Dael4|Dael4]] ([[User talk:Dael4|talk]]) 04:05, 28 July 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
  Currently this page attempts to differentiate 'legacy' and 'modern' chips. Can we instead combine the section to focus on as list of functions in the 7400s? First, this creates an arbitrary line between of the age of a part and does not denote whether the part is in production. Second, the 7400 is a 2-input NAND gate where all subsequent families used a 74xx00 as a the NAND function in the family. This would remove the need for the 1G-3G tables since 1G-3G parts are their are device families; this is because the LVC1G and the LVC device families are different technologies and can be seen in the voltage ranges of the devices.

The nationality section in the article clearly provides reliable sources confirming the nationality of this person is disputed. Reliable Encyclopedias state he was a German in his identification.

The official color and ratio of the [[Flag of NATO]] is [[Pantone]] 280 and 3:4.

Use of flag is rare in NATO documents because of a recommendation to use logos instead, and the proper flag doesn't appear in any recent document either.

The article currently quotes NPR as saying that Prager "targets multiculturalism, Muslims, and LGBTQ people." The NPR article in question also provides evidence for this claim. I have suggested that this evidence should be included in the piece to make it more informative what the NPR report is getting at. [[User:Ronz|Ronz]] disagrees, and apparently takes the view that while the assertion about Prager targeting these things is of encyclopedic value, the evidence for this claim about targeting is not of encyclopedic value. Ronz also believes that I should not pursue this matter further, as I am a new user. Perhaps he is right, and I apologize if I'm in violation of some policy. But, since I felt I had made a reasonable suggestion in good faith, I was hoping to get some more people to give a perspective on this matter.[[User:Shinealittlelight|Shinealittlelight]] ([[User talk:Shinealittlelight|talk]]) 01:00, 21 August 2018 (UTC)}}

Consider the European Left Party a far left group or the European Green Party a Left wing group and then consider the European People´s Party a centre-right one and ALDE a centre one is politically motivated. Almost all member parties in ALDE are centre-right, sometimes even more in the right than the EPP national counterpart. In the same way, consider the EPP just centre-right is not correct, there ir a more centre-right wing and a more right-wing one inside the party. EPP leaders of Slovenia, Bavaria, Hungary, Spain, France or Austria nowdays are clearly not centre-right.

Let´s be objective about this and don´t try to manipulate. Consider liberalism centre tries to demonize ideologies and parties coming from socialism. A true centrist party would be the one compromising socialism and liberalism, a liberal socialism as would say Norberto Bobbio. The PES and the EPP were centre- right and centre-left in the past because of social-democracy and christian-democracy builduing european welfare state system. since times have changed, new parties have arise, as well as new sociologial times, this has changed a bit, but the idea is the same. Classical liberalism or even neoliberalism is not the centre, because it is not a compromise of liberal socialism, it is a centre-right option that understands freedom only on its negative-freedom approach. In the same way, the more conservative, nationalistic, right-wing posittions of many EPP members cannot be avoided. --[[Special:Contributions/213.254.88.156|213.254.88.156]] ([[User talk:213.254.88.156|talk]]) 11:20, 31 July 2018 (UTC)}}

Opinions are requested as to whether the numeric colour values (RGB, HSV and Hexadecimal) in the various tables in this article are appropriate? Is this excessively detailed overcoverage? If such values are deemed potentially appropriate, further opinions are requested as to how they can be validly referenced to provide [[WP:V|verifiability]]. It has become clear (from discussion above) that these values were derived from colour swatches and sampled from websites in what I believe to be an act of [[WP:OR|original research]]. I believe the values to be unverified and also intrinsically unverifiable. As a glance at the discussion above will reveal, this is very strongly disputed with no consensus as the correct way to apply the policies, so opinions on this are requested. I have removed the value columns once and have been reverted. Ultimately, '''I would like to know whether to remove them again?'''

The past few days or weeks the previous government type description was shortened to just "Federal republic". This technically is correct but is definitely too simplistic and below the standards of the average Wikipedia article on a country. Just look at any article on a country and the government description is similar to the one I'm proposing we return to.

There was a tag on this page and [[Baconian method]] to merge this one into that one place in August 2018. I saw an old discussion with no real comment but saw the tag was recent so I went and did it. Hasty sure but bold and it seemed obvious to me that it should be done as the Baconian method is not so much a topic unto itself as one of many things covered in Novum Organum. My work was revert due to no discussion or consensus despite the similarity of the topic. The reverting editor had good point though, Novum Organum ought to be the page that remains if a merger is to occur. So I figured flipping the merger proposal and tagging an RfC would be a good way to drum up some conversation.

Obviously I support a merger since I went ahead and did the work, which can be seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baconian_method&oldid=853888843 here]. Although I definitely didn't finish. Also, the new merge would clearly be different then what I did given they would be going together in the opposite direction. I contend that it's basically the same content but on the Baconian method page there is less of it and also some irrelevant stuff.

What do we think would work? I consensus is leave the separate I'll work on a separate improvement of Baconian method or just move on to another project but I'd like to merge them. [[User:Rap Chart Mike|Rap Chart Mike]] ([[User talk:Rap Chart Mike|talk]]) 19:04, 9 August 2018 (UTC)}}

I searched the archives of both here and [[WP:VPP]] and couldn't find much, so I apologise if this has been discussed recently. From what I can tell, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_policy&diff=next&oldid=109283992 this] is the beginning of WP:ATD in its present form, and it has remained largely the same ever since, albeit with a few additions and amendments over the years. I don't know if it had consensus, and I see no point in trying to find out, because it won't change anything even if there was consensus: it's the consensus of today that matters, not the consensus of 11 years ago. And I'm not entirely convinced that the community actually agrees with its status as policy: there are many, many cases of what would appear to be [[WP:IGNORINGATD]] cases (which I actually find a bit strange as I was under the impression that [[WP:ATA]] is a widely accepted essay on deletion?).

*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cad-Capture Group]] - Client of a notable organisation, yet no-one even considered [[WP:ATD-M]] or [[WP:ATD-R]].
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Vergenoegd Primary School]] - A redirect per [[WP:ATD-R]] would still have fixed the problem.
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tuncay Öztürk]] - This was speedied as G7, but that aside, [[WP:ATD-M]] or [[WP:ATD-R]] were likely still applicable (see [[WP:INVALIDBIO]])
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Art of Problem Solving]] - Again, redirection would also have solved the problem.
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lifoti]] - Notable (or so it was thought at the time) founder, but no merge or redirect for whatever reason (it should be noted that the founder's article was later deleted).
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Grace (musical group)]] - Notable member, yet I was the only one who even mentioned an alternative to deletion. Also, despite ATD, [[WP:FAILN]], and even CSD policy itself (which does say ATD applies), my A7 decline on those grounds was "invalid reasoning".
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe (website)]] - You could be forgiven for thinking '''''I''''' was in the wrong just by mentioning alternatives! I'll let the AfD and [[User_talk:Adam9007/Archive_2#Notability_is_not_inherited|this "discussion"]] do the rest of the talking.
*[[GF Biochemicals]] - Here we likely had [[WP:ATD-E]] and [[WP:ATD-I]], but even in the worst case scenario, we had [[WP:ATD-R]]. But A7 prevailed per [[WP:NOTINHERITED]]. It was restored, not because it was decided the A7 was wrong, but because someone wanted to improve it. In fact, if memory serves, there was a pretty much unanimous consensus that it indeed ''should'' have been speedied under A7.  If I remember right, [[WP:ATD]] occurred to no-one (myself included if I'm not mistaken!). 
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Data Networking/Spring 2017/]] - [[WP:ATD-TRANS]] was obvious, but nope.
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Camp Camp]] - While this ''was'' redirected, from what I can tell it was entirely at the closer's discretion. Consensus was to delete and no alternative was considered.
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ajit Gunewardene (2nd nomination)]] - No redirect, going against [[WP:ATD-R]] and [[WP:INVALIDBIO]].
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Xtian de Medici]] - {{tquote|The topic is already covered in [[Gunner_de_Medici]]}}. So why not redirect there?
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Deep Eddy Vodka Distillery]] - {{tquote|the Heaven Hill article already mentions the brand}}. {{tquote|The parent article already mentions it}}. Same as above.
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Levi Sanders]] - Could have been redirected to his notable parent, but that wasn't talked about (another target was proposed, but that wasn't to be either).
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hurricane (group)]] - Apparently had a notable member, but wasn't merged or redirected.

There are likely many more out there (i do remember articles having merge/redirect targets getting speedied under A7, but can't remember what they were). I also noticed that an admin said [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)/Archive_140#Pruning/blanking_abandoned_very_bad_articles|here]] that many editors ignore ATD entirely, and I have to concur. I have to question [[WP:ATD]]'s status as policy, if it's ignored so easily so often. I can think of no other policy where you can easily get away with pretending it doesn't exist. ATD may be a good principle, but from what I can see it's far from a "widely accepted standard that all editors should normally follow". Policy is supposed to reflect the norm. not dictate it, no?

'''Should schools be disambiguated in the form "Name High School, Town" or "Name High School (Town)"?'''
My preference is to use a single comma, but two editors have commented this style is improper (without pointing to anywhere in the guidelines). A school doesn't fit well into either [[WP:NCCORP]] or [[WP:NCPLACE]]. In my view, a single comma is the most natural way to disambiguate, and in any case using brackets is grammatically incorrect (strictly it should be "Name High School (high school in Town)").

The RfC above is poorly framed and is asking for permission to use any source on the subject even when those sources do not mention e-cigarette marketing, promotion, or advertising. If the RfC was framed differently would editors give a different response? Can we use a source to address the marketing claims when that source does not specifically state it was in relation to the marketing claims? For example, can we use a source about the safety of e-cigarettes when the source did not indicate the safety information about e-cigarettes being discussed is in relation to the marketing of e-cigarettes? Using a source to address the marketing claims is done on a case-by-case basis.

{{rfcquote|text=
Before last night no dedicated article existed for the two PA congressional special elections that will be taking place this November. I created this one last night, and decided to create a single article for both elections. Here are my reasons for doing so
#I can't remember the last time two congressional special elections took place in the same state on the same day, so had no precedent to go off of.
#The elections are being held under the 2011 PA map which was invalidated by ''LWV v. PA'', meaning that the districts will functionally cease to exist the moment the election is certified.
#In addition, these are elections to the [[Lame-duck session]] of the [[115th United States Congress]], so the winners of these special elections will be serving their districts for a maximum of 2 months, lowering the stakes of these particular elections.
#The nominees for both parties are the same as the successor districts for the regular 2018 elections.

So: '''keep''' merged or '''separate'''? I welcome your comments. '''[[User:Nevermore27|<span style="color: #660198">Nevermore27</span>]]''' ([[User talk:Nevermore27|talk]]) 00:30, 6 August 2018 (UTC)}}

The difference between the two is that '''Proposed text #1''' is for all blocked users, while '''Proposed text #2''' is for all indefinitely blocked users. 

This proposal stems from the lengthy and divisive discussion at [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive991#Improper_use_of_talk_page_while_blocked|ANI]]. Please read through that discussion before commenting or voting here. Additionally, please comment on whether you support one version, both versions and the order you support them, or oppose to proposal entirely.

*The current policy language makes it sound as if what we would do in most cases is discuss the violation. 
*It’s been pretty long-standing practice at UAA that any blatant ORGNAME that has edited gets soft blocked. It is basically the tool of first resort, due to the fact that ORGNAMEs are by far the most common thing reported there and discussing with all of them would likely be a huge waste of time whereas soft blocking only takes a few seconds. 

So, since as they say policies should reflect practice, not dictate it, should language be added to the policy regarding the established practice of blocking ORGNAMEs that have made even one edit that signals a violation?

Nonetheless, conflicts and state-sanctioned murder, including the [[California Genocide]], continued throughout the West into the 1900s.<ref> Madley, Benjamin (2016).

The alteration of the word "sought" to "nominally promised" is to acknowledge the evidence that President Grant, author of the "Peace Policy" was not committed to what he promised, but actually sought war and violent removal, as in the Black Hills in 1875.<ref>“Utley wrote that Grant…and other government officials agreed that war was the best solution…the Indians…had been peaceful and did not intend war against the government.

{{rfcquote|text=
At this time, I think the article is adequately [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]-compliant on the topic of ROGD. However, it is clearly {{em|not}} NPOV-compliant on the topic of [[Lisa Littman]], the nominal subject of the page. It's still a [[WP:BLP|BLP]] that has instead become a [[WP:coatrack|coatrack]] for a [[WP:RECENT]] controversy, resulting in serious issues including [[WP:BALASP]].

Despite legitimate concerns about [[WP:RECENT|recentism]] and [[WP:NOTNEWS]], I think we have a consensus that the ROGD content of this article belongs in Wikipedia, {{em|somewhere}}. But there's no consensus about what action should be taken.

These are the possibilities that I see, and I'm inviting a discussion under each heading.

''' Promptly delete the entire BLP '''

Delete the entire article on [[Lisa Littman]], based on [[WP:BLP1E]] and lack of notability under [[WP:PROF]]:

I'm asking this [[User talk:Molecule Extraction#Pakatan Harapan colors: Is it red or light blue?|on behalf of the user who asking me in my talkpage]] regarding the colour that was used by the [[Pakatan Harapan]] (PH) coalition in the recent election. While it is acknowledged that the red colour (#C63B38 colour pattern) has been part of the colour symbol of PH coalition, the coalition [https://sg.news.yahoo.com/finally-pakatan-harapan-gets-registered-105315110.html was recently legalised when they won the 9 May election] with the colour began to be used officially. During the election, each parties in the coalition contesting using the flag of [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|People's Justice Party]] (PKR) with blue colour (#00ADEF colour pattern) for West Malaysia, while in East Malaysia each parties are free to use their respective flags with their own party colours. Both {{U|BrundtBank}} and {{U|Lazybugger13A}} agreed that the main colour that should be used for the entire election articles for [[WP:CONSISTENCY|consistency]] are the red one while {{U|*angys*}} disagreed with the decision as during the election, the coalition was not legalised yet with the parties in West Malaysia contesting under the PKR banner with the blue colour pattern.

What is the best term for Carina's relationship to the Collector in ''Guardians of the Galaxy''? 
*One side prefers '''''slave''''', since Carina is mistreated, seemingly unable to escape her situation, and at one point says "I will no longer be your slave." 
*The other side objects to this, preferring '''''assistant''''' or '''''aide''''', arguing that the quote is insufficient evidence because she could have used the term in a hyperbolic fashion. 
Sourcing is somewhat mixed on the matter, though there appears to be a slight bias towards ''slave''.

'''Discussion'''

*'''Yes''' - I've long wondered why we don't disallow highlighting in signatures. I get wanting flexibility for users to express themselves in different ways (obviously, I use some custom formatting in my own), and I would say that using different colors for the text seems reasonable. Using text highlighting does not. I find highlighted text incredible distracting to the point I have trouble focusing on the discussion as a whole, and trouble seeing the signatures of other participants. I suspect I'm not alone in that. We should not let signatures pull eyeballs from the substance of the discussion to draw focus on a single user's name. I've thought about proposing this RfC several times in the past, but looking at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Categories,_lists,_and_navigation_templates&oldid=859237467 this page] just now reminded me of how awful the effect is to my concentration. I imagine I'm not alone, but I suppose it's possible. (Sorry to {{u|woodensuperman}}, with whom I have no quarrel, but whose signature is the one I'm talking about on that page.

The article is written like a textbook on how to eradicate '''Suicide''' from a society, which is at the least offensive and at the most frightening to any who believe in a fundamental inalienable [[right to die]]. Having read [[WP:Offensive]], [[WP:IAR]] would apply for the sake of allowing others to form their own moral opinions, even if neutrality wasn't already a rule. Due-weight doesn't apply here, because no where in [[WP:NPOV]] have wikipedians collectively decided wikipedia's editorial voice should associate moral imperatives belonging to the predominant point-of-view with rigorously cited consensus and [[MOS:Alleged]] facts by how they are told--often by clumping facts useful one particular goal or another next to each other especially in the lede--even if that point-of-view as well as its moral imperatives are enforced by law in many reputable countries. Wikipedians wouldn't hypothetically allow Chinese officials write a communism article that clumps facts useful to writing communist law in the lede, why should suicide be any different?

The medical infobox also carries significant bias (like if an invented "eugenics" infobox plagued articles about ethnicities), though there isn't really a suitable substitute. I would say whatever infobox eventually appears on [[Fetishism]] would do, however in the meanwhile perhaps no infobox or [[Template:Infobox performing art]] instead?

If you disagree, please leave the banner up for at least a week or so to invited discussion from non-wikipedians. <s>I'm IP-editing</s> so I won't get notifications about this article and I don't want to get too emotionally invested. 04:07, 31 August 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Hello fellow Wikipedians,

We have an ensuing edit war in this article ([[Sofia Airport]]) which I would like your help in resolving. As a result you can also help clarify Wikipedia general policy on the matter.

I, and other users, claim that future routes in an article about an airport or airline - when properly referenced by an independent source e.g. an article in a neutral news site - is valid encyclopedic information. It is in fact common practice in airport articles across Wikipedia. As a result, we have been adding such information to this and other articles.

One other user claims the opposite, that all future route information is unencyclopedic and constitutes advertising and promotional information. As a result that user has been deleting all such information from this article, even when referenced to an independent source, and intends to do that in articles of other airports as well.

You can check out the history of the page for more details.

Your comments and clarifications are welcome. [[User:Tdunsky|Tdunsky]] ([[User talk:Tdunsky|talk]]) 05:46, 14 August 2018 (UTC)}}

This question has been discussed before, at [[#/Archive 32#A way forward?

{{rfcquote|text=
The use of the phrase "assigned at birth" and "assigned sex" is redundant and implies that there can be a different '''sex''' from the one a person is born with. Bypassing any opinions on "gender" as it is used in this article, it is biologically impossible to change one's '''sex'''. There is a [[Sex and gender distinction|WP article]] on this distinction (again, I am writing this in terms of the current WP world and do not intend to make a political/moral statement about this topic). 

I move and RfC that the statements containing these phrases should be reworded to reflect definition and the intended wikivoice here. An example:

::"Different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match up with the norm of their sex assigned at birth."

::To: "Different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match up with the normal attributes of their sex."

Again, even the [[Assigned sex|WP article on assigned sex]] is about the determination of a person's sex, and this sex cannot change. Gender is a separate beast here. I do think that perhaps for wikilinking purposes, it can be included once in the article, but it makes no sense to me to have it repeated in this fashion over and over, especially given that it could confuse the uninitiated reader about the accepted distinction between gender and sex.

This article is long and has a large focus on the history of hip-hop music. As articles are meant to be encyclopedic, this content is too dense and it may be worth looking into splitting some of it off into a new article (e.g. "Origins of hip hop music" or "History of hip hop music").

It is helpful to put yourself into the shoes of the average viewer. I would wager to guess that someone looking for an encyclopedic article on hip hop music ''''might'''' not want to read 20,000 words on the intricate and detailed history of the genre. This article needs generalization.

Let's RfC on a possible future preparation and move-rename of this page to "History of hip hop music" and linked creation of a new "Hip hop music" article. This would take a while, of course. Let me know what you think. - [[User:Dmezh|Dmezh]] ([[User talk:Dmezh|talk]]) 06:13, 20 August 2018 (UTC)}}

I would like to request an rfc on whether to update the template to pull in Wikdiata information. I do that their was an ArbCom notice back in November of last year about establishing need for it. I would like to suggest that this template be updated to use and pull the Wikidata information, such as the identifier id for it. While some may say why rely on Wikidata, while we should not you need to realize that most of our infobox's pull stuff from Wikidata especially those on our other language versions of Wikipedia, as that is why that project was founded as a catalog of information to make putting information into templates and connecting pages across the language spectrum easier. We don't need to update the template to only pull information from Wikidata but of course allow still the usage of putting the identifier id in manually. Some may think that opens it up to cross project vandalism, well maybe so but Wikidata does have active editors and admins that maintain it. --[[User:Clarkcj12|Clarkcj12]] ([[User talk:Clarkcj12|talk]]) 03:42, 29 August 2018 (UTC)}}

The article is written like a textbook on how to eradicate '''Suicide''' from a society, which is at the least offensive and at the most frightening to any who believe in a fundamental inalienable [[right to die]]. Having read [[WP:Offensive]], [[WP:IAR]] would apply for the sake of allowing others to form their own moral opinions, even if neutrality wasn't already a rule. Due-weight doesn't apply here, because no where in [[WP:NPOV]] have wikipedians collectively decided wikipedia's editorial voice should associate moral imperatives belonging to the predominant point-of-view with rigorously cited consensus and [[MOS:Alleged]] facts by how they are told--often by clumping facts useful one particular goal or another next to each other especially in the lede--even if that point-of-view as well as its moral imperatives are enforced by law in many reputable countries. Wikipedians wouldn't hypothetically allow Chinese officials write a communism article that clumps facts useful to writing communist law in the lede, why should suicide be any different?

The medical infobox also carries significant bias (like if an invented "eugenics" infobox plagued articles about ethnicities), though there isn't really a suitable substitute. I would say whatever infobox eventually appears on [[Fetishism]] would do, however in the meanwhile perhaps no infobox or [[Template:Infobox performing art]] instead?

If you disagree, please leave the banner up for at least a week or so to invited discussion from non-wikipedians. <s>I'm IP-editing</s> so I won't get notifications about this article and I don't want to get too emotionally invested. 04:07, 31 August 2018 (UTC)}}

I've seen reports recently that the Australian Flag Society has now become part of Anzac folklore for having discovered a national treasure in the form of the Australian flag used by the 2/23rd battalion on Tarakan. Should we therefore remove the notability tag at this point? They've been around for a lot of years now. They are relatively well known in Queensland for all these syndicated newspaper artciles. https://www.facebook.com/Australian.Flag.Society/photos/a.210701592278728/2224884557527078 .

The question is should the former sections entitled Australian flag at war and Centenary and other notable flags be featured on the flag of Australia page or elsewhere?

The "Australian flag at war" and "Centenary and other notable flags" sections have been removed ostensibly on the grounds that the material is POV and trivial. But I see that the sources were all non partisan and verifiable and the presentation was encyclopedic. The only what you might call hyperbole comes from direct quotes. And how trivial could some of this content be given the large number of references that were supplied? For example just look at the entry for the "parliament house centenary flag" for one. Some of these national treasures such as the "Australian moon flag" are even notable enough to warrant a separate article of their own really.

Should we stop having AfD renominations at separate pages named "2nd nomination", "3rd nomination", etc., and instead just place renominations under previous nominations at the original AfD page? This has been suggested by [[User:Kaldari|Kaldari]] at [[phab:T169441]]. If so, then this would make it consistent with renominations on Wikimedia Commons. Also, if this RfC passes, then the aforementioned Phabricator task should be closed as declined. And MfDs should then be treated similar to AfDs, with new nominations under old ones. Finally, Twinkle would then be modified to edit the original AfD or MfD page instead of creating a new one.

::::MR X. no, everyone does not agree with your statement nor the sources  as some have stated that they are both too vague and opinionative, the date is arbitrary (on a side note I would bet even the author of the New Yorker article would agree with that) and i'm going add both are bias against chick fi la. Also, what I stated initially is still true. The other secondary sources (which are obviously bias and anti chick fi la) that were added were disagreed with then just put back in. The current statement was disagreed with then added too as well. It is like the people who disagreed with the statement/source did not have the power to edit because the page was locked but the people who agree with it came in and edited it because they did have the power. 

Most importantly, Chick fi la has only donated to only 1-2 anti lbgt groups since 2012  which is a significant decrease since they were exposed. This page doesn't state that at all. The qutoe say "groups" pulling from the new yorker (again with the gross vagaries) when we have secondary source articles stating the specific groups (only one or two) they actually donate too. This makes chick fi la sound a lot worse than it is, hence the bias. We have other secondary sources with better more specific information than the new yorker piece. If this particular  New Yorker article was not written as a satirical, slanderous, op-ed piece then I would say leave it, but it is. 

The source and statement still most be changes and be replaced with more the more specific, non bias articles mentioned in this thread such as the business insider and goqnotes (an article on chick fi la from a queer website) articles.

"We don't debate Truth, and we definitely do not deal with "hard evidence". Truth and evidence count for almost nothing under Wikipedia policies and decision making processes.

We limit the use of [[WP:primary|primary]] sources such as tax forms. In particular it would be a violation of policy [[WP:SYNTH|SYNTH]] to use tax forms to support this kind of claim. We mainly rely on secondary sources. The existing Newyorker reference is fine. It's a reputable source for news and information, and we can report what they say. If there were contradictory sources then we would have something to sort out.

Per {{reply to|Only in death}}'s request, I have formally included a request for comments regarding Lori Maddox's inclusion in this article. The reasons I give are listed in the above "Lori Maddox" section. To summarize them briefly, his involvement with her is well-documented. Even the [[Rolling Stone]] publication has admitted to the facts of the nature of their relationship. The biggest reason she has NOT been included, according to the discussion above, is because of the back-and-forth edit warring that went on regarding HOW to include her. I believe that the difficulties in reaching an agreement on how to include her in the article do not justify leaving her out altogether.

For the reasons above, I have created this request for comments to answer the following question: **Should Lori Maddox be mentioned in the article?** (We can leave the "how" to a later discussion IF the consensus here is "yes." For now, I just want to see if there is a consensus that she SHOULD be included). Obviously my vote is "yes." [[User:Et0048|Et0048]] ([[User talk:Et0048|talk]]) 19:44, 5 September 2018 (UTC)}}

The guideline '''currently contains the following wording''':

{{talkquote|The point of these template boxes is not to list every single redirect for any given page (indeed, that's what [[Special:WhatLinksHere]] is for); instead, they generally should list only one or two common and easily remembered redirects.}}

This guideline has been largely ignored by the community for almost ten years and for good reasons, so I changed this to 

{{talkquote|The point of these template boxes is not to list every single redirect for any given page (indeed, that's what [[Special:WhatLinksHere]] is for); instead, they generally should list <del>only one or two</del> <ins>the most</ins> common and easily remembered redirects.}}

but was reverted.

I thus formerly '''propose this change be implemented''' as it reflects standard and current practice as evidenced by [[WP:V]], [[WP:NOT]], [[WP:DEL]], [[WP:EP]] and [[WP:NPOV]] to name but a few core policy pages. While listing all possible shortcuts is overkill, it's also [[WP:COMMONSENSE]] that there should not be an artificial limit. If a page has four common shortcuts, they should be listed and if it only has one, so be it. Removing shortcuts solely for the sake of removing a certain number strikes me as [[WP:BURO|following the letter of the rules for the sake of following the rules without thought of whether doing so really improves the project]] (something, ironically, I have been accused of in the past).

'''This RFC is ''only'' about whether the wording should be changed from "only one or two" to "the most". '''

* RFC Text:

The current guidelines were adopted around 15 years ago and have led to numerous editorial contradictions and circular discussions. This means the guidelines don't work properly and need updating. It is even questionable whether there ever has been a consensus created. I hope a healthy debate will follow here first. Many other editors who use the various county related sites should also be advised of this discussion, and someone might also begin a [[wp:RfC|Request for Comment]].

The current guidelines are factually incorrect in claiming the historic counties no longer exist. This is probably the route cause of most of the problem. The use of the word 'county' to refer to different things comes a close second. Change will not be easy because there are so many inter-connected articles and assumptions, but change is necessary. We must keep any changes simple and not get trapped into discussing the minutiae. However, precision is important, because the lack of it has led to the current muddle. I very much think we should avoid discussing at any length whether historic counties exist of not. Some people just don't get it so we are better off just accepting that and moving forward. I propose the following:

'''1/ When referring to a county, the default meaning is the traditional/historic county'''. Different meanings of any name are qualified by such words as Essex (Ceremonial county). It is more often than not that confusion arises by using the ceremonial county as the default, even though it was originally thought this would not be the case.

This means, for example, there will be an article named Essex dealing with the historic county and one called Essex (Ceremonial county) dealing with the more recent area. The current Essex article will not change much, and would have a small sub-section on recent local govt, referring to the CC article: the new article, Essex (CC) would deal only with that county, mainly local government. This is no different from countless other article topics.

'''2/  Have separate articles for the different types of county'''. Combining everything together is not practically possible without making [[wp:pov|POV]] assumptions that trigger the endless edit wars. Inserting opinions and false information not backed by the evidence or by closer examination does Wikipedia a dis-service.

'''3/  Use the term 'traditional' county (as does the govt), because 'historic' can be confusing.''' The use of the word historic has caused much of the misunderstanding that has created the confusion.

...If we adopt these two changes alone, there will be limited need to change the numerous contradictions in the articles because the changes once made will easily lead to the fairly quick ironing out by editors of so many problems caused by the current way of handling counties. There will be problems relating to each county but they will be reasonably easy to deal with once we have adopted point 1 above.

{{rfcquote|text=
I'd like to propose amending our naming format for elections/referendums to move the year to the front of the title; so, for example, [[French presidential election, 2017]] would be [[2017 French presidential election]]. I think this has several advantages:
#It brings election articles in line with the vast majority of other articles with years in the title
#It allows the article titles to be used in prose, as the current format cannot be used (one could say "the [[2017 German federal election]] resulted in a hung parliament")
#It would make certain election articles titles more logical (for instance [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2018]] would become [[2018 United States Senate election in Florida]]
#It would make the titles of related articles more logical (for instance [[Fundraising in the United States presidential election, 2016]] would become [[Fundraising in the 2016 United States presidential election]])
#It would automatically sort elections by year in categories

I mentioned this a year ago at [[WP:E&R]] and a valid point was raised that currently you can start searching "French presidential election" and you get the whole list. This is an advantage, but as far as I can see, the only one. A way to keep this benefit is to still create redirects from these titles.

This will involve moving many thousands of articles (I will notify as many relevant WPs as I can find), so I propose that if this passes, a bot run is set up to do it.

Recently, a [[Special:AbuseFilter/930|new edit filter]] was created which disallowed new users indexing pages in userspace.

This is a proposal to put all AfC status templates, maintenance templates, comments, and such on the draft talk page instead of the draft page, where they currently are. This would enable reviewers and draft authors to hold normal conversations on the talk page, and would (as a side effect) retain all conversation if the draft is moved to mainspace. A general disclaimer-style AfC banner will remain on the draft page, informing readers that the draft is not an article yet. A script (or Lua template) can also be written to summarize the status of the draft so far, for use by reviewers and others interested in AfC reviewing operations.

There is an issue currently with the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion policy]] (PROD) which is causing some confusion and ambiguity. In January this year, user {{ul|Green Giant}} [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Proposed_deletion&diff=next&oldid=823134643 boldly edited the policy] to simplify the wording, but in doing so, changed the ''suggestion'' to notify article creators to a ''requirement''. It appears as though this was not compelled by any discussion to make that change, and it was also certainly in good faith and possibly not intended to have changed the meaning in this way. Up until this change, our various deletion policies all suggested notifying article creators and significant contributors as a courtesy, but did not require it (and requiring AfD notification is a [[Wikipedia:Perennial proposals#All authors must be notified of deletion|perennial proposal]]). With Green Giant's change, PROD stands out as the only deletion process requiring notification. The change has also not been well publicized or recognized - this post is inspired by an editor reported to ANI for failing to notify, and several editors and administrators responding that they were not aware of the change.

I am proposing a <s>three-pronged</s> discussion/straw poll to determine the community's current opinions about proposed deletion. Please comment in one of the sections below.

Recently, the paragraphs in the lead were [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kind_of_Blue&type=revision&diff=796808681&oldid=796668435 rearranged] by {{u|Lawrencekhoo}}, so that information about the album's release date, recording, and the musician's concept for the album were replaced in the first paragraph with information about how the album has been critically received, accolades, and so forth. Lawrencekhoo cited the guideline that the lead should establish notability of the topic. In restoring the original layout, I cited [[MOS:LEAD]] which says the lead paragraph "should establish the context in which the topic is being considered by supplying the set of circumstances or facts that surround it," and in my opinion, critical opinions are not facts. The practice throughout WP:ALBUMS articles appears to prioritize the original layout here, but admittedly my opinion is not a strong one when reading: "The notability of the article's subject is usually established in the first few sentences. Like in the body of the article itself, the emphasis given to material in the lead should roughly reflect its importance to the topic, according to reliable, published sources." So I'm not sure.

Here are some claims taken from the article [[Dark wave]], followed by the cited text used to support that claim. Please pay '''close attention''' to the phrasing of the claim and the phrasing of the sources. Ask yourself, "are they 100% saying the same thing?"
{{talkquote|
{{div col}}
* '''Claim A:''' [[Coldwave]] is a subgenre of dark wave
*: '''Source:''' "{{tq|Dark Wave is a [...] generic term for dark varieties of the Wave, which also subsumes Gothic. Cold Wave is a subgenus of experimental, minimalist electronic music from France.}}" (translated from German)
* '''Claim B:''' Some instruments that are common to dark wave include guitar, bass guitar, drum machine, cello, piano, and samplers
*: '''Source:''' same as above
* '''Claim C:''' [[Neofolk]] is a subgenre of dark wave
*: '''Source:''' "{{tq|The dark wave scene is divided among other things in the classic dark wave, gothic rock, electronic groups or even the neofolk.}}" (translated from German)
* '''Claim D:''' Dark wave borrows elements from the [[post-industrial]] genre.
*: '''Source:''' "{{tq|At first, there wasn't the same sort of [Goth] scene and we were in more of an '[[industrial music|industrial]]' thing. There was nothing like the clubs you get now [...] it's not just Goth, it's a mix - Darkwave or whatever.}}" [http://sortedmagazine.com/archive/magazine/sordid/attrition.htm]
*  '''Claim E''': Gary Numan and Depeche Mode were associated with gothic rock and synthesizer-based new wave music
*: '''Source:''' "{{tq|The term "darkwave" came from back in the 1980s, and was one of the terms used to describe [the] Golden Age [of gothic rock] bands, as well as dark electronica acts like Gary Numan and Depeche Mode.}}" [http://www.houstonpress.com/music/the-seven-ages-of-goth-6500894]

Based on these examples, is it reasonable to suggest that the article possibly contains [[WP:SYNTH|synthesized claims]], or [[WP:STICKTOSOURCE|claims that are not supported by the sources]]?

Should the following section be included in {{sectionlink|Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|Questionable sources}}?
{{tq2|

''' Web content by non-staff contributors '''

{{Shortcut|WP:CONTRIBUTOR|WP:CONTRIBUTORS}}
On [[Online newspaper|news websites]], [[periodical]] websites (excluding [[academic journals]]), and [[blog]]s, [[web content]] authored by non-staff [[Freelancer|contributors]] is questionable, even if it is published in a source that is otherwise reliable. Compared to [[staff writer]]s, contributors are subject to reduced editorial oversight and have a lesser reputation for fact-checking and error correction. Reliable publications distinguish articles written by staff writers from ones written by contributors by indicating the author's job title in the [[byline]]. Less reputable sources only display the author's job title on their profile page or the website's [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]].

Examples of sources that publish content from non-staff contributors include [[WP:RSP#Forbes.com contributors|Forbes.com]] and ''[[WP:RSP#HuffPost contributors|HuffPost]]''.

[[Opinion piece]]s in reliable sources have their [[#Statements of opinion|own guideline]], which applies in addition to this one.

About 2 or 3 years ago, on a related WikiProject page (I can't exactly remember which), it was ''agreed'' to use <u>Nominator</u>, rather then <u>Appointer</u> in the infoboxes of justices & judges, for what the president's role was in the person getting on to a court seat. Though I've just noticed that over the last little while, 'someone' had been gradually changing 'nominator' to appointer' for the lower court judges? the Supreme Court chief justices & associate justices continued to use 'nominator', until today (concerning the most recent & current). Therefore, for consistency sake, can we ''again'' come to a consensus on which terminology to use for '''all''' these bios?

One view is that we should go with the non-cropped version because of [[WP:NOTCENSORED]]. The other view is that WP:NOTCENSORED is tempered by [[Wikipedia:Offensive material]], and it guides editors to not unnecessarily include the more offensive image if an equally suitable alternative is available.

*'''Cropped version'''. Above, I noted that I personally have no problem with the image that JeffyP uploaded, but some of our readers will, and no one has given a valid reason for going with it over the cropped one I uploaded years ago. I work on a number of sexual topics, and readers commonly object to images of bare breasts and images of genitals. The cropped image of the nude Rose is therefore the less offensive of the two options, and it has caused no issues while the one that JeffyP undoubtedly will. I know from experience that we will have readers and editors wanting to remove the fully nude image. And no one has given a valid reason as to why the fully nude image is better than the cropped image with regard to enhancing readers' understanding of the text.

This RfC concerns [[Same-sex marriage#Opposition|this]] section of the article. It [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Same-sex_marriage&oldid=861550888#Opposition currently] states, "''These claims are refuted by science which shows that homosexuality is a natural and normal human sexuality, that sexual orientation cannot be chosen or influenced, and that the children of same-sex couples fare just as well or even better than the children of opposite-sex couples.''" One view is that current sourcing for the final sentence in the first paragraph of the section should be trimmed because it is extreme [[WP:Citation overkill]] (ending with 21 citations), and also that the sentence partly misrepresents the literature since scientists have not ruled out the influence of social factors on sexual orientation; rather, with regard to social factors, they state "weak evidence," "unlikely to influence" and "no substantive evidence," or "a complex combination of biological and social factors." Both parenting and child abuse are seen by scientists as very unlikely to influence sexual orientation, however. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Same-sex_marriage&oldid=861547939#Opposition This] version of the section trimmed the sourcing to six citations and uses "unlikely to be influenced by social factors such as parenting or child abuse," with a source to support it.

Traditionally, we have handled reports on users with mild violations and no edits by placing them in the holding pen. After sitting there for a week or two these reports are reviewed again to see if they have edited in the meantime. This strikes me as needless busywork and I would suggest we change the procedure so that adding the “wait” response to a report is considered declining the report and it is simply removed a while later like other declined reports, leaving only “being discussed with user” and “keep monitoring” as the only reports that go to holding. Having reviewed hundreds if not thousands of such reports I feel the risk is fairly low, usually if they don’t edit the day the create the account they don’t edit at all. In the rare cases where they do edit, they can be re-reported at UAA and blocked. [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 18:09, 6 October 2018 (UTC)}}

Hi, short summary: Question: "Was there Norse habitat on the island of Ösel during the viking era?" Some editors like me and several others claim there are no sources for this. Some editors claim there was Norse habitat on the island of Ösel. The question is about updating the map in question (linked above and in the article), which currently claims there was Norse habitat, but does not include sources. [[File_talk:Viking_Expansion.svg#Areas_in_Estonia|The connected talk page with opinions is here]]. There is also a talk discussion thread on this talk page above. This is connected to the wider topic of "Who were the [[Oeselians]]?", who were also called "Vikings from Estonia". The main options have been either "we don't know" or "Estonians". But this is not the current question. The current question is - is there credible proof for Norse population on the island of Ösel in the viking era? If not, the color of Ösel should be changed on the map. [[User:Blomsterhagens|Blomsterhagens]] ([[User talk:Blomsterhagens|talk]]) 17:01, 1 October 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Having setup articles for all of the [[Water Resource Region]]s, I think it makes sense to create a Category tree for North America using the USGS [[Hydrological_code#United_StatesHydrological Unit Codes]]. The USGS HUCs include small portions of Canada and Mexico, but eventually the goal would be for a category tree that fully includes Mexico and Canada using the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]]'s (CEC) water basin boundaries that span all three countries. An example of my proposed initial structure is as follows
*[[:Category:Bodies of water of North America]]
**[[:Category:Water resource regions]]
***[[:Category:Missouri water resource region]] - Region level HUC 10). Note that some standalone US Regions are subsumed below the Mississippi in the CEC classification scheme
****[[:Category:Gasconade–Osage water resource subregion]] - Subregion level HUC 1029)
*****[[:Category:Osage basin]] - Basin level HUC 102901
******[[:Category:Sac subbasin]] - Subbasin level HUC 10290106
In theory, while the latest USGS update may have some slightly HUC mappings, I haven't been able to easily find descriptive titles or listing of HUCs for that data. Also, I wasn't planning on setting up categories below the subbasin level, both because I haven't ever found descriptive names at this level, although it is certainly possible they exist. My overall approach would be to start creating a few of the region level categories and add a couple bodies of water to each one. I'd be interested in people's thoughts on this topic.

{{rfcquote|text=
After a long and broad discussion about schools' notability criteria in this talk page, a formal [[WP:RFC|Request for Comments]] is hereby initiated. Participants are asked about the criteria to be used in deciding if a [[school]] merits a Wikipedia article. (Please note that the criteria would be equally applied for schools in every region and country.) Interested editors are invited to consult [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability_(organizations_and_companies)#Schools_in,_forever|the afore-mentioned discussion]] and [[WP:SCHOOLOUTCOMES]]. The options are as follows:
#'''Schools are inherently notable''' when they exist, their existence [[WP:V|verified]] on the basis of [[WP:RS|reliable and not primary sources]]. 
#'''Schools follow the standard rules for notability of article subjects''', on the same basis.

'''Comment by the nominator'''

*The RfC aims to remove the vagueness of the current state of affairs. Notability of schools is not assessed uniformly and with constant criteria across countries or even within the same country. Some articles remain while others do not, without  significant differences in their notability. The disparity of editors' viewpoint on criteria is wide (see discussion). The community should decide which is the preferable way forward. If either option is chosen we shall have a clear guideline. A few editors welcome fog in Wikipedia's rules (again, see discussion) and this RfC is an opportunity to address tangentially that issue as well, i.e. a no-consensus outcome would essentially retain the vagueness. If, on the other hand, there are editors who believe the situation is already quite clear, all they have to do is denote that situation in their suggestion. Take care, all. -[[User:The Gnome|The Gnome]] ([[User talk:The Gnome|talk]]) 07:48, 11 October 2018 (UTC)}}

Per {{reply to|Only in death}}'s request, I have formally included a request for comments regarding Lori Maddox's inclusion in this article. The reasons I give are listed in the above "Lori Maddox" section. To summarize them briefly, his involvement with her is well-documented. Even the [[Rolling Stone]] publication has admitted to the facts of the nature of their relationship. The biggest reason she has NOT been included, according to the discussion above, is because of the back-and-forth edit warring that went on regarding HOW to include her. I believe that the difficulties in reaching an agreement on how to include her in the article do not justify leaving her out altogether.

For the reasons above, I have created this request for comments to answer the following question: **Should Lori Maddox be mentioned in the article?** (We can leave the "how" to a later discussion IF the consensus here is "yes." For now, I just want to see if there is a consensus that she SHOULD be included).

Do you think that the DH Lawrence Wikipedia page and the ‘Philosophy and Politics’ section in particular should include differing perspectives on whether Lawrence held authoritarian, even ‘proto-fascist’, views throughout his adult life? More particularly, do you think that the views of Bertrand Russell and Terry Eagleton should be counter-balanced by the inclusion of the views of prominent biographers of Lawrence, John Worthen and Brenda Maddox, who quote letters written later in life by Lawrence, and by the inclusion of a quote from Lawrence’s own essay ‘Democracy’?

'''Background:''' There are a few terms that may be derogatory to some but are generally acceptable in talk page/edit summary usage; amongst these, one such term is "fuck off". Past discussions on whether repetitively using the term "fuck off" at other editors is sanctionable have been inconclusive, with a broad leaning towards this being non-sanctionable.

Over the past recent years, Wikipedia's reach and editor base has grown significantly beyond the West, reaching highly populated English speaking countries like India, which may or may not subscribe to the cultural ethos of language usage subscribed to by Western editors. With the premise that Wikipedia should be inclusive for all global communities involved in editing, I wish to re-assess current community consensus on the talk page usage of the term "fuck off" targeted at other editors.

I am okay if the community still considers this term non-sanctionable, or sanctionable, or even if there is inconclusive consensus – but a benchmark here would allow clarity on how to assess responses at various desks when editors complain at being told to "fuck off".

Therefore, I request the community to comment on the following specific query:

*'''Should the <u>"repetitive usage"</u> of the term <u>"fuck off"</u> by an editor targeted at other editors be considered "sanctionable"?<sup>***</sup>'''
:<small>*** "Sanctionable" refers to the broad universe of escalating warnings, which may lead to blocks, bans, restrictions etcetera if the editor ignores these warnings.</small>

Recently, [[Wikipedia:Today's featured article|TFA]]s have been the target for severe vandalism, and the enormous majority of them end up being semi-protected at the end of the day. More particularly, they have been the target for an IP-hopper who adds obscene images at 550px on the top of the TFA, with some of his vandalism staying for several minutes even being removed by IP readers. I myself have loaded a TFA once with a vagina image on it, and I suppose I'm not the only reader to have done so. I have received the opinion of several editors that we should semi-protect TFAs automatically, but I have also seem valid objections that TFAs are supposed to illustrate the principle of Wikipedia, and indeed, there are occasional constructive edit from IPs on TFAs. I therefore propose that we pending-changes protect TFAs automatically (via {{U|TFA Protector Bot}}) so that we will still be able to have constructive edits from time to time, but high-resolution obscene images will not be publicly viewable. With PCP, TFAs will still be part of the encyclopedia anyone can edit, but although typos might stay for a couple minutes more, they will be free from vandalism. <span style="text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml">[[User:L293D|<b style="color:#060">L293D</b>]]&nbsp;([[User talk:L293D#top|<b style="color:#000">☎</b>]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/L293D|<b style="color:#000">✎</b>]])</span> 23:46, 13 October 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I am starting to doubt the notability of this TV series for a few reasons.

First of all, the author isn't even notable enough to warrant her own article. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Susan_Meddaugh&type=revision&diff=525453646&oldid=479486341 this diff]. I don't even think the book is notable because it only has one source. I am requesting a deletion discussion at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Martha Speaks (book)]].

Second of all, even one [[Talk:Helen Lorraine|one Wikipedia editor referred to Martha Speaks as "not even meet[ing] notability guidelines"]].

Third, it relies heavily on first-party (primary) sources for its essential (important) information. There are only three second-party sources - two of them are dead links, the third was published 10 years ago. Thus, the editor above could be right about the TV show failing [[WP:GNG]]. As an ordinary children's show, it probably would never get worldwide significance and recognition. Exponentially far more TV shows have worldwide recognition than do — and the difference between a show that gets an article and a show that doesn't is not a matter of "any show gets to have one as soon as an editor actually takes the time to make one", but of "shows only get one if their characters actually receive real-world coverage and analysis of their significance". Unfortunately, Martha Speaks failed the test, big time. 

The [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Martha_Speaks_characters|characters list]] was redirected in a deletion discussion a few weeks ago. Additionally, the characters's individual articles have been redirected for lack of notability:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Helen%20Lorraine&action=history][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martha%20(Martha%20Speaks)&action=history][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mariella%20Lorraine&action=history][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alice%20Boxwood&action=history][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Draft:Daniel_Lorraine]

Even think about it, think about more notable shows like [[VeggieTales]] and [[Danny Phantom]]. Those shows warrant articles and character lists because of their massive notability. If you even asked me, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Danny_Phantom_(character) Daniel Fenton], [https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=ceB&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&channel=rcs&biw=1680&bih=865&tbs=ar%3A1&tbm=nws&q=%22Bob+the+Tomato%22+%22Larry+the+Cucumber%22&oq=%22Bob+the+Tomato%22+%22Larry+the+Cucumber%22&gs_l=serp.3...5465.11062.0.11271.5.5.0.0.0.0.250.789.1j3j1.5.0...0.0...1c.1.5.serp.5qhvVeOS78Y Bob the Tomato, and Larry the Cucumber] themselves would be notable to warrant their own articles. But as seen in the much above more discussions, Helen Lorraine, her Daniel Fenton-inspired father, and Mariella clearly aren't even notable to warrant any. [[Arthur (TV series)]] is much more notable and has its titular protagonist warrant an article. Just because Martha Speaks is affiliated with a notable TV show doesn't mean it is just as notable.

A search of [https://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=martha+speaks&acc=off&wc=on&fc=off&group=none Martha Speaks on JSTOR provides 0 sufficient results]. The show is mentioned in some RS but they aren't independent of the topic in question. [https://www.google.co.nz/search?biw=1600&bih=789&tbm=nws&ei=59jnW4uMNNL39QOq-7XIAw&q=martha+speaks&oq=martha+speaks&gs_l=psy-ab.3...60.214.0.379.3.3.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..3.0.0....0.RrRCtInrAxU Zero results on Google News also].

Here are some reasons why I can argue that Martha Speaks is not notable. Being an average and now cancelled TV show, it would take a long time for it to reach notability standards, unlike VT, DP, and Arthur.

===Proposal'''

The current guidelines here:

:At the WikiProject UK geography, we believe the counties of the United Kingdom are important subjects. In order to facilitate the development of these subdivisions of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the following guidelines have been put together.
:In the United Kingdom, the meaning of "county" can be confusing. There are several types of official administrative area that are described as counties due to historical modifications of the borders, and because the extent of the "administrative county boundaries" are often not exactly the same as the ceremonial and ancient county boundaries by of the same name; the counties of England and Waleshave undergone vast geographic transformation in the last few centuries; the counties of Scotland were officially abolished but their territory (in some cases) exist with a ceremonial role; likewise the counties of Northern Ireland have no administrative role, but are used for geographic demarcation and lieutenancy.
:In respect of England, Scotland and Wales, a fundamental part of this guide is to reaffirm the long established position that we do not take the view that the historic/ancient/traditional counties still exist with the former boundaries. Unless (using consensus) a good reason is made not to, the article should describe any administrative and ceremonial changes differences within one article, including any difference in the statistics between them. In England and Wales, where the historic county boundaries are different to modern boundaries the article should discuss these differences, and not be split into new "Historic county of Exampleshire" articles.
:Where counties have been abolished or no longer serve any municipal role (such as Cumberland or Ross-shire) these should have their own articles, but maintain that they no longer function as contemporary counties/subdivisions of territory.

Should be replaced with this:

:In the United Kingdom, the meaning of "county" can be confusing. There are several types of demarcation areas, fulfilling different roles, that are described as counties. They often use the same or similar names and cover similar geographical areas. The main demarcation types are the traditional counties, that have developed over centuries and different administrative areas, such as the ceremonial counties, that have been created by various legislation from the late 19th century onwards. A common misconception is that the legislation that created the administrative areas has also abolished the traditional counties. There is no evidence to support this claim.
:Unless (using consensus) a very good reason is made not to, the article with the name of a traditional county should be about that traditional county. Any administrative area, ceremonial county or other demarcation area with the same or similar name as a traditional county, should be described briefly within the traditional county article but have an article of its own dealing specifically and in greater detail with that other type of county or administrative area. For example, the article entitled ‘Essex’ will be about the traditional county. Reference to its governance will be made in the article, including the area currently administered by London boroughs within Greater London, such as Romford, and areas such as Southend that are administered by unitary authorities. More detail about local government in Romford, since 1965 when the London borough of Havering was created, will be dealt with in the ‘Havering’ article.

In practice very little will change except removing the contradictions caused by the non-referenced and incorrect assertion that the traditional counties have been abolished or altered. Currently, there are different articles dealing with the different areas anyway, so no new ones will be created and to claim otherwise, as some of us are doing, or to claim excessive doubling-up, is misleading. All that will happen is that the counties/areas different roles will be more clearly and more accurately defined, which is what wikipedia is here to do. Therefore, this proposal will actually simplify and clarify matters, having the opposite effect to what the neigh-sayers claim it will have.

(References to back both sides and to give relevant weight will follow. Any help in this regard would be welcome, but please avoid using any ambiguous citations that do not define what county is referred to, or citations that reference back to or feed off each other.)

Right, there has been some discussion at [[Talk:Panthera_leo_leo#Merge?]] and sections below it over what and how lion taxonomy is discussed on wikipedia. Right now we have:

* [[lion]] - a Featured Article (''recently genetic research has reduced the subspecies from lots to just two'')
** ''[[Panthera leo leo]]'' -  a stubby article that is in effect a disambiguation page to:
*** [[Barbary lion]]
*** [[West African lion]]
*** [[Central African lion]]
*** [[Asiatic lion]]
** ''[[Panthera leo melanochaita]]'' -  a stubby article that is in effect a disambiguation page to:
*** [[Cape lion]]
*** [[East African lion]]
*** [[Southern African lion]]

We also have:
* [[African lion]]
* [[Northern lion]] - synonymous with ''[[Panthera leo leo]]'' (???)

*[[History of lions in Europe]]
** [[American lion]]
** [[Sri Lanka lion]]
** [[Gaetulian lion]]
** [[Cultural depictions of lions]]

Note that we do ''not'' have a [[Taxonomy of lions]] or [[Lion conservation]] page. 

Please, can as many folks as possible look over the pages involved and give opinions below onto which pages should be separate or upmerged or split or rearranged? Some options include moving all material into a [[Taxonomy of lions]] page, plus just the two subspecies.

The issue isn't one of Creation Science but one of [[WP:NPOV|neutrality]], where the language in the article that declares that:
:"Abiogenesis or origin of life <u>is the natural process by which life arises from non-living matter</u> 
is not NPOV because it asserts a thesis that life comes about through an "[[up from the muck]]" process only, which is vastly overreaching and overstated, and categorically rules out "[[down from the stars]]" theories. Rowan claims science is agnostic, then the POV here is that science and the article should remain agnostic and not atheistic.

:''Was'' "Science as a compendium of revelations from God "
There is an idea of science as being exclusively a revelation from nature, but the idea of science as being the revelations of God has some history in philosophy, and in the religionist's accommodating usage of "philosophy" and "science" (note similarity in meaning) as fitting in a Holy perspective. For example, claims and references to claims like "[in] the prolegomena to Aristotle’s Physica, [Girolamo] [[Girolamo Zanchi|Zanchi]] makes the case that philosophy ultimately comes to man by divine revelation"[https://calvinistinternational.com/2017/02/10/zanchis-aristotle-4-philosophy-as-revelation/]. 

Some might read that as philsophy and not science, but the connection between science and philosophy is deep, and of late is perhaps misconveyed as distant, such that philosophy connotes soft and unrigourous research which includes the possibility of God, while "science" has become a code word for 'atheistic research only.' I suggested at [[WP:VP/I#Articles which ask a question|WP:VP/I]] that we have articles which ask questions, but first perhaps a single article on the "[[Big questions]]" is required. One of the big questions we know by heart and mind is "[[is there a God?]]" From that basis, treatment of God as a possibility can be asked as a question, and then the treatment of God as an object for scientific proof. Dear science, can there be <s>some connection between science and philosophy and religion?</s> -[[User:Inowen|Inowen]] ([[User talk:Inowen|nlfte]]) 04:16, 11 November 2018 (UTC)}}

As this discussion is rapidly spinning out of control (witness multiple sections being opened on the same topic and attempts to centralize the discussion being reverted), it appears a more formal (and widely publicized) solution is in order.

The question is: 

'''What if anything should we include at this time on the "Nazi salute controversy"?'''

It's also fairly clear we have four choices:
#Some variation (subject to discussion on the finer points) of what existed [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baraboo_High_School&diff=prev&oldid=868681256 here].
#Nothing.
#Nothing for now, revisiting in say three months so we can accurately gauge the enduring nature of this information.
#A brief discussion of the school itself's role in this.

After what is turning out to be an unsuccessful proposal at [[Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion#Proposal/RfC - Extend WP:U5 to the draftspace]], I have come up with something new.

''' Web content by non-staff contributors '''

{{Shortcut|WP:CONTRIBUTOR|WP:CONTRIBUTORS}}
On [[Online newspaper|news websites]], [[periodical]] websites (excluding [[academic journals]]), and [[blog]]s, [[web content]] authored by non-staff [[Freelancer|contributors]] is questionable if the contributors are subject to reduced editorial oversight, even if the web content is published in a source that is otherwise reliable. Compared to [[staff writer]]s, contributors generally have a lesser reputation for fact-checking and error correction. Reliable publications distinguish articles written by staff writers from ones written by contributors by indicating the author's job title in the [[byline]]. Less reputable sources only display the author's job title on their profile page or the website's [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]].

Examples of sources that publish content from non-staff contributors include [[WP:RSP#Forbes.com contributors|Forbes.com]] and ''[[WP:RSP#HuffPost contributors|HuffPost]]''.

[[Opinion piece]]s in reliable sources have their [[#Statements of opinion|own guideline]], which applies instead of this one.

== Not biased. '''

Part of the article contains critiques on Moro, but article itself is not biased as it contains no subjective matter, only well-sourced facts. For balancing, needs more content on so-called achievements instead of deleting sourced content. Critiques on article, on the other hand, are biased as they state sources aren't reliable when they're established media outlets serving as source for numerous articles in Wikipedia. We can't start judjing sources as unreliable based only on their political leanings.  

:ConJur is a [[WP:PARTISAN]] source. CartaCapital links are dead and together with CartaCampinas both are declared left-wing publication that doesn't meet [[WP:RS]] and [[WP:V]]. Rede Brasil Atual is a [[WP:QUESTIONABLE]] editoral.

:The controversy section ignores Moro's highly popular and praised merits and only focuses on leftist rhetoric. The Portuguese article don't even have those criticism.
::Sources present are major jornalistic ones, such as [[Folha de São Paulo]] and [[Universo Online]]. All other sources are also well accepted and are currently in use in other articles. And in the article in portuguese Wiki, actually, the "criticism section" is [[:pt:Sérgio Moro#Críticas|twice as big]]. So, this is neither here nor there.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s pronunciation of his own name ("Lyov" per Lectures on Russian Literature by [[Vladimir Nabokov]]) be included in the article in the lead or as a footnote? It's a very uncommon transliteration of the Russian name Lev, especially in connection to Tolstoy who has been widely known by the names Lev and Leo in Russia and worldwide, with few sources referring to him as "Lyov" as I showed on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Leo_Tolstoy#The_article_should_include_the_sourced_statement_that_Tolstoy_pronounced_his_first_name_as_%E2%80%98Lyov%E2%80%99 talk page]. The user who brought it up insists it should go in the lead even before the Lev name, while I agree to leave it as a footnote like in the [[:ru:Толстой, Лев Николаевич|Russian version of the article]], without additional changes to his birth/native name and further clarifications.

There is disagreement on whether [[:Category:American people with disabilities]], [[:Category:Artists with disabilities]], [[:Category:Disability media]] and [[:Category:Disability articles needing expert attention‏‎]] should be retained in this article. One view is that the categories should be retained because Jackson had [[vitiligo]]. The other view is that per [[WP:EGRS]], "which requires that categories about disability (and other personal features) only be applied when the subject has reliably and with some consistently been described as disabled and that the disability is in some way relevant to the person's notability," the categories don't belong. Also, [[:Category:Musicians with physical disabilities]] has been proposed as a replacement for the aforementioned categories. And, additionally, it has been noted that these categories are not in the [[Michael Jackson]] article, which is the main biography article.

There has been debate recently about which administrators should be included on school and school district articles. While [[WP:WPSCH/AG#WNTI]] indicates we should not be including anything other than the principal/head teacher, that is an essay as {{ping|Alansohn}} has noted. There was a discussion on this talk page on this subject above, but the respondents would have been only those interested in this project. I am therefore seeking wider input via this RfC. 

'''Question:''' Should school and school district articles include any administrators other than principal/head teacher/headmaster/superintendent even if we have one or more sources to support administrators below the top administrator?

'''Examples:''' '''(1)''' With only the principal; [[Dublin High School (California)]] and '''(2)''' With others below the principal; [[Bayonne High School]] (infobox and [[Bayonne_High_School#Administration]])

{{rfcquote|text=
There has been much debate about [[:File:Nelumbo Nucifera fruit - botanic garden Adelaide.jpg|this image]] (of a lotus seed pod) at the [[Trypophobia]] article. So far, the debate has produced [[Talk:Trypophobia/Archive 1#discussion|a 2013 RfC]], [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 122#Images on phobia articles|a 2015 Village pump (policy) discussion]], a [[Talk:Trypophobia/Archive 2#RfC Should we include this image?|2015 RfC here at this talk page]], and now this one. The first RfC closed as no consensus to remove the image, the second discussion did not have an official close, but more editors leaned toward excluding the image (and other phobia images in phobia articles), and the final RfC closed as consensus for including the image. The discussions have concerned whether or not including the image is beneficial to readers, and whether or not it causes unnecessary harm to our readers. One view has been that the image is educational because demonstrating what induces trypophobia is not easy since a simple explanation of "a fear of holes" or "irregular patterns or clusters of small holes, or bumps" does not suffice. People with trypophobia can look at holes or irregular patterns and not have a reaction. Rather, the condition is about certain patterns, and in particular images that present high-contrast energy at low and midrange spatial frequencies. Lotus seed pod imagery is commonly noted as imagery that induces trypophobia and is used by researchers to test for trypophobia. Another view is that the image is irrelevant, decorative, or not needed, and that, even if it is educational, it causes unnecessary harm to our readers; this is seen, for example, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trypophobia&diff=825431354&oldid=825177525 here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trypophobia&diff=853832257&oldid=851901689 here]. [[WP:NOTCENSORED]] has been cited in past discussions. Some have felt that removing the image based on the possibility that it might harm readers, especially if the condition is not real or an actual phobia, is censoring. Others have stated that this is not a matter of WP:NOTCENSORED; it's a matter of whether we really need the image for the topic and whether we want to risk causing our readers harm. The imagery won't harm those without trypophobia, but it will harm those with it (they are the ones most likely to visit this article) and, with more research on the topic having been done since past discussions, researchers are are clear that it exists and does induce negative psychological or autonomic nervous system responses. 

As a compromise, editors have suggested collapsing the image (although collapsing it has been noted as something that would cause accessibility issues), or moving the image far down the page. '''So should we remove the image? Retain the image in the lead, but collapse it? Or move it lower?'''

Should this page be renamed from "Tattoo medical issues" to "'''Medical issues of tattooing'''" or "'''Health effects of tattoos'''"?

The name as it stands seems to be "off" to me. It's hard to explain, but I guess I would say it violates wiki convention and doesn't make much grammatical/style sense. In one aspect, it's ''quick and to the point'' but in another it seems somehow ''undignified'' and ''simplistic''. I would also say that the current title is not exactly NPOV, given that no substantial health effects have ever been discovered from sterile and safe tattooing practices in modern tattoo parlors. (This is also a problem the article itself has as a whole, with focus on esoteric and rare complications as if they are common. I'm interested in revamping the article to reflect that, and will be doing so over the next few weeks.) Perhaps "Health effects of tattoos" would be more neutral and aesthetically pleasing. But what does everyone else think? Please add your votes and discussion below in bold like so:

Although a request for citation has been present since May 2017, there have been no citations added to support the claims that Mr James Karat "invented" STP. STP is a well known concept and not an invention created by a single person. It is simply the automation of business processes. There is no mention of what role Mr Karat played in the automation of the process - it appears he was working on an automation project anyway, so is it actually the case that he was the "jobber" and not a business process architect, system architect, system developer or any person who could have claim to "inventing" a concept. It appears that the entries have been made by Mr Karat himself and not someone independent. In fact in April 2016 the Edit History shows [[user:Graemeaustin|Graeme Austin]] commenting "Origination of phrase is in fact in dispute. James Karat may have been the first but I was deeply involved in STP in the early 90s in London and he is not known to me."

Should references to Mr Karat be removed?

Has the author violated WP protocols?
I have been accused of violating WP protocols in this and other articles.  I replaced an accurate article, violating WP: NPOV, NOR, SYN:NOR, UNDUE, OWN.  I welcome the opportunity to show why these charges are mistaken.  All of the elements of my case appear in the “Instrumentalism” lede, which now replaces my article in order to restore the status quo anti which I replaced in 2014.

The present lede defines instrumentalism as an “interpretation” or “theory” that “scientific theory is merely a tool” of prediction that says nothing about unobservable reality.  It claims this proposition was introduced by Duhem in 1906, and is the prevailing theory-of-theory in physics today.  It then states that instrumentalism is a form of anti-realism—the “demise” of which is claimed in the historical discussion that follows.  Thus INSTRUMENTALISM IS BOTH ALIVE AND DEAD—a paradox stated as a fact.  This characterization of instrumentalism in the original and present article is inaccurate, which explains my decision to replace.[[User:TBR-qed|TBR-qed]] ([[User talk:TBR-qed|talk]]) 14:42, 31 October 2018 (UTC)}}

Should we make this template hidden in the article mainspace with a code to those who doesn't logged in, especially readers? The articles that linked using this template are mostly only in the interest of the editors and often distract the readers who come here only to read (example: [[Fair use]], [[Internet troll]], [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]). We already put links to the project page at the left bar and from the Main Page. Some would probably argue that this hatnote would attract new editors, however that's not our purpose, our purpose is to create an encyclopedia. Per [[Wikipedia:Hatnote]]: "Their purpose is to help readers locate a different article if the one they are at is not the one they're looking for", most readers not even intended to look for the project namespace in the first place.

The links mentioned above and the "disputed" tag was removed from the article. They were removed with comments that the article does not discuss the party itself. While at the same time, the following citations were allowed to remain, which also do not discuss the party as such, but propose the opposite point of view than the ones that were being presented in the articles that were removed. The effect of removing the links mentioned above while allowing the links given below to remain, was that only a single point of view was allowed to express as a commentary on the political party while the opposing point of views were not allowed to be present.

Wikipedia policy on neutral point of view clearly states that if an opnion is stated in a news then it must be clarified in the encyclopedia entry that it is opinion of someone and not a fact

"Usually, articles will contain information about the significant opinions that have been expressed about their subjects. However, these opinions should not be stated in Wikipedia's voice"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view

The citations given are from websites with questionable integrity like infomoney.br, of whose charter and aims we know nothing about. Also the citations do not explain at all why the labelling of "far-right" has been done, it just uses it casually.

It is highly improper to use newspaper articles in this manner. News can be used as citation to say "event x occurred", but not as a conclusive evidence to say "x is a bad person" or "x is a far right" or "x is a far left". I disagree with this kind of biased approach and I request for comments.

I am going to propose that [[WP:U5]] gets extended to the draftspace. This is because the draftspace is being abused in a way that there are so many drafts being found daily which are basically [[WP:NOTWEBHOST]]. It is mainly point 5 of [[WP:NOTWEBHOST]] which I am seeing in loads of drafts. Rule 5 of [[WP:NOTWEBHOST]] is "Content for projects unrelated to Wikipedia. Do not store material unrelated to Wikipedia, including in userspace." and I am seeing that new users are using the draftspace in a way so that [[WP:U5]] can be escaped because [[WP:U5]] does not apply to the draftspace at the moment. If this is implemented, there will be less drafts coming to [[WP:MfD]] daily that could actually do with being speedily deleted per [[WP:U5]]. 

My new proposed wording for [[WP:U5]] is:

Pages in userspace or draftspace consisting of [[WP:NOTWEBHOST|writings, information, discussions, and/or activities not closely related to Wikipedia's goals]], where the owner has made few or no edits outside of [[Wikipedia:User pages|user pages]] and [[Wikipedia:Drafts|drafts]], with the exception of plausible drafts and pages adhering to [[Wikipedia:User pages#What may I have in my user pages?]].

[[WP:CSD#G6|Criterion G6]] is overloaded with many different things all lumped together as "uncontroversial maintenance" and is the most frequently abused of all criteria. It would never be approved if proposed as is today. The best way to solve this, in my opinion, is to unbundle the various different reasons into separate criteria that are individually objective. I'm not proposing to do this all at once, but to work on it step-by-step so that objections to one aspect don't derail the whole thing.

One aspect of G6 stands out as being a particularly poor fit with the rest: "Deleting redirects in the "File:" namespace with the same name as a file or redirect at Commons, provided the redirect on Wikipedia has no file links (unless the links are obviously intended for the file or redirect at Commons)." Accordingly I propose to move this criterion, without any changes, from G6 to a new R4 for these reasons:
*It deals only with redirects, and is thus where someone will look for it
*The general footer to the R criteria (don't speedy delete redirects with significant history, use RfD for redirects that don't meet the criteria) apply to these redirects equally with others
*It contains requirements that are significantly different to other things deleted using G6
*This isn't really "maintenance" in the same sense as other aspects of G6 (e.g. pages created in error/in the wrong place, etc)
*Deletion summaries will become more useful.
This does not change what can be speedy deleted, just under which criterion is gets speedy deleted. [[User:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] ([[User talk:Thryduulf|talk]]) 12:43, 5 November 2018 (UTC)}}

Background: There are no official reporting agencies for budget or gross figures in Indian cinema. News outlets must rely on their proprietary methods for estimating these values, and sometimes outlets' values conflict.

Some reliable sources, including Times of India[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/rajinikanth-and-akshay-kumars-2-0-times-when-the-film-made-headlines/rs-543-crore-spent-on-vfx-of-the-akshay-kumar-and-rajinikanth-starrer-2-0/photostory/65770317.cms] have estimated this film's budget at {{INR|link=yes}}543 [[crore]] ({{INR|link=yes}}5.43 billion). Another source generally considered reliable, Bollywood Hungama, has cast doubts on the high figures being reported, presenting a budget estimate of {{INR|link=yes}}400 crore ({{INR|link=yes}}4 billion).[https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/bollywood/revealed-real-budget-rajinikanth-akshay-kumar-starrer-2-0/]

Should we:
* Present the budget as {{INR}}543 crore?
* Present the budget as a range between {{INR}}400–543 crore?

Hi all, I noticed Siri Knowledge incorrectly listed TC as a Republican, went to edit on Wikipedia (where I think Siri Knowledge is sourced from) and actually no party was listed at all. Another user who seems to have an axe to grind is deleting this factual information because TC doesn't meet their standards of what they personally think a Democrat is. Not sure how to proceed with this, as when I have reverted unwarranted deletions like this in the past, I usually end up with warnings for 'edit warring' and whatnot. Could anyone advise as to how to proceed so that factual information can be reflected in this article? 

Just to clarify, TC is a Democrat. A user is arguing that it's 'extremely disingenuous'/'misleading' to then state in his bio that he is Democrat. I'm not sure I understand the argument - it seems counter-rational. But maybe someone can enlighten. [[User:Proustfala|Proustfala]] ([[User talk:Proustfala|talk]]) 18:34, 6 December 2018 (UTC)}}

At present, it is quite difficult to distinguish which results relate to which constructor due to there being merged cells for the constructor and points. Towards the beginning and end of the seasons this is less of an issue but during the majority of the season I find myself having to count the number of cells in order to see what result was for each team.

{{rfcquote|text=
I'm inviting you to participate in the resolution of one of the most long term discussions on Wikipedia. 

Normally, an RfC wouldn't be needed for such a simple edit, but for anyone who's familiar with this article, it's known how hard this topic is. The lack of sources led to more than a decade of pointless discussions. 

The purpose of this RfC is not to change the current consensus or the article text, but to put a further context to the current consensus. After several years since the current consensus was established, readers were constantly confused by the article text, which led to numerous change requests. Since then, one editor made a good research and found a source which settles the whole debate. 

This source gives the exact definition of Tesla's birthplace. It is backed up by a primary source, thus making it the most strongest source on the matter.

The source gives this definition of Tesla's birthplace:

"After many pleas from Jelecic, in 1850 the King's proclamation, which was signed by all 8 Austrian ministers, was finally announced...For Military Frontier, the King decided that it will remain within its present territory. However, it will with, Croatia and Slavonia, constitute a single land with disaggregated provincial and military administration, and representation." , page 157. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/najnovijedobahrv00horv|title=Najnovije doba hrvatske povjesti|first=Rudolf|last=Horvat|date=8 December 2018|publisher=U Zagrebu Matica hrvatska|accessdate=8 December 2018|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

There are two parts of this RfC. 

1.Rfc suggestion.
The purposed change is to add the mentioned source as a reference to this sentence:
Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village Smiljan, Lika county, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia), on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856.[12][13]
{{reflist-talk}}

2.RfC question

Was Nikola Tesla born in a single Austrian land composed of Military Frontier, Croatia and Slavonia per provided source.

I'm a bit irritated by the inconsistency in how Northern Irish people are categorized on Wikipedia. Looking at [[:Category:DJs by nationality]], all of the DJs by nationality are categorized by the adjective form (e.g. "American DJs", "Russian DJs", "British DJs", even "[[:Category:Welsh DJs|Welsh DJs]]" and "[[:Category:Scottish DJs|Scottish DJs]]") '''but not Northern Irish DJs''' who are categorized as "[[:Category:DJs from Northern Ireland|DJs from Northern Ireland‎]]". I don't like this at all! I once started a CfD to change the DJs category but it was opposed on the basis that all the other Northern Irish people categories use the "xxx from Northern Ireland" form. So I'm proposing to change it on a wider scale, changing all category instances of "xxx from Northern Ireland" to "Northern Irish xxx" for consistency with the other similar categories of different countries. <u style="font:1.1em/1em Arial Black">[[User:Flooded with them hundreds|<u style="color:#7f2ed1">Flooded </u>]]<u style="color:#bfa6d8"><small>with them </small></u>[[User_talk:Flooded with them hundreds|<u style="color:#7f2ed1">'''hundreds'''</u>]]</u> 13:47, 13 November 2018 (UTC)}}

As this discussion is rapidly spinning out of control (witness multiple sections being opened on the same topic and attempts to centralize the discussion being reverted), it appears a more formal (and widely publicized) solution is in order.

The question is: 

'''What if anything should we include at this time on the "Nazi salute controversy"?'''

It's also fairly clear we have four choices:
#Some variation (subject to discussion on the finer points) of what existed [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baraboo_High_School&diff=prev&oldid=868681256 here].
#Nothing.
#Nothing for now, revisiting in say three months so we can accurately gauge the enduring nature of this information.
#A brief discussion of the school itself's role in this.

Please indicate your preferences in order from the one that most suits your position to the least suitable, along with your arguments.

 Should tone marks be used in Wade-Giles transliterations? Is it ''Wei<sup>1</sup> Chai<sup>2</sup> Shih<sup>4</sup> P&#x2bb;in<sup>1</sup>-yin<sup>1</sup>'' or ''Wei Chai Shih Pʻin-yin''?

'''TLDR''': You’d be hard pressed to find anyone other than Wikipedia who transliterates Chinese with Wade-Giles tone marks. I searched for ''Mao² Tsê²-tung¹'' on Gbooks and went away empty handed.

Until the early 1980s, Wade-Giles was that standard way to transliterate Chinese characters. It was popularized by ''[http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CADAL/B33646119/ A Chinese-English Dictionary]''  (1912) by [[Herbert Giles]]. The entry titles in Giles’ dictionary are all-caps and without tone marks: “HUANG.” The idea that the system includes tones marks does not come from the dictionary itself, but rather from usage by Giles in the preface and supplementary tables of his dictionary.

The name "Wade-Giles system" is intended to suggest "Wade's system as implemented in Giles dictionary." But in fact the system is usually understood to encompass implementations by ''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary|Mathew's Dictionary]]'' (1943) and others. It is not the property of Herbert Giles. ''[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Wade-Giles-romanization#accordion-article-history Encyclopedia Britannica]''`s article on the system includes an extensive list of examples, none of them with tone marks. The multivolume reference work ''[[Cambridge History of China]]'' is one of the few places where the contemporary reader might encounter Wade-Giles in the wild, so to speak. The CHC implementation does not include tone marks. [[User:FineStructure137|FineStructure137]] ([[User talk:FineStructure137|talk]]) 14:01, 14 November 2018 (UTC)}}

Yeah, I know, [[WP:PERENNIAL]]. But after yet another compromised inactive admin account ran amok over the project today, I feel like this should be revisited. The account in question did not have a logged action in over 2 years, and had made only 5 edits in 2017 and one in 2018. The policy [[Special:Permalink/866740594#Procedural removal for inactive administrators|as currently worded]] reads:

{{quotebox|Administrators who have made neither edits nor administrative actions for at least 12 months may be desysopped.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/suspend sysop rights of inactive admins]], June 2011</ref> Subject to the [[#Lengthy inactivity|lengthy inactivity]] consideration below, this desysopping is not to be considered permanent, or a reflection on the user's use of, or rights to, the admin tools. The admin must be contacted on their user talk page and via e-mail (if possible) one month before the request for desysopping and again several days before the desysopping goes into effect. Desysopping on inactivity grounds should be handled by English Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|bureaucrats]]. The summary in the user rights log should make it clear that the desysopping is purely procedural.}}

I propose modifying this to:

{{quotebox|Administrators who have made no logged administrative actions for at least 12 months may be desysopped.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/suspend sysop rights of inactive admins]], June 2011</ref> Subject to the [[#Lengthy inactivity|lengthy inactivity]] consideration below, this desysopping is not to be considered permanent, or a reflection on the user's use of, or rights to, the admin tools. Desysopping on inactivity grounds should be handled by English Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|bureaucrats]]. The summary in the user rights log should make it clear that the desysopping is purely procedural.}}

{{reflist-talk}}

The change removes the notification requirement, and the "edits" criterion. The effect is that admin accounts which don't use admin tools for 12 months will simply have the bit silently removed as a matter of security. We won't tell them we're about to do it, and then they won't log in and make one nonsense edit to hang on to the bit. Removal will just happen when they've been away long enough, and if they come back some time later and want to go back to adminning they just ask at BN and go through the 24-hour hold like anyone else whose bit has been voluntarily removed. In fact admins should be ''actively discouraged'' from "holding on to the bit" in this manner, but let's at least do this.

Why not rename this to "Articles for Discussion", and then fold [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]], all of the {{tl|Merge}} stuff, all of the {{tl|Split}} stuff, and possibly [[WP:DRAFTIFY]] into one AFD process? I'm sure that there are one or two other process that could easily fit under an "articles for discussion" umbrella, as well. De-emphasizing deletion as the primary mechanism, even if it is only a "psychological" de-emphasis, certainly couldn't hurt anything though. Most importantly however, simplifying and centralizing 4-5 different processes into a single discussion forum could only help all of us as editors, I would think.

As a prelude to taking this to formal arbitration a discussion on the talk page is usually required - this is it.

User:Cagwinn has on this page, and a number of others, repeatedly placed his personal opinion above that of the relevant scholarship, usually making some plea that certain relevant and entirely reputable books or papers are inadmissible as they are not written by philologists, even though the linguistic point at dispute has direct historical implications, and common sense would imply that scholarly historical references would be entirely appropriate.

In the case of this article, which contains very few citations, he has removed material which is multiply cited to reputable scholarly material. He does not refute the the existence of the scholarly material used, he does not offer alternative views supported by more compelling scholarly citations, he does not choose to add an opposing viewpoint to stand alongside the existing material. No, what he does is remove existing fully referenced material, citing no scholarly material as support for this, merely his own views on the subject. This is own research in its most overt form, and is blatant point of view peddling. Both being entirely antithetical to the spirit and the rules of editing Wikipedia articles.

Currently, the scope of the move review process is limited to reviewing whether [[WP:RM|requested move]] discussions have been properly closed and executed. The results of discussions that take place as part of the processes called '[[WP:CFD|categories for discussion]]' and '[[WP:RFD|redirects for discussion]]' have in the past been reviewed at [[WP:DRV|deletion review]], even when the relevant discussions did not involve deletion. The awkwardness of this situation has recently become an issue, and so I've opened this RfC. Should the purview of the move review process formally be expanded to include reviews of the closing of renaming discussions that take place at [[WP:CfD]] and [[WP:RfD]], and should the MR, CfD, and RfD pages be updated to clarify the review process for discussions that take part as part of those processes to that effect?

I have been drawn to this question by [[User:יניב הורון|יניב הורון (Yaniv)]].

The history section is currently 39 paragraphs long, and >100kb in size (about 1/3 of the entire article). It is haphazard in the weight it puts against each of the periods of the region's history (a good visual overview is below). Some examples: we have just two paragraphs on the entire first millenium AD (i.e. from 0AD to 1099AD, including just a single sentence on the development of Christianity in the region), just one sentence on the entire Ottoman period, and just two paragraphs on the mandate period.

{{Timeline of Palestine Sovereign Powers}}

So I have two questions for the community:
# How much weight should the history section of this article have? Is 39 paragraphs '''too much''', '''too little''', or '''about right'''?
# What is a fair and objective way for '''deciding the due weight''' for each time period?

I would like to propose that we delete [[:Category:Articles created via the Article Wizard]] because this is useless tracking and it already has over 40,000 pages which don't need to be tracked. ArticleWizard is the process that many new editors use to create new articles or new drafts for articles and it is pointless to track this. Two years ago, [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Categories_for_discussion/2016/08/Category:Uploaded_with_UploadWizard Commons got rid of a similar category that tracked images uploaded with UploadWizard]. It is just useless to track pages created with the ArticleWizard. I recently got rid of [[:Category:Unreviewed new articles created via the Article Wizard]] over two weeks ago and that was useless tracking as well. There was a CfD at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2014 February 4#Category:Articles_created_via_the_Article_Wizard]] over four and half years ago and at that time, AfC wasn't that stabilised but now it is. There are over 40,000 pages which don't need to be tracked with this category and 109 useless monthly subcategories of this category that are being tracked at [[:Category:Userspace drafts created via the Article Wizard]] that don't need to be tracked. A lot has change in the last four and a half years and [[:Category:Articles created via the Article Wizard]] as well as [[:Category:Userspace drafts created via the Article Wizard]] is at a very unmanageable size. We don't need tracking for every single page that is created through the ArticleWizard and that category is just indefinitely growing.

The use of [https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/ sciencebasedmedicine.org] (hereafter referred to as SBM) as a source has been discussed in various contexts[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard#Science-based_medicine_as_a_source_for_negative_BLP_content][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Biographies_of_living_persons/Archive_44#RfC:_The_intersection_of_BLPSPS_and_PSCI_restated][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_247#sciencebasedmedicine.org][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_202#Harriet_A._Hall_criticizing_Michael_Greger][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michael_Greger/Archive_2#Request_for_comments_on_SBM_source][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_141#Film_review_by_David_Gorski_at_ScienceBasedMedicine.org_of_Gabriel_Cousens_documentary_Simply_Raw][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_187#Neuromuscular_scientist's_blog_as_an_RS_on_religious_practices_-_Reiki_as_pseudoscience] but if/when it may be used as a source is still debated, a particular point of contention is whether SBM is a [[WP:SPS|self published source]]. Note that under wikipedia policy self published sources (SPS) and reliable sources (RS) are not mutually exclusive, SPS may be considered reliable if published by an expert in the field being discussed, but regardless of expertise SPS may '''never''' be used as a source for statements about living persons (other than the author of the SPS), see [[WP:BLPSPS]]. 

So the questions are: Is SBM reliable as a source? And are articles on SBM never, sometimes or always self published sources? Note that this RfC is NOT about whether to change any policies, only about when(if ever), under current policy, SBM can be used as a source.

Right now, {{noping|Citation bot}} removes publisher and location in {{tl|cite journal}}. Proponents of this removal state that this is recommended by nearly every style guide under the belief that there is little value to the information. 

However:

* Several recent threads at [[User talk:Citation bot]] indicate that removing the parameters is unexpected at-best and believed to be detrimental at worst;
* "nearly every style guide" is not [[WP:MOS|our style guide]]
* Removing them does not respect the consensus in [[Module:Citation/CS1]], which is to provide the parameters in cite journal.

This RFC seeks [[WP:CCC|consensus]] for the following questions:

# Should Citation bot continue to remove these data?
# Is there consensus for this removal, {{em|anywhere}}, by {{em|anyone}}?
# Should we continue to support these parameters in [[Module:Citation/CS1]] for {{tl|cite journal}}? <s>If we continue to support these parameters, should we:</s>

From the template documentation:

<code>seats_before1 ... The seat count before the election, labeled 'current seats' if the election is yet to take place.</code>

<code>seat_change1 ... The change in the number of seats won at the election compared to the previous election.</code>

'''Questions:'''
# Does a vacant seat count as a "seat before" for a party? What if it is in a district that is considered safe? What if RSes generally count a vacant seat as a "party's seat"?
# Should "seat change" be calculated from "last election" or "seats before"? 
# Should "the rules" be the same for all articles, or should there be exceptions for certain elections (based on nation, or type, etc.)? One size fits all?

''Example 1:'' Party A has 100 members in "last election." Two retire, leaving 98 "seats before." In the election, the two seats are filled by Party A candidates, leaving 100 "seats after." Is Party A's "seat change" +2 (from "seats before") or 0 (from "last election")?

''Example 2:'' "Last election" is Party A 100, Party B 100. Two As retire, leaving 98 A / 100 B. In a special election to fill one of those vacancies, Party B wins, "flipping the seat," leaving 98 A / 101 B as "seats before." On Election Day, Party A wins 99 seats, Party B wins 101 seats ("seats after"). Is Party A's "seat change" +1 (99 "seats after" - 98 "seats before") or -1 (100 "last election" - 99 "seats after")?

''Example 3:'' "Last election" is 100 A / 100 B. Each party has two vacancies, leaving 98 A / 98 B. One of the A seats is won by a B candidate in a special election, leaving 98 A / 99 B "seats before." On Election Day, one of the B vacancies flips to A, leaving 100 A / 100 B "seats after." Is "seat change" +2 A, +1 B (98->100, 99->100, from "seats before"), meaning both parties made gains in the election, or is "seat change" 0 A, 0 B (100->100 for both from "last election")?

Is it an {{s|"open election" or}} an "open seat" if an incumbent runs in an early round of the election (''e.g.'' a primary), but no incumbent runs in the final round (''e.g.'' a general election)? For example, if an incumbent runs and loses in a primary, or withdraws after a primary, and there is no incumbent in the general election, is that an "open" election or an "open" seat?) What if the final round has no opponent (as in the case of MA-7 in the recent US House elections)? [[User:Levivich|Levivich]] ([[User talk:Levivich|talk]]) 00:08, 30 November 2018 (UTC)}}
