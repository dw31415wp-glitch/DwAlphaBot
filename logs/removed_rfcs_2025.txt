Should [[Wikipedia:Administrators#Restoration of admin tools]] be amended to:
* '''Option 1'''{{snd}}Require former administrators to request restoration of their tools at the [[WP:BN|bureaucrats' noticeboard]] (BN) if they are eligible to do so (i.e., they do not fit into any of the exceptions).
* '''Option 2'''{{snd}}<s>Clarify</s> <ins>Maintain the status quo</ins> that former administrators who would be eligible to request restoration via BN may instead request restoration of their tools via a voluntary [[WP:RfA|request for adminship]] (RfA).
* '''Option 3'''{{snd}}Allow bureaucrats to SNOW-close RfAs as successful if (a) 48 hours have passed, (b) the editor has right of resysop, and (c) a SNOW close is warranted.

'''Background''': This issue arose in one [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Worm That Turned 2|recent RfA]] and is currently being discussed in an [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Hog Farm 2|ongoing RfA]].

{{rfcquote|text=
Which, if any, subsections of [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the Birmingham Metropolitan Area, West Midlands#Approved, proposed and emergent]] should be deleted? Should buildings in these sections with and without Wikipedia articles be treated differently? In favor of deletion is an interpretation of [[WP:CRYSTAL]] which says uncertain future events like building construction are out of scope for Wikipedia, especially for emergent proposals, which have not yet sought planning approval and it's unclear have a 50% probability of actually happening due to government rejection or financial difficulties. Against deletion is the argument that it's useful for research purposes to document the proposals and even though the proposals might not get built, they are referenced to reliable sources; approved designs are specific and more likely to get built. After this RFC is complete, the article may be split due to size, depending on what is kept. -- [[User:Beland|Beland]] ([[User talk:Beland|talk]]) 01:45, 4 December 2024 (UTC)}}

Should the following revision/expansion be accepted or rejected?

It concerns the paragraph introducing the quoted excerpt in the section currently titled [[Court of the Lions#Excerpt of Ibn Zamrak's poem on the basin|"Excerpt of Ibn Zamrak's poem on the basin"]] (about an inscription carved into the courtyard's fountain). It currently reads as:
{{blockquote|''The poet and minister [[Ibn Zamrak]] wrote a poem to describe the beauty of the courtyard. It also describes the fountain's hydraulic system.{{sfn|Irwin|2004|p=52}}{{sfn|López|2011|p=134}} It is carved around the rim of the basin:{{Sfn|Puerta Vílchez|2015|p=169}}''}}

The proposed expansion would read as:
{{blockquote|''Carved around the rim of the basin is a poem of twelve verses by the vizier and poet [[Ibn Zamrak]]. Six of the verses originate, with minor modifications, from a longer ''[[qasida]]'' of 146 verses that Ibn Zamrak composed for the banquet honoring the circumcision of Muhammad V's son, Abd Allah.{{Sfn|Puerta Vílchez|2015|p=168}} Verses from the same ''qasida'' are also included in the Hall of the Two Sisters.{{Sfn|Puerta Vílchez|2015|p=168}} The first part of the poem refers specifically to the fountain{{Sfn|Puerta Vílchez|2015|p=169}} and alludes to how its hydraulic system functioned.{{sfn|Irwin|2004|p=52}}{{sfn|López|2011|p=134}} Below is an excerpt (verses 3 to 7):{{Sfn|Puerta Vílchez|2015|p=169}}''}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Should we have notability standards for individual tornado articles? We already have informal inclusion criteria for "Tornadoes of YYYY" articles. Below is a preliminary proposal for such criteria, with the hope that it can evolve into a formal guideline that can possibly be referenced in future AfD discussions.

[[File:Symbol recycling vote.svg|20px|alt=recycle]] '''Previous discussions:''' [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Weather/Archive 5#New tornado articles and the news|New tornado articles and the news]], [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Weather/Archive 4#Proposal - Criteria for inclusion on Tornadoes of XXXX articles|Proposal - Criteria for inclusion on Tornadoes of XXXX articles]]

This has been nagging at me for a while now, and since another editor has talked to me about this issue, I think we bring this up. Since we have a sort of "inclusion criteria" for "Tornadoes of YYYY" articles, I suggest we come up with notability criteria for individual tornadoes as well. See [[User:EF5/My tornado criteria]] for what this may look like.


This is my very primitive way of determining the notability of several tornado articles I've written, and am hoping that it could be integrated into a refined set-in-stone WPW policy that could be used in actual AfDs. I'd assume that the table will be gotten rid of and turned into a list. This has been discussed in the past, but never really came to anything. Maybe it could be... [[WP:NTORNADO]] (with it's own project page)? Starting an RfC, since obviously community input is needed. Also pinging {{ping|Departure–}}, who suggested this. :) [[User:EF5|<span style="color:#A188FC;">'''E'''</span>]]<sub>[[User talk:EF5|<span style="color:#A188FC;">'''F'''</span>]]</sub><sup>[[User:EF5/Creations|<span style="color:#A188FC;">'''5'''</span>]]</sup> 18:56, 16 December 2024 (UTC)}}

Should a globally visible RfC be required to make changes to the list of Level 3 Vital articles?

''' RfC discussion '''

* '''Require RfC'''{{snd}}to be blunt, I'm a bit concerned by the potential for counterproductive changes resulting from restless tinkering based on particularized interpretations of what the VA system is for and basic misreadings of its guidelines. This list has been fairly stable over the years, and while mere longevity is usually weak consensus, for a system whose results are so widely visible to editors it is distinctly less so. I think there is far more likelihood with the present system for a weak consensus localized here to do damage than to make efficient improvements to the list of what we consider the 1000 most vital articles, meant to stably guide the work of editors. At present, the overwhelming majority of proposals are not approved. Even though a supermajority is required for approval, the low turnout puts a considerable onus on individual editors to keep noticing and opposing clearly defective or lazy proposals, which is a waste of time. <span style="border-radius:2px;padding:3px;background:#1E816F">[[User:Remsense|<span style="color:#fff">'''Remsense'''</span>]]<span style="color:#fff">&nbsp;‥&nbsp;</span>[[User talk:Remsense|<span lang="zh" style="color:#fff">'''论'''</span>]]</span> 04:26, 10 January 2025 (UTC)}}

''Due to his considerable influence over American government policy, politics, media, industry, and public discourse, some academics and politicians have characterized Musk as an American oligarch.[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/paul-krugman-elon-musk-sam-bankman-fried-oligarchs-twitter-ftx-2022-12][https://www.barrons.com/news/twitter-names-elon-musk-to-board-further-lifting-shares-01649176807][https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4960488-fiona-hill-musk-trump-profits-power/][https://www.barrons.com/news/twitter-names-elon-musk-to-board-further-lifting-shares-01649176807][https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/12/elon-musk-x-congress-shutown/681120/][https://slate.com/business/2024/11/donald-trump-election-elon-musk-bill-gates-american-oligarcy-wealthy-donors-politics.html][https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-issues-oligarchy-warning-about-elon-musk-2004263]''

Does this addition have any support? Are there any other suggestions? (Some editors have argued that Musk should directly be referred to as an oligarch in the lead. I now agree with those that oppose doing so per [[WP:UNDUE]].)

{{rfcquote|text=
hey so this shouldn't even be an RfC, sorry for wasting your time, but I've been arguing with this one editor, so if you're not busy, well this editor wants "'''Jackson's legacy is controversial. He has been praised as an advocate for working Americans and preserving the union of states, and criticized for his racist policies, particularly towards Native Americans.'''" And I'm just confused because no other politician, no other president of the United States of America or any other country has public opinion of them on the very first paragraph of their article. Yeah he was racist, most early presidents were, he lived hundreds of years ago lol. George Washington was a slave owner, gonna mention he was racist in the first paragraph of his article? No. Some argue he's more controversial so that's why his page is like that. Hitler is controversial. His article doesn't say "He is viewed negatively because he killed 6 million Jews" it just says "he killed six million jews." Even though I disagree, we can still add he was racist, I just wanna remove "His legacy is controversial for being racist" and "he was praised" because public opinion is more about people's views on the president than the president himself. And both separate additions of this article probably count as biased editing. [[User:DisneyGuy744|DisneyGuy744]] ([[User talk:DisneyGuy744|talk]]) 20:14, 25 January 2025 (UTC)}}

(The word dictator been been removed for now while the RfC discussion takes place)

Should Sisi be referred to as a dictator? Some of these options are not mutually exclusive, so more than one can be selected:
*'''A.''' Yes he should be, in a similar way as described above or found in the the leads of [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]], [[Kim Jong Un]], [[Hafez al Assad]], [[Pinochet]]
*'''B.''' No he should not be, but he should be described as an authoritarian ruler, leader of an authoritarian regime, or leader of a military dictatorship somewhere in the lead, similar to the leads of [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]], [[Mohammed bin Salman]], [[Ilham Aliyev]], [[Isaias Afwerki]]
*'''C.''' No he should not be, but some variation of "Many observers see Sisi as a dictator" should be included in the lead.
*'''D. ''' No he should not be, and he should '''not''' be described as an authoritarian ruler. Instead, different arguments regarding his form of rule should be summarized in the body.
*'''E.''' Other (please elaborate)

It's been three years since the [[Talk:Imelda Marcos/Archive 4#Photo|last discussion was held]] in regards to the infobox image. As I believed so back then, the current image (which was reached by consensus albeit) is unflattering and as one user noted above, it's a bit creepy. I created a [[:File:Imelda Romualdez Marcos 2 (cropped).jpg|cropped close up]] so you can see what I'm talking about. Her eyes are half-open, quality isn't the best and if this is truly the 'best' picture that captures what she's known for (as stated in the last discussion three years ago in terms of her outfits), then perhaps it's best to asses an infobox image based on quality over what she's 'known' for. If this is the best picture that shows her during her 'comeback' (as stated in last discussion), then once again, I must emphasize the quality of the picture (awkward lighting, unflattering eye pose, not the best in quality). These are the current images at commons that are best suited for an infobox image. As noted in other talk page discussions, when the subject of an article passes away, their infobox image is also replaced with a black and white picture ''or'' of one that captures them in their 'prime' so to speak. Although (as of now) Marcos is still alive, I feel that Option B is in better quality than the current picture, shows her as her time as First Lady (much like other first lady articles) and will depict her in her prime when she passes away (not a huge factor now, but worth thinking about).

* RFC Text:

Imagine a Wiki article on a previously well known restaurant. The article can cite reliable sources in the culinary media about the restaurant and its Chef Owner and the food as it enjoyed a period of time in the spotlight. Like many restaurants, that time long since elapsed but the positive coverage can still be located in the archives of reliable sources.

Then, some time after that initial coverage faded, the chef/owner took a strange turn. He started crafting and serving food that nearly every diner considers vile. In fact, he crafts it out of human waste and now cultivates a much smaller clientele of people who enjoy consuming human waste. The restaurant that garnered positive press arguably no longer exists.

But we have a problem. Since the reliable media no longer covers this restaurant, there are no reliable sources that can be used to update the Wikipedia article. A few food bloggers have commented but despite their popularity and reputation among diners, they do not meet Wikipedia's reliability standards. The obvious answer is to delete the article as it is now entirely an inaccurate portrayal of the restaurant. But now the policy about deletion slams down and says no because the restaurant was once notable. So the article stays.

And the closed loop of Wikipedia policies leaves an an absurd situation completely unresolvable. Wikipedia is hosting an article that is hopelessly outdated and completely inaccurate. A diner seeking out a reservation is in for a horrendous experience, but Wikipedia can do nothing about this because these policies in tandem REQUIRE the encyclopedia to host an inaccurate article.

That's the situation with Sinfest. I don't dispute that the interpretations of policy is accurate, but the resulting situation is absurd and leaves an ENCYCLOPEDIA hosting an article that is at best incomplete and at worse completely inaccurate with no recourse. This is a perfect test case for the need to change this platform to keep up with the rapidly shifting nature of attention in today's media economy.  
:In my mind, if the article cannot be updated to reflect the current status of what it is describing due to a lack of reliable sources describing precisely how it has drastically changed, then allowing the article to remain up does the average reader a disservice and it could be argued that the article's subject is no longer noteworthy enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia. It is better to have no article than a woefully outdated, misleading one. Contrary to what others have said, things are not necessarily permanently notable, particularly given the ephemeral nature of the internet.--[[User:Rosicrucian|Rosicrucian]][[User Talk:Rosicrucian|<sup>Talk</sup>]] 22:29, 27 January 2025 (UTC)}}

If other editors want to suggest their own images, they are more than welcome to.

I would like to start a [[WP:RFC|request for comment]] on the usage of a "closing songs" table in this article.

I originally [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australia%27s_Funniest_Home_Videos&diff=prev&oldid=1266133774 removed the table] on 30 December for several reasons, which I will go into detail about below. It was then [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australia%27s_Funniest_Home_Videos&diff=prev&oldid=1266555690 reinstated] on 1 January by who I believe is a sockpuppet of a long-term vandal on Wikipedia (I go into more detail about this vandal below). I then [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australia%27s_Funniest_Home_Videos&diff=next&oldid=1266555745 removed it again], mostly because of the Wikipedia guideline that states that [[WP:BANREVERT|edits from banned and blocked users can be reverted for any reason]], but also because the IP user failed to give a reason why it should be kept. It was then reinstated today on 2 January by user {{user|NickHrvo}}. 

In order to not prolong an edit war and to prevent any violations of our [[Wikipedia:3RR|three revert rule]], I have decided to start this RfC. 

There are a few reasons as to why I believe this table should be removed:
* It is largely unsourced, and likely to not be sourced in the future, due to the nature of the table. In particular, any sources would likely be the show itself. The show itself is a [[WP:PRIMARY|primary source]], which are largely discouraged from use on Wikipedia.
* The unsourced nature of the table serves as an opening for [[WP:HOAX|hoaxes]] and [[WP:Vandalism|vandalism]]. In particular, this table is frequently edited by the [[WP:LTA/TFD|Teenage Fairytale Dropouts vandal]], who is a long-term vandal of Wikipedia. They add songs to this table that are either hoaxes or difficult to verify.
* It is overly detailed and contains information likely to only be relevant to fans of this show. On Wikipedia, this information is called [[WP:FANCRUFT|fancruft]]. A list of "closing songs" is simply unnecessary for the purpose of Wikipedia, which is to provide general information about many topics (including this show).

I will notify a few WikiProjects, along with NickHrvo, about this discussion so that they can participate if they so wish, and especially so NickHrvo can provide why he believes the table should be kept.

There have been several discussions opened in the past regarding this article's content and overall scope. Several wars have a list of military engagements and battles. Examples include: [[List of military engagements of World War I|World War I ("Military engagements")]], [[List of World War II battles|World War II ("Battles")]], [[List of military engagements during the Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of Ukraine ("Military engagements")]], [[List of engagements during the Sudanese civil war (2023–present)|Sudanese civil war ("Engagements")]].

The [[Israel–Hamas war]] is no different with this article. However, unlike all the other list of military engagement articles, this article has a ton of clean-up templates including lack of sourcing, MOS, and scope issues.

So, with all that background, let's have a discussion on what the '''''scope''''' of this article should include, or more specifically, '''what is a "[[Engagement (military)|military engagement]]" during the Israel-Hamas war?''' Are ''"Battle of ...."'' engagements? Are airstrikes engagements? Should the article's scope be redefined away from "military engagements" to just "engagements"? Ect...

[[Encyclopaedia Metallum]]: The Metal Archives is user-generated content. There is long-standing consensus [[Talk:Encyclopaedia_Metallum#Source|since 2007]], and [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Albums/Archive_52#Genres_and_User-Contributed_Sources|affirmed in 2015]], that Encyclopaedia Metallum/Metal Archives is thus unreliable. It nonetheless constantly gets added as a source, including for highly contentions BLP statements (such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Socialist_black_metal&diff=1273705189&oldid=1262848697 this edit] to - redundantly - verify a band playing [[National Socialist black metal]]). It is sometimes used as an external link, which generally, as far as I understand, possibly acceptable, although other databases - Spirit of Metal, [[Discogs]], etc. - often contain similar information. Also, if you run a search for uses of the site, it also is listed on numerous album cover images as the source for fair use. That is incorrect copyright attribution and technically a copyright violation (the original publisher or media itself should be listed). Essentially, nearly every single instance of this source across thousands of pages is in violation of either consensus against user-generated content or else technically commits a copy-right violation. I've tried to clean this up on some articles, but there's thousands. Over at the spam blacklist proposals page, one editor said that that venue isn't sufficient to blacklist a source used on that many pages, while another editor pointed out the copyright violation issue and said that would be a reason for blacklisting. I'm hoping a stronger consensus can emerge here as to whether or not the source should be deprecated, or even blacklisted.--[[User:3family6|3family6]] ([[User talk:3family6|Talk to me]]<nowiki>|</nowiki>[[Special:Contributions/3family6|See what I have done]]) 15:13, 4 February 2025 (UTC)}}

The current single sentence on Gaza in the lede is as follows: {{green|During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden condemned the actions of Hamas as terrorism and sent military aid to Israel, as well as humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.}} The sentence is regularly modified, including the word "limited" which keeps being added/removed in front of "humanitarian aid". I started [[Talk:Joe Biden/Archive 19#"Announced military support for Israel" in the lede|a discussion]] on this topic a while ago; it didn't get a lot of input and didn't lead to a consensus. I thought this RfC could generate a larger discussion and settle a few related questions at once:
* Should the "military aid" and "humanitarian aid" be mentioned side by side as is?
* Should we mention that the amount of military aid sent to Israel is [https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-us-military-spending-8e6e5033f7a1334bf6e35f86e7040e14 a historical record]?
* Next to the mention of military aid, should there be a mention of allegations of war crimes against Israel?
Feel free to expand the discussion to other questions. My hope is that we can workshop a sentence that has a consensus behind it. Thanks! [[User:WikiFouf|WikiFouf]] ([[User talk:WikiFouf|talk]]) 13:58, 11 January 2025 (UTC)}}

Disputed revision [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salome_Zourabichvili&diff=prev&oldid=1275148115]]

I edited the article today because the description of Salome Zourabichvili as the incumbent president is '''misleading'''. Although there is no doubt that Georgia is mired in a [[2024–2025 Georgian constitutional crisis|political crisis]], there is no consensus that this crisis is "constitutional" (see [[Talk:2024–2025 Georgian constitutional crisis#Requested move 5 January 2025]]). Although, Zourabichvili refused to accept the official outcome of the parliamentary elections and the subsequent appointment of her successor, she voluntarily vacated the presidential palace on 29 December 2024. In doing so, she acknowledged that, according to both the constitutional provisions and the established practices of Georgian institutions, '''her term had ended'''. (Had she remained in the palace, it would have sparked a genuine constitutional crisis.) 

[[Mikheil Kavelashvili]], elected on 14 December and inaugurated on 29 December 2024 is the recognised head of state by '''all formal Georgian institutions'''. To claim otherwise is POV. Even though Zourabichvili herself, many opposition figures, some Western countries, and parts of civil society continue to contest his legitimacy, from a constitutional standpoint the dispute is '''purely political''' and reflects differences of opinion over the electoral process rather than an actual constitutional impasse.

To put this into perspective, if every allegation of electoral fraud were to trigger a "constitutional crisis", then virtually every country (especially those with authoritarian tendencies where disputes over election results are common) would be per this article standard in a perpetual state of constitutional crisis/disputes. Constitutional law requires a separation between legal procedure and political disagreement and the distinction between political and constitutional dispute must be clear. In Georgia's case, the constitutional framework itself clearly stipulates that the president is elected indirectly. The election [[2024 Georgian presidential election|was held]] and was '''not challenged by the Constitutional Court'''. 

In conclusion; The characterisation of this dispute as constitutional rather than political misrepresents the state of affairs in Georgia, where, despite political contestation, the constitutional procedures have been followed, and all institutions now formally recognise a new president. While Zourabichvili and her supporters continue to maintain an alternative narrative, according to the Georgian Constitution and the formal decisions of Georgian institutions, she neither de jure nor de facto holds the presidency.

I therefore propose to keep my revision, which clearly states that Zourabichvili's mandate has ended, with an added note explaining the context (the political dispute and the crisis in Georgia). 

(By the way, this is not the only article about Georgia that is subject to POV dispute.) [[User:Tahomaru|Tahomaru]] ([[User talk:Tahomaru|talk]]) 14:15, 11 February 2025 (UTC)}}

As far as I know, English Wikipedia is the only wiki with its own usurpation page, while all other wikis process such requests on Meta. While requests on Meta are typically handled within hours, those on English Wikipedia often face delays due to a lack of attention from renamers.

See previous discussion [[Talk:Casualties of the Gaza war#Definition of Children|here]], and  [[Talk:Casualties of the Gaza war#A proposal relating to the definition of Children|here]]. Pinging: @[[User:NadVolum|NadVolum]], and ![[User:Lf8u2|Lf8u2]]  

The word “children,” has at least two very clear connotations. One, is the biological meaning, which denotes a person who has not reached puberty. The other is the legal definition: commonly an age between 16 and 18.

Presently the article uses the word “children” 57 times. So its importance, even criticality, to the article, is plain.

As the article stands now, the word is defined differently by different sources, with some using [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5wel11pgdo no definition], some using [https://aoav.org.uk/2023/are-the-gazan-casualty-figures-being-reported-reliable-two-conflict-experts-compared-the-numbers-to-previous-attacks-and-conclude-they-are-credible/ under 15], and most using under 18. But this is only part of the issue. 

The larger issue is that it can be reasonably expected that a not uncommon read of the article will include the natural  inference that WP is in fact talking about the biological definition. I also think it reasonable that the absence of any attempt for the article to define this term suggests an imprecision, or even carelessness, not flattering to the article particularly, or to WP more generally.

To avoid this, my own view is that the first reference to “children” should include a parenthetical phrase which says something like:  “Generally defined as under 18.”  (Explanatory, methodological notes for this article are already prominent in the second paragraph in which GHM methodologies are explained.)

I assume there may be better ideas, and I hope to hear them. [[User:Johnadams11|Johnadams11]] ([[User talk:Johnadams11|talk]]) 17:06, 11 February 2025 (UTC)}}

Should we allow the customization of infobox background colors to reflect the color of the album or single cover?

Choices: {{ordered list |list-style-type=upper-alpha
|'''Yes''' – Infoboxes for songs and albums should have customizable background colors based on the significant colors of the album or single cover.

|'''No''' – Infoboxes for songs and albums should retain their current yellow or blue design without background colors.

{{rfcquote|text=
There has been previous discussions regarding whether the [[Israel–Hamas war]] & the [[Israeli invasion of Lebanon (2024–present)]] should be included in this article. The main question regarding this is whether or not this article covers only sovereign states (which Hamas & Hezbollah are not), or whether it covers non-sovereign states/political entities/paramilitaries. The lead of the article is vague in this distinction, but does specifically call out {{tq|national government}}. So, should both events be included or excluded?

*'''Option 1''' &ndash; Yes, both events should be included as this article should cover sovereign and non-sovereign state declarations of war.
*'''Option 2''' &ndash; No, both events should be excluded as this article should only cover sovereign state declarations of war and not included political entities/paramilitary-related declarations of war.
*'''Option 3''' &ndash; Include one but not the other (Specify which is included and which is excluded).

{{rfcquote|text=
I am requesting input from other editors regarding the level of detail in the description of the dilation and evacuation procedure in this article. My recent edits to expand this section, which included additional detail and references, were reverted. The current description in the article is as follows:
"Uterine contents are removed using a cannula to apply aspiration, followed by forceps to remove fetal parts."

I proposed revising this section to provide more specific details, including the instruments used and the other procedural steps. You can review my proposed changes in this edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dilation_and_evacuation&oldid=1270115407

I ask editors the following:

# Are terms such as "dismemberment" and "decapitation," which are referenced in medical literature, appropriate for inclusion?
# Should the article include information about the crushing of the fetal skull, a common part of the procedure?
# Should the article mention that dilation & evacuation is the most common abortion procedure in the second trimester?
I appreciate feedback from the community to help resolve this dispute. Thank you.

{{rfcquote|text=
The term '''"Secondary School Certificate"''' is specific to Bangladesh, while other countries use different names for similar exams, such as '''[[Secondary School Leaving Certificate]] (SSLC)''' in India, '''Senior Secondary School Certificate''' in Nigeria, and '''[[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE)''' in the UK. Additionally, many sections in the article about other countries lack proper sources or are poorly sourced, making the information difficult to verify. Given these discrepancies in naming and the lack of proper sourcing, I believe the article should focus exclusively on '''Bangladesh'''. The article '''"[[Secondary School Certificate (Bangladesh)]]"''' is already well-sourced and comprehensive.

So I suggest deleting the current '''"[[Secondary School Certificate]]"''' article, and moving the '''"[[Secondary School Certificate (Bangladesh)]]"''' article to the title '''"[[Secondary School Certificate]]"'''.

Problem: One side thinks that only the source which directly mentions the result of the '''war''' is valid, while other side thinks that all sources used for [[Battle of Khotyn (1621)]] are viable because it was the battle that determined the final outcome.

Therefore, what should the result be:

# Polish–Lithuanian victory (side with the source that directly mentions result of the war)
# Disputed, see aftermath (due to Battle of Khotyn being divided when it comes to results)
# Inconclusive

Do we use the books ('''The Jacksons: Legacy''' and '''Michael Jackson FAQ''') or the newspapers that claim that shows were on different days. Or should there be a compromise in which both the book(s) and newspapers be used, but in the form of ''efns'' that state that the shows were on different days "according to some sources". Please indicate your preference ("'''Books'''" or "'''Newspapers'''" or "'''Compromise'''") with your reasoning.

For years, tweets have commonly been included in articles using the Tweet template, which allows for the [[Tweet (social media)|tweet]]'s content to be displayed within the article in an easy to digest format. The template allows for the name, handle, and photograph of the tweeter to be included with the quote of their tweet. It provides important context to the quote in an easy to understand format, allowing for people to quickly understand that this was a twitter post, rather than a quote from somewhere else. Twitter is commonly used by celebrities, political figures, and other notable people to disperse information quickly and directly to their followers. Twitter's tweets are unique, short messages, so the source of the post is often relevant information, especially when a tweet has a major enough impact on an entity that the tweet itself is notable enough to end up on a Wikipedia page.

{{rfcquote|text=
[[MOS:INITIALS]] requires stops and spaces between people's initials:
{{blockquote|{{xt|An initial is capitalized and is followed by a [[full point]] (period) and a space (e.g. {{nowrap|[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]}}).}}}}

However, there are seven American political figures known often by their initials in shorthand, and their initials across Wikipedia are used unspaced, in violation of this policy:

# '''FDR''' for [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]
# '''JFK''' for [[John F. Kennedy]]
# '''JFK Jr.''' for [[John F. Kennedy Jr.]]
# '''RFK''' for [[Robert F. Kennedy]]
# '''RFK Jr.''' for [[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]]
# '''MLK''' for [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]
# '''LBJ''' for [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]

The only exception for spaced initials is given at [[MOS:BIOEXCEPT]], which allows formats such as [[CCH Pounder]] but requires that the format be used only when
{{blockquote|{{bulleted list|{{xt|the person has [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published or questionable sources as sources on themselves|clearly declared]] and consistently used a preferred exceptional style for their own name; {{em|and}}|an overwhelming majority of reliable sources use that exceptional style.}}}}}}

While some (but not all) sources currently write these names unspaced, the ''and'' requirement of [[MOS:BIOEXCEPT]] still restricts this usage as none of these men styled their names without spaces, preferring to go by their full names in nearly all cases. In John F. Kennedy's case, there is evidence he wrote his name with spaced initials.<ref name="J. F. K. book cover">{{cite object |description=Book with President Kennedy's initials |inscription=J.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;K. |id=JFKWHP-KN-20381 |author1-first=Robert |author1-last=Knudsen |museum=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum |exhibition=White House Photographs |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/jfkwhp-1962-03-07-f#?image_identifier=JFKWHP-KN-20381}}</ref><ref name="J.

Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum |url=https://jfk.artifacts.archives.gov/objects/13894/burning-tree-golf-club-bag-tag}}</ref>

Some style guides resolve this issue by making a difference in how spaced initials are treated when they are the full name. For instance, Turabian has
{{blockquote|{{xtn|Some individuals are known primarily by initials in place of a first and/or middle name. Such initials should be followed by a period and a space. If you abbreviate an entire name, however, omit periods and spaces.<br />G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;Chesterton but JFK<br />M.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;K. Fisher but FDR}}}}

A previous discussion at {{section link|Talk:Robert F. Kennedy Jr./Archive_8|"RFK Jr." vs "R. F. K. Jr."}} led to a discussion about modifying BIOEXCEPT at {{section link|Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Biography|MOS:BIOEXCEPT: and/or|nopage=y}}, which was inconclusive.

How should this discrepancy be resolved?
* '''Option 1''': No change to the MOS, '''update all pages to use spaced initials'''.
* '''Option 2: Modify [[MOS:INITIALS]]''' to add {{xt|If you abbreviate an entire name, however, omit periods and spaces}} from Turabian.
* '''Option 3: Modify [[MOS:BIOEXCEPT]]''' to remove the {{xt!|''and''}}-test and replace it with {{xt|''or''}}.
* '''Option 4''': As these examples are all Americans, '''deem this a [[MOS:ENGVAR]] issue''' and leave current styles intact.
* '''Option 5''' "Ignore the MOS if it is not helpful." (Added by Polygnotus without any explanation of what that's supposed to mean operationally.)
* '''Option 6''' ""Periods may be omitted when a person's full name is consistently abbreviated to just their initials, for instance MLK for Martin Luther King, Jr., if the common version of the abbreviation consistently appears without periods." (Added by SportingFlyer.)

#When followed by a person's name to form a title, i.e., when they can be considered to have become part of the name: {{xt|President Nixon}}, not {{!xt|president Nixon}}; {{xt|Pope John XXIII}}, not {{!xt|pope John XXIII}}.
#When a title is used to refer to a specific person as a substitute for their name during their time in office, e.g., {{xt|the King}}, not {{!xt|the king}} (referring to [[Charles&nbsp;III]]); {{xt|the Pope}}, not {{!xt|the pope}} (referring to [[Pope Francis|Francis]]).
#When a formal title for a specific entity (or conventional translation thereof) is addressed as a title or position in and of itself, is not plural, is not preceded by a modifier (including a definite or indefinite article), and is not a reworded description}}
Should we simplify [[MOS:JOBTITLES]] by removing exceptions #2 and/or #3? [[User:Surtsicna|Surtsicna]] ([[User talk:Surtsicna|talk]]) 22:52, 29 January 2025 (UTC)}}

Which image should be used in the Infobox? There has been consistent edit warring and changes to the infobox image since October. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yasuke#c-RelmC-20250116004100-RelmC-20250112180300] A discussion was had on which - or if any - image should be used to depict Yasuke ([[Talk:Yasuke#Yasuke Image|link to discussion topic]]) where no consensus was reached. Two of the images (the Sumō Yūrakuzu Byōbu and Rinpa Suzuri-bako) are discussed as possible depictions by sources and discussed on the page already. For more information on the sources, Rotary Engine compiled the current mentions in their comment ([[Talk:Yasuke#c-Rotary Engine-20250125120400-RelmC-20250112180300|here]]). Another option proposed using a modern artwork depiction by [[Anthony Azekwoh]]. Another option was to use no image in the infobox at all.

Louis Wain having schizophrenia is speculation done after his death, as his official diagnosis —while he was alive— was only of insanity. [https://artincontext.org/louis-wain/#Louis_Wains_Art_Style_and_Mental_Condition (1)] 

The paintings presented in the "timeline" also lack dates so the order is, therefore, inaccurate. [https://mindhacks.com/2007/09/26/the-false-progression-of-louis-wain/ (2)] 

"Attributed by some" is not a real source and is rather vague, convenient wording.

There has been an ongoing discussion regarding the use of the link to "[[Italians]]" in the Christopher Columbus article. Some editors argue that this link is anachronistic and does not reflect how Columbus or his contemporaries identified him, while others believe it is a valid descriptor based on modern labeling.  

The purpose of this RFC is to determine whether the link "[[Italians]]" should be retained, modified, or reconsidered in order to ensure historical accuracy and compliance with Wikipedia’s core policies on [[WP:V]] (Verifiability), [[WP:SYNTH]] (No Original Synthesis) and [[WP:BURDEN]] (Burden of Proof)

---
* '''Background'''

- The '''most widely accepted hypothesis''' regarding Columbus’s origin is that he was born in '''Genoa''', an independent republic at the time.  

- Columbus '''explicitly referred to himself as Genovese''', never as Italian.  

- There is no known evidence that Columbus ever spoke or wrote in Italian. No contemporary documents explicitly refer to him as "Italian"; instead, they consistently '''describe him as Genovese'''. 

- The '''concept of a [[Unification of Italy|unified Italy]] did not exist in Columbus’s lifetime'''.  At the time, the Italian peninsula consisted of multiple independent states, including the Republic of Genoa.  

- Many historians classify Columbus as Genovese and '''question the use of "Italian" as a historically accurate label'''. 

- Despite this, '''modern sources frequently refer to Columbus as "Italian",''' and he is often claimed by Italians as part of their historical and cultural legacy. 

- '''The use of "Italians" in the article may constitute a retrospective application of a modern label''', raising concerns about [[WP:V]] (Verifiability) and [[WP:SYNTH]] (No Original Synthesis).  

---
*'''Discussion question'''

Considering Wikipedia’s policies on Burden of Proof ([[WP:BURDEN]]), verifiability ([[WP:V]]) and no original synthesis ([[WP:SYNTH]]), should the link to "[[Italians]]" remain in the article as a descriptor for Columbus, or should it be:  

*1. '''Retained''' as is, with proper sourcing.  
*2. '''Nuanced''' to reflect historical context and avoid anachronism.  
*3. Placed in '''quotation marks''' to indicate its retrospective nature.  
*4. '''Removed''' if it is found to be inconsistent with contemporary sources.  

Please provide policy-based arguments and reliable sources to support your position. [[User:Pipo1955|Pipo1955]] ([[User talk:Pipo1955|talk]]) 19:58, 10 March 2025 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
An Executive Order was signed today, March 1, by President Trump titled [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/designating-english-as-the-official-language-of-the-united-states/ "Designating English as the Language of the United States"]. The main portions of note are within Section 3. Designating an Official Language for the United States:
* "(a)  English is the official language of the United States."
* "(b) [[Executive Order 13166]] of August 11, 2000 (Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency), is hereby revoked; nothing in this order, however, requires or directs any change in the services provided by any agency.  Agency heads should make decisions as they deem necessary to fulfill their respective agencies' mission and efficiently provide Government services to the American people.  Agency heads are not required to amend, remove, or otherwise stop production of documents, products, or other services prepared or offered in languages other than English."

That being said, Executive Orders are not legislation and are limited to the Executive Branch's interpretation of existing law. They can also be overturned by the next president. This EO also seems to be largely symbolic and does not require any substantial changes to federal programs per [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/trump-order-english-official-language.html the NYT], except that agencies are no longer required to support "programs for people with limited English proficiency" per [https://www.npr.org/2025/03/01/nx-s1-5313883/trump-english-official-language-executive-order NPR]. Usually, from what I can tell as well, official languages of countries are designated either in a country's constitution or through the legislative process. 

There have also been attempts to codify English as the official language through legislative means with more teeth, force of law, and would require official documents, laws, communications, and such, to be in English, as mentioned in the article [[English Language Unity Act]] and as seen by [https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/997/text H.R. 997 from the 118th Congress], but those efforts have never been signed into law. However, there is an argument that the Executive Branch could set policy in this space, though it is unprecedented. There's also a middle ground, such as including a note stating that "English is the official language of the Executive Branch per EO [number], but is not stated in the constitution or in federal law", similar to the way that we currently do for states. There's also an argument to wait and see how folks react. As such here are the options I envisioned, though I am open to other options.

Should we include "English" as the official language of the United States?
* '''A''': Yes, with no qualifications.
* '''B''': No, keep prior status quo.
* '''C''': Yes, with the qualifier that it is not mentioned in the Constitution or in applicable legislation.
* '''D''': State that there is no ''de jure'' official language, but mention that an official language has been set by the Executive Branch.
* '''E''': Wait.

{{rfcquote|text=
This article began in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=COVID-19_lab_leak_theory&oldid=1005881401 early 2021]. Within two weeks (at [[COVID-19 misinformation]]), an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:COVID-19_misinformation/Archive_9#RFC_to_fix_this_once_and_for_all RfC was held] to determine whether the lab leak theory should be called a "minority, but scientific viewpoint" or a "conspiracy theory". (No consensus was found.)

Since then, many scientists have weighed in on the issue, but intelligence agencies have, as well. The [https://apnews.com/article/covid-cia-trump-china-pandemic-lab-leak-9ab7e84c626fed68ca13c8d2e453dde1 CIA] and the [https://www.dw.com/en/covid-pandemic-likely-caused-by-wuhan-lab-accident-fbi/a-64848898 FBI under Joe Biden] have both publicly announced that they consider the lab leak to be the most likely possibility (the CIA is mildly confident, the FBI moreso). This week, the [https://www.dw.com/en/covid-pandemic-likely-unleashed-by-lab-mishap-germanys-bnd/a-71897701 German spy agency] has been reported by Reuters to have a fairly high level of confidence that the virus came from a lab.

How, then, should the lab leak theory be addressed, in both the lead and the body of this article?

'''Status Quo'''. Keep essentially the same: {{quote|The COVID-19 lab leak theory, or lab leak hypothesis, is the idea that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, came from a laboratory. This claim is highly controversial; most scientists believe the virus spilled into human populations through natural zoonosis ... similar to the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV outbreaks, and consistent with other pandemics in human history. Available evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was originally harbored by bats, and spread to humans from infected wild animals ... There is no evidence SARS-CoV-2 existed in any laboratory prior to the pandemic ... Many scenarios proposed for a lab leak are characteristic of conspiracy theories. Central to many is a misplaced suspicion based on the proximity of the outbreak to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), where coronaviruses are studied.}}

2. '''Treated as at least equally likely'''. Change the wording to reflect a (relatively) higher likelihood of the virus having in fact leaked from a laboratory: perhaps something like {{quote|The COVID-19 lab leak theory, or lab leak hypothesis, is the idea that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, came from a laboratory. This claim has been hotly debated over the years since the initial outbreak of the virus. Initially, many scientists believed that the virus had spilled into human populations through natural zoonosis ... similar to the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV outbreaks, and consistent with other pandemics in human history. However, multiple intelligence agencies have since asserted, with varying levels of confidence, that a leak is in fact the most likely scenario to have occurred. The lab leak theory was initially criticized and dismissed by some as a conspiracy theory due to its contravention of the initial scientific consensus; however...}}

3. '''Somewhere in between''', perhaps something like {{quote|The COVID-19 lab leak theory, or lab leak hypothesis, is the idea that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, came from a laboratory. This claim, while initially rejected by most scientists, has since been considered to be at least somewhat likely by the FBI and CIA.

(Note: A previous RfC on this topic was summarily closed by an editor who strongly prefers the status quo (and who has made several edits elsewhere on this talk page to that end). He called it a "biased" RfC without providing any evidence or explanation of bias. I have therefore proposed the RfC again, and would request it to stay the full 30 days, and would certainly ask for '''any closing editor to be someone who has not already publicly shown a clear point of view on the topic.''')

Is the article by Miesel [https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2021/09/14/a-monument-to-pseudo-religiosity-a-case-against-the-poem-of-the-man-god/] a reliable source for the [[Poem of the Man-God]] criticism section, when it contains multiple factual historical errors concerning the actions of the Catholic Church in relation to Valtorta's work?
Miesel admits in her article that she is a laywoman and not a theologian. She then states:

"Furthermore, on April 17, 1993, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith directed the Italian Bishops’ Conference to order this disclaimer placed in future re-issues of the Poem: “…the ‘visions’ and ‘dictations’ referred to in it are simply literary forms used by the author to narrate in her own way the life of Jesus. They cannot be considered supernatural in origin."

That is incorrect. Catholic scholar and theologian Fr. Anthony Pillari clearly states that this was Ratzinger's personal opinion and not that of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which had not held formal discussions on the issue, and hence had no juridic value.[https://doi.org/10.20381/ruor-21436]

In addition, the text to which Miesel is confusedly referring to was a letter from Cardinal Tettamanzi who wrote to Emilio Pisani, the publisher of the Poem, requesting that a disclaimer be placed on the work. Once again, Fr. Anthony Pillari states that was the personal opinion of Tettamanzi, not of the Catholic Conference of Bishops, since no formal meeting was recorded as having taken place on the subject, which therefore caused Tettamanzi's position to have no juridic value.[https://doi.org/10.20381/ruor-21436]

With such basic errors in reporting multiple important historical facts, does Miesel's article adhere to [[WP:RS]]?

Film gauge is a measure of the width of photo and movie films, and is written as the width of the film in millimeters followed by the unit “mm”. Film gauges can be written either with a space (35{{nbsp}}mm film), without a space (35mm film), or with a hyphen (35-mm film).

In the context of film gauges, should Wikipedia:

TLDR: Should the section be left there, or deleted?

Context is in conversation above. I am not very sure as to the verifiability, so I will hand the issue over to more knowledgeable individuals. 

On one hand, the section has been the stable version for quite a long time, and had sources which are also long-standing

On the other hand, @[[:User:Satheravi]] has raised new evidence which state otherwise, and i am not capable of discerning whether they "outweigh" the current sources. 

Help will be appreciated, and I will not try to bludgeon this any further if a consensus is reached, whatever the result is. —[[User:Mint Keyphase|Mint Keyphase]] ([[User talk:Mint Keyphase|Did I mess up?]] ''' ''' [[Special:Contributions/Mint Keyphase|What have I done?]]) 09:01, 3 March 2025 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The article exhibits significant issues with the framing of its content, demonstrating a clear bias towards certain identity-based conclusions. This bias is evident in how specific claims are presented, particularly regarding the relationship to ancient Egypt. There is a strong overemphasis on unverified statements, such as "Copts are the direct descendants of the Ancient Egyptians," which lack credible academic sources and misrepresent genetic history. Furthermore, vague and oversimplified language like "Coptic music is a continuation of ancient Egyptian music" and "Coptic culture is considered a continuation of that of ancient Egypt" diminishes the complexity of these cultural histories and risks misleading readers. 

Such claims in the article are backed by self-published sources, qualitative studies from unrelated fields, and even [[WP:OR]]. My own attempts to address these issues have been largely reverted, leaving them pervasive throughout the article. The editor heavily involved in the article insists on including such statements, stating that they are established facts, and has repeated them throughout the text. The quality of the article, which was previously a good article nominee, has, unfortunately, deteriorated significantly due to a lack of consideration for [[WP:MOS]].

On March 1, 2025, President [[Donald Trump]] has signed and published the [[executive order]] "Designating English as the Official Language of The United States". The full text is available [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/designating-english-as-the-official-language-of-the-united-states/ here]. This has been [[WP:BOLD]]ly reflected in the article, but since it is likely to be challenged by some editors, I'm creating this [[WP:RFC|request for comment]] to get consensus on how we should handle this.

The order plainly states that it makes no ''legal'' change except for rescinding [[Executive Order 13166]]; agencies are no longer required to provide services or documents in languages other than English, but are not directed to necessarily make any changes.

The order does designate English as the United States' official language, even if no changes to the legal code have been made. <span lang="en">&mdash;&nbsp;[[:User:Gabldotink|gabldotink]] <small>[&nbsp;[[:User talk:Gabldotink|talk]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[:Special:Contributions/Gabldotink|contribs]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[m:Special:CentralAuth/Gabldotink|global account]]&nbsp;]</small></span> 01:57, 2 March 2025 (UTC)}}

This article does not follow [[WP:COMMONNAME]]. I would point people to the precedents set by the move request from the name Bangalore to [[Bengaluru]] in 2024: [[Talk:Bengaluru#c-Sceptre-20241122204400-Requesting move from Bangalore to Bengaluru|Here]]. 
Realistically, Bangalore is far more commonly used name both worldwide and in India. Regardless, that is an essentially anecdotal, subjective statement and there exists a WP standard for this reason. The Bengaluru moves adheres to the standard.

This article adhered to the standard when it changed to 'Denali' in 2015. It currently does not. It is factually true that the [https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/ap-style-guidance-on-gulf-of-mexico-mount-mckinley/ AP] as well as [https://x.com/britannica/status/1889724479967830244?s=46 Britannica] are following the federal name change. This is not to mention that every map of the world in every textbook and atlas used in US schools from 1896 to 2015 used Mt. McKinley. I don't believe it is unreasonable to assume this to be proof of a status quo. The Obama name change was an obvious deviation from this well established status quo of more than a century – Wikipedia followed it still, as it was in accordance with COMMONNAME standards. 

I would like to understand why that same standard is not being applied presently. We are either to say the COMMONNAME rules are in need of relitigation, or the article title must be changed to 'Mt. McKinley'. [[User:Jibolba|Jibolba]] ([[User talk:Jibolba|talk]]) 22:35, 21 March 2025 (UTC)}}

Hi all, I want to gather consensus to change the links of the leads of the articles that currently exist in [[List of rugby union clubs in Germany]]. In some of the articles ([[FT Adler Kiel Rugby]] (I've edited), [[TSV Handschuhsheim]], [[RG Heidelberg]], [[RG Heidelberg]], [[Heidelberger TV]], and many more). All of these articles in the lead, say "(CLUBNAME) is a German [[rugby union]] [[:Category:German rugby union clubs|club]]<--red link ...". I figured out the red link happened because the category page was moved from [[:Category:German rugby union clubs]] to [[:Category:Rugby union clubs in Germany]], with no redirect left behind. A good idea would be to fix all these links to point to the new category, but I think an edit like I did [[Special:Diff/1282388955|here]], would be nice, since the category page lists only the clubs that exist as articles, but the list includes a full list.

''' RFC: Review of multiple proposed edits (conflict of interest declared) '''

<!-- [[User:DoNotArchiveUntil]] 17:01, 15 May 2025 (UTC) -->{{User:ClueBot III/DoNotArchiveUntil|1747328475}}
Hello everyone,

As a paid contributor with a declared conflict of interest, I have suggested several improvements and updates to the Advans article on this [[Talk:Advans|Talk page]] over the past few weeks. In accordance with Wikipedia’s COI and paid contribution guidelines, I have not edited the article directly and have instead submitted all proposed changes here for review and consensus.

I am now requesting a community review of the set of proposals listed throughout this [[Talk:Advans|Talk page]]. These edits cover the following topics:

- Clarification of Advans' history, including its international operations and divestments in Asia (Cambodia, Pakistan, Myanmar).
- Addition of verified information on client protection certifications received by subsidiaries (Amret and Advans Tunisia), based on independent audits.
- Integration of information related to the El Baya loan product for women entrepreneurs in Tunisia, in partnership with GIZ.
- Updates on the group’s climate resilience strategy and its financial inclusion goals.
- Minor structural and wording adjustments for clarity and neutrality.


I would greatly appreciate feedback from other editors regarding the suitability, neutrality, and encyclopedic value of these proposed additions.

Thank you in advance for your time and guidance! [[User:Solenereboulet|Solenereboulet]] ([[User talk:Solenereboulet|talk]]) 16:11, 10 April 2025 (UTC)}}

According to their [https://knowyourmeme.com/about About page], {{tq|Know Your Meme's research is handled by an independent professional editorial and research staff and community members.}} The site features different categories of entries, including those marked as "Confirmed," which according to KYM have been carefully researched and verified by the research staff.

Currently, KYM is listed among user-generated content sources considered generally unreliable per [[WP:UGC]]. This RFC seeks to determine whether "Confirmed" articles on KYM, which have undergone editorial review and fact-checking by staff, should be considered reliable sources for limited use in Wikipedia articles about internet memes and web culture.

''' Proposal (KYM) '''

Little discussion has been had about KYM articles marked as "Confirmed" in the past. The last time this was discussed was [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_293#Citing_individual_Youtube_reviews_and_Know_Your_Meme 5 years ago], though this was when there was no information about KYM's editorial process or staff, and the result of the discussion was still unclear. Since then, KYM has developed a more robust editorial process with clear guidelines for verification and fact-checking, as outlined on their [https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/rules-and-guidelines/ Editorial Rules] page. The site now has an established team of professional editors with specific roles and responsibilities, and their "Confirmed" status has become a meaningful indicator of editorial review rather than merely user-generated content.

I propose that KYM articles '''clearly marked as "Confirmed" or written by staff (e.g. [https://trending.knowyourmeme.com/news/rumored-dan-hentschel-tv-show-on-max-has-fans-on-twitter-excited-but-it-seems-to-be-a-lie])''' may be used as reliable sources for limited purposes in Wikipedia, specifically:

* For articles about internet memes and web culture
* When properly attributed (e.g., "According to ''Know Your Meme''...")
* For factual information about the origin, spread, and evolution of memes
* Not for use in [[WP:BLP|biographies of living persons]]
* Not to be used in Wikipedia's voice ([[WP:WIKIVOICE]])

KYM's editorial process for "Confirmed" articles involves fact-checking and verification by professional staff. Their [https://knowyourmeme.com/guidelines guidelines] state that {{tq|''Know Your Meme'' staff review and fact-check content thoroughly}} and that they {{tq|are careful to cite only reliable sources and strive to provide an impartial and balanced variety of perspectives.}} Their [https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/rules-and-guidelines/ editorial guidelines] clearly state the dos-and-dont's before a submission is {{tq|properly researched and eventually confirmed}}.

This RFC does not propose any changes to the status of KYM articles marked as "Submission" or "Deadpool", which would remain unreliable per [[WP:UGC]]. [[User:Abayomi2003|Abayomi2003]] ([[User talk:Abayomi2003|talk]]) 18:57, 22 March 2025 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Hello,

I would like to raise a concern regarding recent edits to this article, particularly in relation to adherence to Wikipedia’s sourcing guidelines. In the latest revisions, all previously included academic references and scientifically grounded content were removed. Unfortunately, the current version seems to rely heavily on promotional language and lacks the independent, verifiable sources required by Wikipedia.

If an editor wishes to improve or expand the article, the appropriate approach would be to **edit and build upon** the existing content—not to remove well-sourced scientific information and replace it with content connected to a commercial entity. This approach may violate Wikipedia’s core principles on [neutral point of view](<nowiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view</nowiki>), [verifiability](<nowiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability</nowiki>), and [conflict of interest](<nowiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest</nowiki>).

I suggest we consider restoring the original content supported by academic sources, particularly as references to key sources like the articles and webpages from Warsaw University of Technology have been removed. I also encourage the editor, especially if this is their first edit on Wikipedia, to add the relevant research papers that were originally mentioned.

Thank you! [[User:Alicja Głaszczka|Alicja Głaszczka]] ([[User talk:Alicja Głaszczka|talk]]) 13:39, 17 April 2025 (UTC)}}

'''To better align with [[WP:NPOV]], should each section that introduces the term “safe” or “safety” in reference to abortion include a brief clarification at first mention—specifically, that “safe” refers to the pregnant woman undergoing the abortion, not the embryo or fetus?'''

For example, take the current first mention of safety in the lead:

''When done legally in industrialized societies, induced abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine.''

This proposal would adjust that statement to something like:

''When done legally in industrialized societies, induced abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine for the woman receiving it.''

'''Feel free to vote and comment with one of the following options:'''

* '''Yes, Option A''' — The article should clarify, when safety is first addressed in each section, that it is addressing safety for the individual undergoing the abortion.
* '''Yes, Option B''' — The article should only clarify it two times: at the first mention of safety in the entire article, and at the first mention of safety in the "Safety" section.
* '''Yes, Option C''' — The article should indeed clarify it, but should do so in a footnote.
* '''No''' — The article should '''NOT''' clarify whose safety is being discussed.

{{rfcquote|text=
Firstly, let me set out that I am opening this RFC because similar questions to mine have arisen on this talk page over the years without responses, so I think it is due time to call an RFC, as it would be apparent there would be little if anyone that would respond, given the lack of prior responses on this talk page.

This page is currently very misleading. Assisted suicide and euthanasia are two separate and different things. Euthanasia is ending the life of ''another'' person or animal that is either terminally ill or undergoing unacceptable suffering. Assisted suicide on the other hand one person aiding another in ''taking their own life''. Note: I placed in italics what the key difference is. This distinction is further exemplified by the fact that there is a page called [[Assisted suicide in the United States]]. However, this page uses the term "assisted suicide" multiple times, seemingly conflating euthanasia with assisted suicide, despite the two being distinct and different; therefore, misleading the reader. The whole section for Maine for example only refers to assisted dying, not euthanasia, which this article is about, along with multiple other uses of the term assisted suicide throughout the page.

So where do we go from here? Do we take down the page and put it into draft status until these issues are fixed, or are there people that are willing to run through the page and correct the conflations between assisted suicide and euthanasia and eliminate any use of the former term from this article? I can't say it’s something I have the time to do personally. [[User:Helper201|Helper201]] ([[User talk:Helper201|talk]]) 00:54, 27 March 2025 (UTC)}}

The narrow question is which term to use in article mainspace: "'''''illegal''''' immigrant" versus "'''''undocumented''''' immigrant". The issue focuses on the adjective applied to the noun ''immigrant''—the individual.

Of course, this RfC does not affect discussion of ''the terms themselves'' in the article.

{{rfcquote|text=
The Syrian Civil War has been reported as officially over by several major international outlets, such as the New York Times, NPR, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, BBC, Reuters, The Financial Times, The Economist, and AP News, among others. Some reports claim that the fall of Assad’s regime in December 2024 and the formation of a caretaker government mark the end of the civil war. However, other editors feel that there has been insufficient consensus to declare the war officially over.

Here are a few articles that have reported Syria’s civil war as ended:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/middleeast/syria-president-al-shara-interview.html Syria’s Jihadist-Turned-President Seeks New Allies] - The New York Times

“The fear of renewed turmoil in Syria is shared by global powers as the country emerges from a nearly 14-year civil war that sent millions of refugees abroad and enters a new chapter under Mr. al-Shara’s Islamist government.”

“It remains unclear what role, if any, Russia will play in postwar Syria. But Mr. al-Shara said Moscow had supplied the Syrian military for decades, implying that his country may need Russia or other nations’ support again in the future.”

The article is also categorized under “Syria After Civil War”. 

[https://www.npr.org/2025/04/21/nx-s1-5361048/syria-white-helmets With Assad gone and Syria's war over, the White Helmets have a new mission] - NPR

“Now, with Syria's civil war over, the White Helmets are taking on a new challenge: Their founder, Raed Saleh, has been appointed to Syria's Cabinet as minister of emergencies and disaster management, and the force he started 12 years ago is expanding its services — for the first time — to the entire country.”

[https://archive.is/2025.04.18-100422/https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/u-s-toughens-demands-on-syrias-new-islamist-led-leadership-695bff58 U.S. Toughens Demands on Syria’s New Islamist-Led Leadership] - The Wall Street Journal

“The guidance reflects skepticism among administration officials of Syria’s government, which is led by former rebel commanders who ousted President Bashar al-Assad from power in December, ending the country’s 13-year-long civil war.”

[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/mar/13/the-reluctant-collaborator-surviving-syrias-brutal-civil-war-and-its-aftermath The reluctant collaborator: surviving Syria’s brutal civil war – and its aftermath] - The Guardian

“When the forces of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist group that led the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, swept into Damascus at the end of the war, they found a city that looked old and exhausted, worn out by years of violence and crippling sanctions, its Ottoman and Mamluk architecture blackened by the fumes of rattling old cars and buses.”

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/12/erdogan-lambasts-israel-for-undermining-stability-in-syria Erdoğan lambasts Israel for undermining stability in Syria] - The Guardian

“Assad’s overthrow marked the end of over 50 years of dictatorial rule by his family, as well as a halt to a decade-long civil war that became a frozen proxy conflict.”

[https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4nqe3724vo Syrians have more freedom after Assad, but could they lose it?] - BBC

"The interim government is running out of funds, security forces are overstretched, poverty is deepening and insurgency is brewing at the periphery. Outsiders are meddling. Western sanctions deprive leaders of what they need to rebuild, while preventing fragmentation or a return to civil war."

[https://www.ft.com/content/5fe34023-a81f-4f1a-baf5-4059b69121c9 Israel and Turkey begin talks to avoid conflict in Syria] - The Financial Times

“Turkey, which long-backed the Syrian opposition, became the main foreign power in Syria after Islamist rebels toppled the regime of Bashar al-Assad in December, ending more than a decade of civil war.”

“Abdallah Dardari told Reuters in Damascus that investing in Syria - hit hard by 14 years of conflict that ended when former leader Bashar al-Assad was ousted by a rebel offensive in December and fled the country - was seen as a "global public good."

“Since former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad was toppled last year after a nearly 14-year civil war, his successors have called on the international community to lift sanctions imposed against the country during his rule.”

“Some minorities may see benefits in allying with Israel today. Syria is now ruled by a former al-Qaeda leader. A recent massacre of minority Alawites on the country’s coast has left them crying for protection. Many Syrian manual workers, who are destitute after the civil war, are aware they could earn many times more in Israel.”

“While the nearly 14-year Syrian civil war came to an end with the fall of Bashar Assad on Dec. 8, war remnants continue to kill and maim.”

We are seeking input on the following:
1. Do you think the Syrian Civil War has officially ended, based on the sources provided?
2. Should the Wikipedia article reflect this, and if so, how should this be worded?

The discussion on this issue has been ongoing for several months without reaching a resolution, so we are now seeking broader input from the community.

Should the infobox for Inah Canabarro Lucas include things like "oldest living nun", "oldest living person in South America", and "oldest living person in Latin America", or should those be moved to the article body?
These claims are accurate, but they don’t seem to get much attention in reliable sources. The subject is mainly known for being the oldest living person in the world. Per [[WP:DUE]] and [[WP:RS]], should the infobox focus only on what’s most notable and widely covered?
For example, Lucile Randon was the oldest nun ever, but even her infobox didn’t list “nun” as something she was known for. Should we treat these extra titles the same way and keep them out of the infobox?

This page has been using [[Template:Infobox political party]] for several years at this point (since [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeffersonian_democracy&direction=next&oldid=961115037 5 September 2020]), and I'd like to make the case that this infobox should either be removed, replaced, or greatly overhauled. It's not helpful to portray individual ideologies as if they were organised political parties with their own ideologies and it seems like the infobox on this page (as well as on pages such as [[Anti-Federalism]]) is causing repeated content disputes.

On top of that, almost none of the currently-utilised parameters in the infobox are appropriate:


"Ideology" — Jeffersonian democracy is ''itself'' an ideology, or at the very least an ideological movement.

"Dissolved" — How can an ideology or a political philosophy be dissolved?

"Colors" — Ideologies can't have colors.

"Historical leaders" — Again, this isn't a party, there can't therefore be a leader.

"Merged into" — As Jeffersonian democracy wasn't an organised party, there's no entity to merge into anything.

I would like to formally understand what the community would think of a date-fixing bot. Such a bot would fix dates in articles to conform either {{tlx|Use dmy dates}} or {{tlx|Use mdy dates}}. To be clear, this bot would not revert any good faith changes that add content and dates of the wrong format; instead, it will just change the date format. In my opinion, there are a few different ways such a bot could be implemented (or not):
* '''Option 1''': no bot, everything stays as is
* '''Option 2a''': a supervised bot (so every edit is manually reviewed before publication) that would have to pass BRFA to be implemented. I think this would alleviate any concerns of the bot creating errors based on context (such as changing date formats in quotes, links, references, etc.)
* '''Option 2b''': an automatic bot that does something similar in proposal 2a, but wouldn't actually have its edits be checked before implementation
* '''Option 3''': some other solution; no guarantee that this is actually feasible

1) Should the articles of any NBA players say that they are often considered one of the greatest players of all time?  

: Example: [[Hakeem Olajuwon|[Hakeem] Olajuwon]] is widely considered one of the greatest basketball players of all time.

2) If the answer to the previous question is yes, what standard should be used? Note: this question is '''optional'''

: 2a) Every [[NBA 75th Anniversary Team|NBA 75]] player is listed as one of the greatest.
: 2b) The following list of basketball players: 
:: [[Bill Russell]]
:: [[Wilt Chamberlain]]
:: [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]
:: [[Larry Bird]]
:: [[Magic Johnson]]
:: [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]
:: [[Michael Jordan]]
:: [[Shaquille O'Neal]]
:: [[Kobe Bryant]]
:: [[Tim Duncan]]
:: [[LeBron James]]
: 2c) The statement is only included if sources discussing the player's legacy commonly state that that player is one of the greatest in the history of basketball, or use equivalent superlative language. 
:: Example of sourcing for the claim of [[Bill Russell]] being one of the greatest of all time: [https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/sport/bill-russell-nba-legend-dies-spt-intl/index.html NBA legend], [https://abcnews.go.com/US/nba-legend-bill-russell-dead-88/story?id=87711171 the greatest winner in basketball history], [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-russell-dies-age-88-celtics-legend-11-time-nba-champion/ is widely considered one of the greatest basketball players of all time], [https://www.bbc.com/sport/basketball/62372000 basketball great], [https://apnews.com/article/bill-russell-nba-obit-48db4e1f37deb6e6574263c9f42dee46 NBA great], [https://x.com/SInow/status/1553793920978518017 one of the greatest players of all-time], [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/34323568/boston-celtics-great-bill-russell-11-nba-champion-dies-88 the ultimate winner].
:2d) Any other criteria; if this option is selected, please do not simply give a different list of basketball players, but rather a different standard from which the inclusion or exclusion of a given player can be assessed through application of some common criteria.
Context: Various historical NBA players have been called "one of the greatest", "the greatest of all-time", or "the greatest at a position" by the press, magazines, books, former players, experts, etc. These terms are very subjective in nature and cover a 75+ year history, but can be sourced none-the-less. Discussions have ranged from the terms being vital to non-encyclopedic, from leaving the term in a player legacy section to prominently being displayed in the lead to not using the term at all. Please help us out with a yes or no on the term "greatest" in the lead section and the reasoning behind it. Thanks.

Does [[WP:GNG]] allow for album reviews containing substantive, in-depth analysis to ground the notability of a song article, or does the categorical prohibition in [[WP:NSONG]] apply?

# If a song article has substantive in-depth coverage across multiple reliable sources, but they  are all album reviews, it can still be notable under [[WP:GNG]] despite plainly failing [[WP:NSONG]]. [[WP:NSONG]] should be modified to remove the prohibition on album reviews to establish notability, and refer to [[WP:SIGCOV]].
# A song being substantively covered across multiple reliably-sourced album reviews is not a sufficient basis for notability—a notable song should be the subject of multiple non-trivial published works. NSONG should be clarified as superseding GNG for songs.

{{rfcquote|text=
The Cambridge Dictionary [https://web.archive.org/web/20231102164711/https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/taiwan previously defined] Taiwan as “{{tq|an island country in East Asia}},” but [https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/taiwan it has now revised the definition] to: “{{tq|A large island to the east of China, together with some nearby smaller islands, that has its own government. Taiwan is claimed by the People's Republic of China as its territory.}}”

Some Wikipedia editors have resisted removing the word “country” because [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] have referred to Taiwan as such. However, I believe the Cambridge Dictionary is a representative and reliable source. Moreover, after [[WP:TWRFC|the 2020 RFC]], many reliable sources have adjusted their wording to avoid directly labeling Taiwan as a “country.”

Certain editors argue that “Taiwan” in English primarily refers to a country, while the island or geographical area is [[zh:臺灣|the primary meaning in Chinese]]. But as far as I know, the [[Cambridge Dictionary]] is written by [[British people|British]], not Chinese, authors. I'm not sure whether British people are more likely to understand [[English]] better than Chinese people.

Some editors claim that China's stance is irrelevant to Taiwan's definition. However, the Cambridge Dictionary has placed China's claim in a prominent part of the entry.

So far, I haven’t heard of China bribing the Cambridge Dictionary, nor have I heard of Chinese hackers infiltrating its website.

I hope the Wikipedia community will reconsider how Taiwan is defined. [[Special:Contributions/49.157.47.20|49.157.47.20]] ([[User talk:49.157.47.20|talk]]) 06:30, 6 May 2025 (UTC)}}

Does the scope of WP:MILHIST also include unarmed coast guards like the [[China Maritime Safety Administration|CMSA]] or the [[Canadian Coast Guard|Canadian coast guard]]? Additionally, do unarmed coast guards used for paramilitary purposes like the [[China Marine Surveillance|CMS]] fall under the scope of WP:MILHIST even though they are unarmed? On the same topic, do armed agencies with a civilian law enforcement role (like the [[CBP Air and Marine Operations]]) fall under WP:MILHIST?

If there are no rules on this yet, I propose one of 5 solutions:

# '''All coast guards fall under the scope of WP:MILHIST'''
# '''Only armed coast guards like the [[United States Coast Guard|USCG]] or [[China Coast Guard|CCG]] fall under the scope of WP:MILHIST'''
# '''Unarmed coast guards fall under the scope of WP:MILHIST if they are used for non-search and rescue military purposes (e.g. CMS)'''
# '''Unarmed coast guards fall under the scope of WP:MILHIST if they are organizationally under the military, such as [[Maritime Search and Rescue (Mexico)|Mexican Maritime Search and Rescue]]'''
# '''All armed coast guards with military weapons(e.g. CBPAMO) fall under WP:MILHIST regardless of role'''

Should this article contain information about James Gunn? The assertion that James "rewrote the whole script" is just that, an assertion by a party in dispute, common in credit disputes and already heavily covered in the Guardians of the Galaxy article.

The WGA arbitration exists to make a formal determination of whether James "rewrote the whole script." If he had, he would have been awarded sole credit. He wasn't, so that claim was invalidated. This is weird Twitter fanboy beef brought to Wikipedia. This a longstanding dispute that has resulted in a number of edit wars elsewhere and might require limited protections for this article.

{{rfcquote|text=
Does the current "Radicalisation narratives" section in the *Femosphere* article comply with core Wikipedia content policies - ''specifically, WP:NPOV, WP:SYNTH, WP:V, and WP:OR''?

* This discussion follows the AfD outcome ''(‘Keep, without prejudice toward a rewrite to address NPOV and other content issues’).''

The section groups several claims ''(e.g., rejection of liberal feminism, invocation of fallacies, mimicry of manosphere logic)'' into what appears to be an established “radicalisation narrative” or “pipeline.” 

However:

#Some sources do not use the term “femosphere” at all ''(e.g., referring instead to “womanosphere”)'', which may raise WP:SYNTH concerns if they’re synthesized to support the same point.
#Several claims appear in Wikipedia’s voice without clear attribution to secondary sources, which may affect WP:NPOV and WP:V compliance.
#None of the cited sources define or support the grouping of these ideas together under any "radicalisation narrative" or "pipeline," raising concerns under WP:OR and WP:SYNTH. One source ''(The Guardian, 2024)'' states that ''"there's no evidence to say that the femosphere is radicalizing its members in the same way as the manosphere,"'' which appears to contradict the framing of the section.

Editors are invited to weigh in on how best to bring the section into alignment with policy. 

'''Potential options might include ''(but are not limited to)'':'''

* '''Option A''': Keep as is
* '''Option B''': Revise for clearer attribution, sourcing, or scope
* '''Option C''': Remove section until stronger sourcing is available

{{rfcquote|text=
It has been bothering me for a while that some of Eilish's songs that are assigned as singles, since not every standalone release is a single. That is why I think we should move certain songs into promotional singles category. I have put it into a numbered list, to explain why these examples should be switched:
# "[[Come Out and Play (Billie Eilish song)|Come Out and Play]]" (2018) – song released to be used in a commercial, not tied to any project (besides being a <u>bonus</u> track on Japanese edition of ''[[When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?]]'' (2019)). No airplay release, no physical release either.
# "[[When I Was Older]]" (2019) – song inspired by a movie ''[[Roma (2018 film)|Roma]]'' (2018), later included in soundtrack album for it and as a bonus track on Japanese edition of her debut album. No airplay release, no physical release either.
# "[[Wish You Were Gay]]" (2019) – song released as more of a charity single, but it also was included in the standard track listing of her debut album. It did not got neither airplay, nor physical release, and was pushed so close to the album release date, I would categorize it as a promo single.
# "[[Lost Cause (Billie Eilish song)|Lost Cause]]" (2021) – another example of song getting pushed close to the album's release, with no airplay and physical release. The song's release date was also unusual, and it is actually the first song on that list that was promoted by a music video, however non-singles also can get visual independent of the album (ex. "[[Xanny (song)|Xanny]]" from her debut album).
# "[[Male Fantasy]]" (2021) – even though I have created the article about this one, now I do not believe that since some magazines call a song a single it should be categorized as such. It got only music video treatment and a single performance during its "single release" month, not much promotion, especially knowing that it did not appeared on any physical formats or on radios. It did not even had its own separate digital release.
# "[[Hotline Bling#Covers and usage in media|Hotline (Edit)]]" (2023) – literally just a portion of previously released single should definitely not be counted as a separate single release. No airplay release, no physical release either.
Update: I think, there are actually more examples than I initially thought of. I am less knowledgeable about her dbeut EP days, that is why I have not included her earlier singles in the list.
#<li value=7> "[[Bored (song)|Bored]]" (2017) and "[[Lo Vas a Olvidar]]" (2021) – another soundtrack songs with no physical release, or airplay release.
# "[[Watch (Billie Eilish song)|Watch]]", "[[Copycat (Billie Eilish song)|Copycat]]", "[[Idontwannabeyouanymore]]", and "[[My Boy (Billie Eilish song)|My Boy]]" (all 2017) – all of these songs were released shortly one at another in anticipation of the EP, some of them got remixed versions released, but still no physical or radio release.
# "[[&Burn]]", "[[Bitches Broken Hearts]]", and "[[Party Favor (song)|Party Favor]]" (all 2018) – all of these songs were issued as standalone releases before getting added as bonus tracks of her debut EP. No radio release, however "Party Favor" was released physically, even before its digital release, but it still does not make it official single.

Before supporting option 3, please consider whether your objection might be better accommodated as a special exception under options 1 or 2.

Note in particular that option 1 would not provide license for editors to indiscriminately remove unsourced content from these sections—not any more than option 2 would provide license for editors to add large amounts of content to these lists without any stated justification. In most case, both of these behaviors would be considered [[WP:Disruptive editing]] in the same way that they would for such edits made to the prose body of an article, and they would be treated accordingly.

This is the first time I have formally requested comments from the community in this way.

I am opening this RfC to gain community consensus on the following proposed addition to the "Career" section of the Yura Borisov article:

> "In 2024, Borisov faced criticism for filming in Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine and for his involvement in films described by *The Guardian* as aligned with Russian state propaganda.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sauer |first=Pjotr |date=2025-03-03 |title=Russian state propagandists overjoyed at Anora’s Oscar triumph |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/03/anora-oscar-triumph-russian-state-propagandists-overjoyed |access-date=2025-05-15 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>"

**Supporting points:**
- *The Guardian* article specifically names Borisov and discusses his starring role in *Kalashnikov*, which it notes was partially filmed in Crimea (occupied Ukrainian territory).
- *The Guardian* is a reliable source per WP:RS.
- There was a prior Third Opinion (3O) supporting inclusion.
- Per WP:UNDUE and WP:BLP, sourced criticism — especially from a major news outlet — is appropriate when attributed and balanced.
- Although the article doesn’t explicitly say “he was criticized,” it strongly implies it by linking his film work to Russian state propaganda and placing it in a critical context.

**Opposing editors argue:**
- The *Guardian* article doesn’t directly state Borisov was criticized.
- It does not confirm which scenes were filmed in Crimea or whether Borisov was involved in those scenes.
- The criticism is more implied than explicit, and may not meet WP:BLP standards for inclusion.

Your input is welcome. Please weigh in on whether this sourced criticism is appropriate to include in the Career section of the article.

{{rfcquote|text=
On  22 April 2025 (02:19) I updated the article [[Implicational propositional calculus]]. A few hours later the update was reverted with the argument that ''"I am missing the whole point which is to avoid using falsum in the formulas"''. Could a third party please verify that claim.

Aside from that, in my opinion the article needs substantial improvements:
* The article should place implicational calculus in its historical context by tracing its development from ‘’[[Begriffsschrift]]’’, through ‘’[[Principia Mathematica]]’’, and on to later contributions by the [[Lwów–Warsaw school]], [[Gerhard Gentzen|Gentzen]], and others. This would reveal the evolution from the axiomatic [[Hilbert system|Hilbert-style proof systems]] to the more intuitive methods of [[Method of analytic tableaux|analytic tableaux]], [[natural deduction]] or [[sequent calculus]].
* The article should highlight that implicational calculus {{mdash}} with <math>\bot</math>{{mdash}} adequately covers classical logic, but does not suffice for full intuitionistic logic, where conjunction (<math>\land</math>) and disjunction (<math>\lor</math>) are essential, rather than merely [[syntactic sugar]]. This important distinction should not be overlooked.

As to the sections,
* The section ''[[Implicational propositional calculus#Completeness|Completeness]]'' is either undocumented or based on (forbidden) original research. The reader loses track in the midst of formal derivations.
* The section ''[[Implicational propositional calculus#The Bernays–Tarski axiom system|The Bernays–Tarski axiom system]]'' should either be relocated to the article ''[[List of axiomatic systems in logic]]'' or better justified in context. Highlighting one alternative among a plethora of axiom systems appears arbitrary and lacks relevance to the broader purpose of the article.
* The section ''[[Implicational propositional calculus#Satisfiability and validity|Satisfiability and validity]]'' discusses the [[NP (complexity)|NP-complexity]] of the [[Boolean satisfiability problem|propositional satisfiability problem]]. Either the computational complexity angle should be considered as beyond the scope of the article and removed, or should be addressed with appropriate context. Note that the examples provided implicitly use the [[method of analytic tableaux]], while the article only deploys [[Hilbert system|Hilbert-style deduction systems]].
* The section ''[[Implicational propositional calculus#Adding an axiom schema|Adding an axiom schema]]'' illustrates that adding non-tautologies {{mdash}}think of a bare propositional variable <math>P</math>{{mdash}} as axioms makes the system inconsistent. This is a trivial point and comes across as unprofessional. The section should be removed.
* The section ''[[Implicational propositional calculus#An alternative axiomatization|An alternative axiomatization]]'' is undocumented and lacks references. Without a proper citation, it appears to be original research and should either be sourced or omitted.

{{rfcquote|text=
G'day,

I’m the proud owner of what I currently refer to (see chart) as a '''Cattle Dog of Australia''' — a term I use in contrast to the more formalised name ''Australian Cattle Dog'', which, according to my ongoing research, appears to have been coined and formalised by Robert Kaleski around '''1903'''.

Over the past month and a half, with help from my AI assistant, I’ve compiled a working '''genealogical chart''' tracing known and hypothesised breed influences, including several undocumented or lesser-discussed variants. This includes some visual reconstructions where no historical images were available.

My previous discussion thread was titled '''“Genealogy Breed Chart Draft”''', and I’d like to thank @[[User:Traumnovelle|Traumnovelle]] for helping improve the early clarity of that draft. The latest version (as of 24 May 2025) is available here:

➡️ [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dKH8QcsYTxz7zhyOnDj8EbNUtZzUixfu/view?usp=sharing Current Draft]

(''Note: This is still in development. If anyone prefers to print, annotate, and scan it back to me for easier feedback, that’s very welcome.'')
----

''' 🧭 Topics I’d Love Reflection or Sources On: '''

''' 1. Timmins’ Experiment vs Early Hall Lineage '''

Do we have any Australian source that directly compares these two branches or suggests one may have been foundational to the other?

''' 2. The “Cattle Dog of Australia” Terminology '''

I’ve labelled the pre-Kaleski, Bentley-era lineage as ''Cattle Dog of Australia'' in my chart. At that stage, the dogs were still regionally bred, unstandardised, and not known by the “Australian Cattle Dog” name yet. The label is intended to distinguish it from post-Dalmatian/Kelpie infusion lines promoted by the Bagust brothers.

Fair or confusing?

''' 3. The George Elliott Dilemma '''

Elliott’s work is mentioned heavily in US sources like '''ACDCA.org''', but he’s absent from this article. Meanwhile, Thomas Hall (well-documented in Australian literature) is omitted from that same US site entirely.

Could this reflect a storytelling bias, or is there primary source material on Elliott’s dogs in Australian archives that we’ve missed?
----

''' 🔍 Additional Questions (Lower Priority): '''

* Was there a known '''phenotypic variant''' (e.g. coat or temperament) that emerged directly following the '''Dalmatian infusion'''?
* Is there clear consensus that the '''Northumberland Drover''' imported by Hall came from '''England''' and not '''Scotland'''? (Some sources use “border regions” loosely.)
* Despite only 100 km separating '''Smithfield''' and '''Northumberland''', accounts suggest quite distinct working types. Can anyone confirm historical differences in behaviour or morphology?

----Thank you for any insight or redirections you can offer. I believe this type of visual chart — even in draft form — could help clarify historical ambiguity for the community, and I’d love for it to become a collaborative effort.

Best regards and blessings,

'''Guil''' [[User:Guilbrynski|Guilbrynski]] ([[User talk:Guilbrynski|talk]]) 05:01, 24 May 2025 (UTC)}}

Almost all [[WP:RS|sources]] reporting on the article's subject or commenting about it are referring to it concisely and succinctly as the "Sean Combs trial." This title varies across the sources only on the individual's name, e.g. a media outlet might denote it as the "Diddy trial." (A trivial earch unearths a plethora of examples.) Since the whole issue of the accusations for sexual misconduct has moved to its final and decisive judicial phase, and on the basis of [[WP:V]] and [[WP:COMMONNAME]], I submit to fellow contributors the obvious question for their comments:

Should the article's title

'''A''' Remain the same?

'''B''' Be changed to '''Sean Combs trial''' ?

There is ongoing disagreement among editors about which landmarks should be included in the lead image montage of the Perth article. This RFC seeks community input on how best to determine which landmarks are most appropriate or representative for inclusion. The dispute revolves around three landmarks:

*'''Option 1''': [[Elizabeth Quay]] Pedestrian Bridge ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Perth&oldid=1287554044 the current version])
*'''Option 2''': [[Cottesloe Beach]] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Perth&oldid=1287553458 diff])

This source [[Pinkvilla]], which mostly posts box office numbers and entertainment gossip, is considered reliable at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Film/Indian cinema task force]]. I'm posting this RfC here because if I post it at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Film/Indian cinema task force|WP:ICTF]], the result is only going to be in favour of this source. The editors there defend this source with passion. Here is a brief history of the source:

First thing first, here is the disclaimer they give out at the end of each article, as pointed out by the editor {{u|Black Kite}} in a previous discussion here:

'''The figures can be approximate, and Pinkvilla does not make any claims about the authenticity of the data'''

That should say enough but here's more:

Pinkvilla was previously considered unreliable at ICTF and was moved to the list of reliable sources in February 2022 without proper discussion, as seen [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Film/Indian_cinema_task_force/Archive_7#Reliability_of_Pinkvilla here].

The Entertainment Editor at Pinkvilla, Himesh Mankad, welcomed the current admin of their box office section and his associate to Pinkvilla in December 2021, as seen [https://x.com/HimeshMankad/status/1469235093612875776?t=8b-mXlRNYb9FfH02fnK-5w&s=19 here].

In [https://x.com/meJat32/status/1498699613980999681?t=l9JFI_GcsEiEP35b08UqvQ&s=19 this] tweet, the admin of Pinkvilla Box Office confirm that they started the blog Cinetrak and moved to Pinkvilla from Cinetrak. Now Cinetrak is considered unreliable. Although the admin say they have not been involved with it since moving to Pinkvilla, they continue to endorse Cinetrak and call it the "best box office tracking site in South India", even in [https://x.com/meJat32/status/1923531864125386764?t=ltXeGd5hBZrBDwYosPNcig&s=19 this] recent tweet. The box office figures given by Cinetrak and Pinkvilla are also exactly the same for every film. 

Now, it's not as if there aren't other sources reporting on the box office of Indian films. Many sources including newspapers like [[The Hindu]], [[The Indian Express]] etc. publish box office figures. And they do this without citing any of these other dubious sources. If a movie has indeed earned a specific amount of money, then other sources will publish about it, as Indian films are often widely covered in the media.

([[Special:Contributions/2405:6E00:223E:AF6E:A85D:7FF:FEB8:8AC6|2405:6E00:223E:AF6E:A85D:7FF:FEB8:8AC6]] ([[User talk:2405:6E00:223E:AF6E:A85D:7FF:FEB8:8AC6|talk]]) 03:41, 31 May 2025 (UTC)}}

There seems to be new sources coming to light and renewed calls for the description of the party's position to be changed lately, so I thought it would be best to open an RfC to discuss this and achieve a proper consensus. My suggestion is, due to the quantity of sources that describe the party as simply "right-wing", that the article's infobox and lead should be changed to describe the party as '''Right-wing to far-right'''.

This RfC seeks to establish that edits about comma usage should be based on verified rules. All of the sources listed in this thread support the same rule for comma usage when it comes to two full independent clauses. No reference has been provided to justify the comma's removal in the following sentence: "Similar stories go back more than 25 centuries, and 'Henny Penny' continues to be referred to in a variety of media." I correctly added a comma between two full independent clauses with different subjects and different verbs. The clauses have different subjects and verbs, making them full independent clauses.
Examples of how to correctly use commas to separate full independent clauses can be found in these helpful references from sites around the world.<br>
'''American English''':<br>
#1 https://east.iu.edu/student-success/coursework/commas.html#:~:text=1.,cat%20tripped%20on%20the%20cord.
1. Use a comma to separate independent clauses<br>
Rule: Use a comma before a coordinating conjunction (and, but, yet, so, or nor, for) when it joins two complete ideas (independent clauses).<br>
He walked down the street, and then he turned the corner.<br>
You can go shopping with me, or you can go to a movie alone.<br>
#2 https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/commas#place_commas_between_principal_clauses_joined_together_with_a_conjunction
Place commas between principal clauses joined together with a conjunction.<br>
Use commas to connect 2 or more principal clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (‘and’, ‘or’, ‘but’, ‘so’).<br>
If they have different subjects, use a comma before the coordinating conjunction.<br>
Example:
The Senate debated the Bill at length, but the party whips eventually called for a vote.
[‘But’ is the coordinating conjunction. ‘The Senate’ and ‘the party whips’ are each the subjects of a principal clause.]<br>
'''Australian English''':
#3 https://www.swarthmore.edu/writing/commas-0
Use a comma before a coordinating conjunction1 that connects two independent clauses.<br>
CORRECT: I want to major in English, but my mother says it's not practical.
Conjunctions perform many functions, so make sure they're separating independent clauses before you insert a comma.<br>
'''British English''':
#4 https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zfmmtv4#zx662v4
Commas and clauses<br>
Commas are used to separate some types of clauses in a sentence.
Independent clauses that are joined by coordinating conjunctions - and, but, for, or, nor, so, yet - also need a comma before the conjunction.<br>
Malik opened the door**, and** Helen was waiting inside.<br><br>
As you can see from the sources, this rule about using commas before the conjunction to separate independent clauses is not exclusive to one particular variety of English. Nevertheless, [[User:Sweetpool50]] undid my edit without providing any reasoning or explanation other than the abrupt comment "wrong".

Following on from the "Discussion on deleted edits" on this talk page, there are three outstanding [[wp:NPOV]] edits (numbered 1, 9 and 10 under "Discussion on deleted edits") I propose, that thus far I've been unable to get enough local editors to okay. The proposed edits rely on the references that are already cited in the article. I'd be grateful for your comments.

A debate has arisen regarding what is the proper definition for "tank battle" over on [[Talk:Operation Brevity#"Tank Battle"?]]. There appear to be two competing definitions up for selection. Which of the following definitions should be used when deciding whether to classify a military engagement on Wikipedia as a "tank battle"?
:'''(A)''' A "tank battle" should be defined as any military engagement where tanks are employed by at least one side.
:'''(B)''' A "tank battle" should only refer to military engagements where tank-on-tank combat constituted a significant proportion of the fighting.

On June 6, I made a fairly extensive set of edits intended to make the opening section more neutral, specific, and encyclopedic in tone. These were mass reverted by another user. After taking it to the user's talk page, we couldn't come to an agreement. To avoid an edit war, I'd request that other users weigh in.

My edits, and the reversions, can both be seen here.

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&diff=prev&oldid=1294337508

The edits cover a wide range of issues rather than a single theme, but some of the areas that I think it is most important to undo the revert include:

•Giving specific years of Bush's military service instead of vaguely saying "his twenties" and avoiding weird language like "Bush flew warplanes" as opposed to "Bush served in the Air National Guard." "From 1968 to 1974, during the [[Vietnam War]], Bush served in the [[Air National Guard]], though he never deployed to Vietnam." instead of "Bush flew warplanes in the [[Texas Air National Guard]] in his twenties."

•Using clear, specific language like "two major pieces of tax legislation, commonly referred to as the 'Bush tax cuts'" instead of "a major tax-cut program."

•Providing more detail on the 2006 election, as in "Bush's declining public approval contributed to the outcome of the [[2006 United States elections]], a [[Wave elections in the United States|wave election]] where the opposing [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] won majorities in both the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]]" as opposed to "Amid his unpopularity, the Democrats regained control of Congress in the [[2006 United States elections|2006 elections]]."

My preferred solution is to '''undo the revert and return to "Revision as of 02:37, 7 June 2025"'''

{{rfcquote|text=
There is an ongoing disagreement on this talk page[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Roseto_effect#Sourcing] about the sourcing and notability of the article on the Roseto Effect. One editor has argued that there are no MEDRS-compliant sources that explicitly discuss the Roseto Effect and therefore the article fails WP:MEDRS and WP:NOTABILITY. Another editor contends that while the term is not widely used in modern medical literature, the original Roseto studies are historically notable and have been covered in multiple reliable secondary sources (e.g., JAMA, AJPH, Chicago Tribune), and that the article has been updated to frame the effect as a historical concept rather than a current medical claim.

The current version includes:
* Historical peer-reviewed sources describing the phenomenon (Stout et al. 1964; Egolf et al. 1992)
* Modern scholarly analysis of the Roseto case (Coste & Glatron 2024)
* Systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the general relationship between social cohesion and cardiovascular health, used to contextualize (not synthesize) the broader topic

It does not include (but has previously):
* A 2024 preprint critique of the original Roseto effect research (clearly labeled as such)

Question: Is the current version of the article (as of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roseto_effect&oldid=1289279772]) appropriately framed and sourced under Wikipedia policy? If not, what changes would you recommend — merging, renaming, restructuring, or something else?

{{rfcquote|text=
I am requesting an RFC on whether recent peer-reviewed research on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can be proportionally reflected in the article's lead to better comply with WP:NPOV, WP:RS, WP:DUE, and WP:SUMMARY.

The current lead heavily emphasises the pseudoscientific status of TCM while minimising the existence of a growing body of high-quality academic literature exploring physiological mechanisms (such as gut microbiota interactions, neuroimmune pathways, and systems biology models), published in RS-compliant journals.

I proposed limited, policy-compliant updates to reflect the existence of such research without making efficacy claims or violating WP:MEDRS. 

My proposed sources include:

- The New England Journal of Medicine (Eisenberg et al. 1993, doi:10.1056/NEJM199301283280406) 

- The Lancet (Tang et al. 2008, doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61354-9) 

- Pharmacology & Therapeutics (Yuan & Lin, 2000) 

- Frontiers in Pharmacology (Li et al. 2020, Zhou et al. 2021) - NCCIH (official NIH center on complementary medicine)

A full discussion and dispute resolution process has already occurred at the DRN: [[Wikipedia:Dispute resolution noticeboard#Traditional Chinese Medicine|Link to DRN filing]]

I am requesting community input to determine whether limited neutral inclusion of these RS sources is appropriate under existing policy.

Thank you. [[User:YellowFlag|YellowFlag]] ([[User talk:YellowFlag|talk]]) 10:27, 9 June 2025 (UTC)}}

There have been questions about what a proper name is and how it is identified. There seem to be different problems with objects, actions, and maybe ideas. I am going to start with "objects" here, they are simpler. Others can expand to actions.
 
Simply, could a manufacturer create a name for an object they make using their choice of letters and generic words in either upper or lower case? What Reliable Source is needed to show what the object's proper name is?
 
* Possible spellings: Acme Shovel - Acme SHOVEL - Acme shoVel - Acme shovel - acme shovel.
 
* Possible sources: - Name on object - Name in company document - Name in government document - Name in sources used - Name in potential sources - Name used most often (Commonname).
 
:: To start things going, my ''opinion'' (I will not take a position): A manufacturer can name its product whatever it wants. Any copyright or trade-mark problem is the manufacturer's unless it affects Wikipedia "legallty".
 
:: For sources, (always "most") company documents. Government documents. Any RS used in the article. No image of object, even if a proper name is clearly visible (images are almost never RS).
 
:: Any source "against" a proper name must specifically exclude it. Simply not using the proper name doesn't mean that it isn't a proper name. A word can be used both as a proper name and generically in the same source.
 
To be clear, I am not asking about MOS grammar, or when to use a proper name, only what a proper name is.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should the provision [[MOS:POSTNOM]] (under [[WP:MOSBIO]]) that allows [[post-nominal letters]] only outside the <u>'''''LEAD SENTENCE'''''</u> be overturned, maintained, or modified? Specifically, the guideline currently reads: {{tq|"When the subject of an article has received honours or appointments issued either by the subject's state of citizenship or residence, or by a widely recognized organization that reliable sources regularly associate with the subject, post‐nominal letters may be included in any part of the article other than the lead sentence."}} Obviously, this RfC would also invite alternative solutions, etc. I will add options if so-requested. As such;

*'''Option 1''': ''Full Reversal of the Exclusion''
**Overturn the existing guideline entirely so that post‐nominal letters may be included in the lead sentence. Order will be determined by awarding-nation's order of precedence (I.e. the higher-ranking award is listed first after the name). If one award is from one nation, and the second award is from another nation, list them in chronological order of receipt (assuming they do not recognize each other, such as Commonwealth awards).
*'''Option 2''': ''Maintain MOS:POSTNOM As-Is''
**Maintain existing guidelines.
*'''Option 3''': ''Conditional Inclusion Based on Infobox Presence''
**Allow post‐nominal letters in the lead sentence only when an infobox is absent. If an article provides an infobox, then post‐nominals should be confined there (with full details in the body text '''''OTHER THAN THE LEAD SENTENCE''''').
*'''Option 4''': ''Partial Inclusion with Limits''
** Allow a limited number of post‐nominal letters (for example, one or two of the most important honors) to remain in the lead sentence, with any extra post‐nominals moved into the infobox or detailed in the article body. Order will be determined by awarding-nation's order of precedence (I.e. the higher-ranking award is listed first). If one award is from one nation, and the second award is from another nation, list them in order of receipt (assuming they do not recognize each other, such as Commonwealth awards).
*'''Option 5''': ''Open-Ended Policy''
**Refrain from requiring ''or'' excluding post-nominals within the guidelines. Refrain from limiting the number of post-nominals in either the lead, body, or infobox. Require consensus on an article-by-article basis on their relevant Talk pages (if-so required).

AGAIN, THIS PERTAINS TO THE <u>'''''LEAD SENTENCE'''''</u> OF AN ARTICLE. 

EDIT: the order of precedence stuff can probably be ignored.<br />
EDIT 2: For transparency, I have attempted to manually ping each participant in the original discussion. I apologize if I missed you, it was a long discussion and my thumbs and eyes grow weary.

This RfC invites discussion on whether excluding post‐nominals from the lead remains justified, or if a revision is warranted given concerns about clarity, consistency, and the conveyance of useful information. [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Biography#MOS:POSTNOM|The original discussion]] was not an RfC proper, and as such, I have taken it upon myself to start one. The discussion was productive enough that I feel it warranted an RfC. This is my first RfC, so, I apologize in advance for any mistakes.

This list has been tagged for original research cleanup for eight years now. The criteria section is completely unreferenced, seemingly encouraging [[WP:OR|original research]] - instead of being consistent with the lists on the rest of the encyclopedia and depending on [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], it creates this sort of a hodgepodge of various claims. Its basic definition also contradicts the non-list main article on the topic (see [[#definition of separatist|above]]).

There don't seem to be any [[WP:NLIST|sources to the list as a whole]], it's mostly [[WP:NOTNEWS|newspaper articles]] about individual possibly qualifying items. Given how relatively easy it is to get a political claim published in a newspaper these days, this is a really shoddy basis for an encyclopedia article.

There's a fairly consistent formatting about how some "people" or "ethnic group" has separatist movements, but there's no nuance to it, which may well lead the average reader to [[WP:UNDUE|arbitrary conclusions]] about the notability or significance of each of these.

There's a consistent stream of complaints on the Talk page that have been getting largely ignored for many years now.

I think this RfC is pretty much needed to decide the design of infobox. Looking at the above [[Talk:2025 India–Pakistan conflict/Archive 6#Indian casualties (third party)|discussion]], I have encountered reluctant opinions to go with my proposal, but if not trivially then it could be done with general consensus here. The Independent sources hold indefinite and varying values of the Indian casualties:
*[https://observers.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20250512-india-pakistan-conflict-rafale-fighter-jets-shot-down-images-debunked France 24 (Debunking other losses but consonant with one Rafale loss)]: {{tq|Only one French aircraft may have been shot down.}} 
*[https://www.reuters.com/world/pakistans-chinese-made-jet-brought-down-two-indian-fighter-aircraft-us-officials-2025-05-08/ Reuters(Based on unknown US officials and written in jargon tone)]: {{tq|A top Chinese-made Pakistani fighter plane shot down at least two Indian military aircraft on Wednesday, two U.S. officials told Reuters, marking a major milestone for Beijing's advanced fighter jet...Another official said at least one Indian jet that was shot down was a French-made Rafale fighter aircraft.}}
*aje dot io slash a5inmx Al Jazeera: {{tq|Reuters news agency also reported, citing four government sources in Indian-administered Kashmir, that three fighter jets crashed in the region. Reports in CNN said that at least two jets crashed, while a French source told the US outlet that at least one Rafale jet had been shot down.}}
*[https://www.barrons.com/news/three-indian-fighter-jets-crashed-on-home-territory-cause-unknown-indian-security-source-c8d544c0 AFP (Another unknown source with no hard evidence)]: {{tq|Three Indian fighter jets crashed on Wednesday on home territory, a senior Indian security source said, without giving the cause.}}
*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/05/09/fighter-jets-india-pakistan-attack/ The Washington Post (Evidence based report)]: {{tq|India’s air force appears to have lost at least two fighter jets, including one of its most advanced models, during attacks Wednesday morning on sites in Pakistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir, according to a review of visual evidence by The Washington Post.}}
Given the above explanation, what should be the statement in the infobox "Third party claim"?
#'''Option 1''': 1—3 aircraft shot down or lost. 
#'''Option 2''': Omit from infobox. 
#'''Option 3''': 3 aircraft shot down or lost. [[User:Rightmostdoor6|Rightmostdoor6]] ([[User talk:Rightmostdoor6|talk]]) 08:15, 19 May 2025 (UTC)}}

== Background '''

: ''[[Special:PermanentLink/1296464986#Adding checkuser-temporary-account to rollbackers and NPP folks|Discussion]] preceding this RfC and ongoing discussion about the intersection of TAIV and other user rights.''
:''See also [[:mw:Trust and Safety Product/Temporary Accounts/FAQ|this FAQ]].''

The WMF is removing public access to IP addresses and replacing them with [[:mw:Trust and Safety Product/Temporary Accounts|temporary accounts]]. (This will not affect visibility of IP addresses or edits from before implementation.) Temporary accounts are tied to [[browser cookie]]s, which are set to expire three months from the first edit. This means that they will be different across [[web browser]]s and devices. The WMF has determined that temporary accounts are necessary to protect user privacy and comply with legal requirements, while maintaining the ability to edit Wikimedia sites anonymously.

The WMF has also created a new user right for [[foundation:Policy:Wikimedia Access to Temporary Account IP Addresses Policy|access to temporary account IP addresses]], which has come to be known as temporary account IP-viewer (TAIV). The minimum criteria for editors (other than functionaries, 'crats, and admins) seeking the user right are:

# minimum account age of 6 months and 300 edits;
# specifically applying for access;
# opting in for access via Special:Preferences; and
# "[a]gree[ing] to use the IP addresses in accordance with these guidelines, solely for the investigation or prevention of vandalism, abuse, or other violations of Wikimedia Foundation or community policies, and understand[ing] the risks and responsibilities associated with this privilege".

Activation and use of the right will be [[WP:log|log]]ged.

Users who are site-blocked will lose the user right. [[:meta:Steward|Steward]]s may revoke the right upon request at [[:meta:Steward requests/Permissions#Removal of access]] "if the user is determined to have misused the temporary account IP addresses or local community consensus dictates removal."

''' Questions '''

'''Question 1''': Should we adopt the minimum or heightened standards for TAIV? If the latter, please specify.

'''Question 2''': Should we authorize any of the following actors to request removal of TAIV upon evidence of misuse of the right?
* '''Option A''': the Arbitration Committee or its delegates
* '''Option B''': a consensus of (i) functionaries, (ii) 'crats, or (iii) admins
* '''Option C''': individual (i) functionaries, (ii) 'crats, or (iii) admins

''' Survey (Question 1) '''

* '''Option 1A''': (i) 500 edits/6 months and (ii) a demonstrated need for TAIV, as evidenced by counter-vandalism work, participation in NPP or AfC, sock hunting, etc. You should at least have extended confirmed to get this user right. The demonstrated need requirement is to ensure editors have a good track record and prevent abuse up front. I do not believe that we need to specify that editors should not be blocked or banned because I think that should usually be heavily weighed against an editor seeking any permission.

{{rfcquote|text=
In 2014, there was [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (definite or indefinite article at beginning of name)/Archive 2#RfC|an RfC]] about using definite articles to achieve natural disambiguation. I have copied the proposal almost exactly below (only fixing some links that have changed since then), although I would urge all participants to read the RfC itself. 
:Is putting "The" at the beginning of an article title an acceptable innovation for [[WP:NATURAL]] [[Wikipedia:D|disambiguation]]?
:Context: Recently, [[Talk:Hulk/Archive 6#Requested move|a move request]] at [[Hulk (comics)]] to [[Hulk (disambiguation)|Hulk]] resulted in a "no consensus" close. Multiple editors, while perhaps opposing the proposed move, suggested moving [[Hulk (comics)]] to [[The Hulk]] instead (as [[The Hulk]] already redirects there). [[User:Tenebrae|One editor]] intelligently noticed that [[WP:THE]] currently is directly opposed to that, as per its dictum that [[The Joker]] redirect to [[Joker (comics)]], and not vice-versa. But should that be the case?
:Please respond '''support '''if you believe adding "the" is OK in order to disambiguate.
:Please respond '''oppose '''if you think adding "the" should not be allowed, as is currently the case.
:Thanks for helping Wikipedia. 
For additional context, the article currently located at [[Hulk]] was then at [[Hulk (comics)]]. 

The RfC was closed as follows: 
:Result: '''The definite article may be used to disambiguate articles in certain circumstances.'''
:There were 8 supports and 4 opposes. One oppose was based on the objection that the DABNAME guidance would be affected, but how this was the case was not explained and it doesn't seem true to me (nothing stemming from what has been discussed here would mean we would not retain the DAB page [[Hulk (disambiguation)|Hulk]], for example). A second oppose was made on the basis that "the" should only be used if it is part of the formal name of the article subject. However, that argument seems contrary to [[WP:COMMONNAME]]. A third oppose suggests that "the" is insufficient disambiguation because we use it in many articles. I can't work out if there is a typo in the comment or not, but this doesn't make sense to me as an argument. The fourth oppose was on the basis that it would be confusing. I don't think any of these are knockout arguments, and so the numerical victory of the supports should be recognised.
:There also seems to be consensus that the applciation of the principle should be resticted to article titles where there is genuine natural disambiguation (e.g. one this is commonly called "The Foo", the other is called "Foo" and not normally "The Foo") and a genuine need for disambiguation. There also seems to be consensus that a case-by-case approach should be taken and common sense applied to avoid unnecessary confusion, and so that conflicting considerations can be taken into account.
To the best of my knowledge, no change was ever implemented after the closure of that RfC, and it has not been overturned or overruled by a subsequent RfC. 

Should [[WP:THE]] include some language that indicates that use of a definite article to achieve natural disambiguation is acceptable? 

An example of proposed language (although this is open to change) could be something like this as a third condition, after the first two listed:
:3. Use of definite articles is acceptable as a form of natural disambiguation, if the article is not the primary topic for the article title without parenthetical disambiguation.
Here are some articles whose titles might be different if this were to pass (all of these have redirects in the format of "the x"): 
:[[Charleston (dance)]] → [[The Charleston]]
:[[Madonna (art)]] → [[The Madonna]]
:[[Roundhouse (venue)]] → [[The Roundhouse]]
:[[Penguin (character)]] → [[The Penguin]]
:[[Politics (Aristotle)]] → [[The Politics]]

I propose that professional players should be added to a player category when they are under contract and are on the official roster as listed on the league website, to align with when we would change the language in the article lead to say they play for their new teams. Players under contract but on LTIR or other non-roster status should not be added to the team category if they have not played for the team. An example is [[Shea Weber]], whose contract has been traded multiple times after his last game appearance. For players on two-way NHL contracts who have not played for that team before, wait until the player is on the opening-day roster. Amateur players such as NCAA or junior hockey players should not be added to player categories until they have played a game for the respective team due to the lack of binding contracts.

Sorry I'm not really sure what the correct procedure is for this. I tried just asking above but nobody replied for over a week. This page worries me somewhat and I'm trying to find some people who might be able to help improve it.

It seems inappropriate to group everything into a bikie gang or an ethnic group. There are a few criminal gangs or violent political groups that are centred on a particular culture or ethnic group, but whoever started this page seems to have tried to sort everything that way.

A lot of the labels, and even the groups themselves, aren't locally relevant. Australians don't tend to group Spanish and Portuguese speakers from opposite sides of the Atlantic as a group, other than possibly "immigrants", the "Hispanic" concept is an American thing.

I'm not sure if everything in the white supremacist group is actually a white supremacist gang, some might be all white just by chance or locality, since that's the largest demographic in Australia.

Hey all, I came across a piece of information that might be relevant for inclusion in the article, I was thinking of saying something along the lines if relevant as — (During his tenure as mayor of San Diego, Joshua Bean was involved in a controversial transaction in which he attempted to transfer ownership of City Hall and portions of the city’s pueblo lands to himself and Lieutenant Cave J. Couts. Although the legality of the sale was disputed, the property was ultimately restored to the city.)

However, the only source I’ve located so far is from the San Diego Police Historical Association Museum, which seems to have drawn from the Wikipedia article on [[Joshua Bean]] itself: http://www.sdpolicemuseum.com/Joshua-Bean.html. So, as of now, it may be circular. If anyone can help locate a primary or third-party source to substantiate this, it could strengthen the article.

Should the article on Kusaila include one of the available photographs of the modern (reinstalled) statue located in Bouhmama, Algeria, as the lead image?

There are two freely licensed photographs of the statue:
* A wider, uncropped version: [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kusaila_Statue1.jpg]
* A more tightly cropped version: [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kusaila_Ibn_Malzam.jpg]

Both are images of a modern public monument commemorating Kusaila, and have been proposed as alternatives to a previously used fictional drawing: [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aksel_(cropped).jpg], which was removed due to sourcing concerns. This RfC seeks input on whether either image should be used, and if so, which version is more appropriate.

{{rfcquote|text=
I'm starting this RfC after a dispute came to the suggestion to start an RfC on whether to convert Lee Jae-myung's and other former South Korean presidents' series sidebars to navboxes for the bottom of articles. This is primarily dealing with interpretation of [[MOS:SANDWICH]], which says that one should avoid sandwiching text horizontally between two images, or between an image and an infobox, navigation template, etc. For the dispute of concern, see [[Template talk:Lee Jae-myung series#Convert to navbox for bottom]], which also got a [[WP:3O|third opinion]]. As of this RfC being started, the presidential seal and signature have been removed from the template, and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ALee_Jae-myung_series&diff=1294044701&oldid=1294043754 an attempt to restore them was reverted].
#'''Keep''': Keep the series sidebars unchanged.
#'''Remove images''': Remove the presidential seal and signature found on the bottom of series sidebars.
#'''Convert to navbox''': Convert to a navbox for the bottom of related articles.

{{rfcquote|text=
There is currently an impasse between several editors (including myself) on the topic of how to display an aircraft's specifications if there are several variants. For instance, the Boeing 737 Classic generation has 3 variants: The -300, -400, and -500. On several existing pages, these variants and their specifications (Such as range, physical dimensions, engine types, etc.) are listed in a large table which encompasses either the entire family of aircraft (See [[Boeing 747#Specifications]]) or for the specific generation (See [[Boeing 737 MAX#Specifications]]). However, under the Style guide these should be a single variant in a list (See [[Boeing 737 Next Generation#Specifications (Boeing 737-800 with CFM56-7B26 and winglets)]]) to minimize the amount of extraneous data. 

The disagreement comes in with which one should be used. The side I am on argues the tables give the most complete view of the variants while providing a quick reference lookup for data within the article. The side for the guidelines in the style argues that the tables violate [[Wikipedia:INDISCRIMINATE]] due to being too information dense, and that the singular variant model is more readable and better for reader understanding. 

My request for comment is whether '''We should follow the style guide''', or '''We should use the existing data tables.''' [[User:Bimmons|Bimmons]] ([[User talk:Bimmons|talk]]) 04:16, 6 June 2025 (UTC)}}

This is a formal Request for Comment regarding the lead sentence of the *Islamism* article. While discussion is ongoing above, I believe wider input is needed on the framing and definition of "Islamism" in the article's opening line. Please see full discussion and sources above. Summary of proposed change below:

Current lead:  
> ''Islamism is a range of religious and political ideological movements that believe that Islam should influence political systems.''

Proposed lead:  
> ''Islamism is a modern political term used to describe a range of ideological movements that seek to implement Islamic principles in government and public policy. The term is not found in classical Islamic texts and is used with varying meanings in academic and political discourse, often contested by those it is applied to.''

Do editors agree with revising the lead along these lines?

Some users have argued that the source is [[WP:PRIMARY]], and that it is therefore against Wikipedia's guidelines to use it to claim empirical proof of controversial claims, such as "The false idea that misandry is commonplace among feminists is so widespread that it has been called the 'misandry myth' by 40 topic experts" and "feminist views of men were no different than that of non-feminists or men towards men." Other users have argued that the source is [[WP:SECONDARY]], and that it is therefore fine to include. Additionally, some users have argued that calling the authors "40 topic experts" is not adequately supported, while other users feel that being author of an academic article is enough reason to be called a "topic expert."

During late 2024 to early 2025, there has been a tendency from multiple users (mostly IP and/or recently-created accounts) to add composition bars to the "Status in legislature" field in the infoboxes of cabinet/government-related articles. This situation has resulted in a number of issues that need to be addressed. Researching on this matter, I have found hardly any discussion or substantial input on this issue, meaning there is no explicit consensus for this (in fact, composition bars seem to have been added either unilaterally or in good faith by people who actually thought this was a widely-accepted formatting). Due to this affecting a wide range of articles, I believe a RfC is the most straightforward way to proceed. Thus, the question put forward is: should we include composition bars on legislature status in the infoboxes of cabinet articles, Yes or No? If Yes, how should it be formatted?

{{rfcquote|text=
Of the 7 [[WP:RECALL]] petitions so far, at least three have some concerns at least adjacent to [[WP:INACTIVITY]] - [[Wikipedia:Administrator recall/Master Jay|Master Jay]], [[Wikipedia:Administrator recall/Gimmetrow|Gimmetrow]] and [[Wikipedia:Administrator recall/Night Gyr|Night Gyr]] (ongoing).

Currently admins are desysopped procedurally if they haven't made any edits/admin actions for 1 year OR have made less than 100 edits in 5 years. According to [[WP:RESTORATION]], adminship is generally restored at [[WP:BN]] unless there were 2 years without edits OR 5 years since last tool usage.

Clearly, many editors believe we need to update WP:INACTIVITY but there has been no RFCs attempted on how.

This is a preliminary RFC to ask two main questions -
* '''Q1:''' Do the thresholds for procedural desysoppings ( [[WP:INACTIVITY]] ) need changing? If yes, to what?
* '''Q2:''' On return from inactivity, when do they generally get the tools back? ( [[WP:RESTORATION]] )

I'm hoping this narrows solutions down sufficiently that a future yes/no proposal can gauge consensus later.

Sorry I'm not really sure what the correct procedure is for this. I tried just asking above but nobody replied for over a week. This page worries me somewhat and I'm trying to find some people who might be able to help improve it.

It seems inappropriate to group everything into a bikie gang or an ethnic group. There are a few criminal gangs or violent political groups that are centred on a particular culture or ethnic group, but whoever started this page seems to have tried to sort everything that way.

A lot of the labels, and even the groups themselves, aren't locally relevant. Australians don't tend to group Spanish and Portuguese speakers from opposite sides of the Atlantic as a group, other than possibly "immigrants", the "Hispanic" concept is an American thing.

I'm not sure if everything in the white supremacist group is actually a white supremacist gang, some might be all white just by chance or locality, since that's the largest demographic in Australia.

Should articles about spaceflight missions (e.g., launches and landings) present UTC first and local time in parentheses, or local time first and UTC in parentheses? The current [[:Wikipedia:WikiProject Spaceflight/Style guide|WikiProject Spaceflight style guide]] recommends listing UTC first as space is not within any Earth-bound time zone, while some editors argue this contradicts [[MOS:TIMEZONE]], which prioritizes local time where an event took place.

The goal of this RfC is to determine whether spaceflight articles should make an exception to MOS:TIMEZONE (if such a exception is needed) by standardizing on UTC first formatting, given the global and technical nature of these events. 

Examples of formatting options:
* UTC first and local time in parentheses: June 4, 2022, 13:25:02 UTC (9:25:02 am EDT)
* Local time first and UTC in parentheses: June 4, 2022, 9:25:02 am EDT (13:25:02 UTC)

Hello! This I am made this post an RFC due to the lack of consensus on whether or not the second paragraph of the lead should remain or not.
*The opposition to the current lead have stated that it is inaccurate and/or is from bad faith primary sources (Mona Baker is the main example given) and thus should be removed for giving [[WP:UNDUE]] weight to bad faith interpretations (at least in the lead).
*Editors who are positive of or neutral the current lead do not believe it is biased or that regardless of the quality of the sources of the criticism, that having a criticism in the lead is preferable since it is a notable aspect of organisation (my argument).
I do not believe I have any right to repeatedly revert edits rejecting the current lead when there is no clear consensus on this talk page on what to do regarding it, and that this is a fairly niche article so a talk page trying to solve this issue wouldn't probably wouldn't have much luck compared to the last few times.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should the "Parody of" column '''include''' or '''exclude''' title-only references?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=1100430362&oldid=1100408251&title=List_of_The_Simpsons_Treehouse_of_Horror_episodes On July 25, 2022], [[User:Shivertimbers433]] added a note to the "Parody of" column header, stating that "Properties are only listed if a significant portion of the segment's plot is dedicated to parodying it, and has been cited by the show creators or a review published by a reliable source. Excluded are title-only references and brief jokes." However, this seems to be a unilateral decision rather than a consensus, and I am opposed to the "title-only references" part of this, so I am therefore bringing it up for debate.

My argument in favor of '''including''' title-only references is that readers are likely to want to know where the title of each segment comes from, and so unless it happens to also be parodied by enough of the main content, then readers will be unable to find that information here. Even if other one-off references are excluded (which I am fine with), I think title-only references should be exempt from that because titles generally bear much more importance and get much more attention than brief snippets of main content.

The main argument I assume for '''excluding''' them is that they could cause confusion and clutter, but if we agree on a uniform, concise formatting for them, I don't think that shouldn't be an issue. For example, a possible format could be "<main references>; title only: <title-only reference>", but I'm open to other formats.

{{rfcquote|text=
Hi all,

There is some disagreement over whether the article should state outright that Leo Frank was “wrongly convicted” of murder. While many modern historians believe Frank was innocent and that the case was influenced by bias and misconduct, it is also true that:

* Frank’s conviction was never legally overturned.
* The 1986 posthumous pardon from the state of Georgia did not exonerate him; rather, it specifically condemned the state’s failure to protect him from lynching.
* A total of 13 appeals and motions were filed between 1913 and 1915—including in the Georgia State Appeals Courts, Georgia Supreme Court, U.S. District Court, U.S. Court of Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court—all of which were denied.
* More recent efforts, including a 2019 petition for full exoneration, were also dismissed (in early 2023).
* As a result, Frank’s conviction remains legally valid, based on the original jury verdict in what was at the time Georgia’s longest criminal trial.

Given this, should the article continue to use strong language like “wrongly convicted,” or should it be revised to a more neutral phrasing? For example:

“Many historians believe Leo Frank was wrongfully convicted, though his conviction has never been formally overturned or legally cleared.”

In short, this phrasing acknowledges that most historians consider Frank wrongfully convicted, while also reflecting the important legal context—namely the extensive unsuccessful appeals during his lifetime and the many failed attempts to clear his name over more than 100 years since his conviction and subsequent lynching.

This discussion aims to reach consensus on the most accurate and balanced way to describe Frank’s conviction, in accordance with Wikipedia’s policies on [[WP:NPOV]] (Neutral point of view) and [[WP:RS]] (Reliable sources).

RfCs are time consuming, and Wikipedia being a volunteer project, editor time is valuable. Editors should try to resolve their issues before starting an RfC. Try discussing the matter with any other parties on the related talk page. If you can reach a consensus or have your questions answered through discussion, then there is no need to start an RfC.

If a local discussion does not answer your question or resolve the problem, then some other forums for resolution include:

Asking for input or assistance at one or more relevant WikiProjects, which are often listed at the top of the article's talk page.
Also, "Include an initial brief, neutral statement or question about the issue in the talk page section,"Statements are often phrased as questions, for example: "Should this article say in the lead that John Smith was a contender for the Pulitzer Prize?"

{{rfcquote|text=
A disagreement has arisen regarding whether the Egyptian Arabic template should be applied to names of dishes in Egyptian cuisine articles, especially when the spelling does not differ from Standard Arabic. If I have misrepresented a position, please clarify below. 

Editors are invited to comment on the following two options:

'''Option 1: Use Egyptian Arabic template only when the spelling of the name explicitly does not conform to Standard Arabic orthography'''

The supporter of this view argues that using the Egyptian Arabic template when the term conforms to Standard Arabic orthography and lexicology can be considered nationalistic advocacy. They maintain that the template should be reserved for cases where the term is clearly in vernacular Egyptian Arabic, but that Standard Arabic should take precedence in cases where the two overlap, even if its within the context of Egyptian Arabic.

'''Option 2: Use Egyptian Arabic template regardless of overlap with Standard Arabic (due to shared usage within Egyptian Arabic)'''

The supporter of this view argues that the Egyptian Arabic template is appropriate for labeling culinary items and varieties in Egyptian culture, even if those forms, within the context of Egyptian Arabic, partially or fully overlap with Standard Arabic. He notes that many culinary items have entirely different nomenclature across other Arabic dialects, and as such, their designation as Egyptian Arabic in Egyptian contexts is necessary for linguistic and cultural precision. He notes that even when there is lexilogical similarities Egyptian Arabic has a broader orthographic tolerance than Standard Arabic, often allowing standard and non-standard spellings more capable of reflecting local pronunciation and usage. Thus the template can better reflect these localized forms, as they are recognizable to Egyptian speakers.

{{rfcquote|text=
To give a short summary, I've actually went through all Wikipedia policies and precedents, and everything is quite simple. The album page '''''should''''' have the name "'''.'''" ('''[[MOS:ALBUM]]''', ''"The article name should be the title of the album"''). This is '''in line with all the precedents like such as [[÷ (album)|÷]], [[! (Trippie Redd album)|!]], [[_ (album)|_]].''' Even in complex Unicode cases the rule is upheld: [[While(1 Is Less Than 2)|While(1<2)]], [[Robot Face|<|°_°|>]], [[(A→B) Life]]. The '''only''' example against this (correct me if I'm wrong) is [[Love Symbol]] which isn't a Unicode character in the first place anyway.

'''However''', there is a '''technical limitation''' that '''a)''' Wikipedia page name can't contain a single dot (no such page exists) and '''b)''' per renaming discussion above unlike other single-character album names, a dot is especially technically challenging to serve as a valid reference due to its size and function. So '''page title [[Period (Kesha album)]] is not under question.''' 

My {{Suggestion}} is therefore as follows:
# Introduction as "'''''.''''' (pronounced as '''''Period''''') is the sixth studio album..."
# Template header "'''''.'''''"
# Add the [[Template:Correct title]] per '''[[WP:NC-SLASH]]''', last paragraph (''"Page names '''consisting of exactly one or two periods''' [...] are not allowed. In most such cases DISPLAYTITLE will not work, so '''[[Template:correct title]] should be used'''."'')
Discussion above seems to support this at the moment (4 opinions for this versus 1 opinion against). In principle we can also count all the reverted edits from all the other users. Due to this being a special case and ongoing back-and-forth edits opinions from the wider community are very much welcome.--[[User:Vinokurov Demis|Vinokurov Demis]] ([[User talk:Vinokurov Demis|talk]]) 03:40, 5 July 2025 (UTC)}}

Inviting comments on inclusion of this anaysis by Royal United Services Institute

:In an analysis published by [[RUSI]], Walter Ladwig of [[King's College London]] wrote that India had seemingly "largely achieved its stated objectives". He noted that the Indian Airforce had, in the opening days, showed the capability to destroy claimed terror infrastructure, and for the first time since 1971 had penetrated the Pakistani air defence systems to hit forward airbases – showing a capacity for "coercive precision operations". However, he said that the Indian military's initial silence had ceded the narrative space, leading to an undue emphasis on specific platforms. He said that the Indian operation had set new normal regarding responses to terror attacks, changing the use of force against Pakistan proper from an "exception to expectation". He however noted that fringe actors may attempt to use this to provoke confrontations, and emphasised the need for expanding communication channels. He said that Operation Sindoor should not be remembered as a "dogfight between airframes" but as a "calibrated use of force" designed to show resolve, target terrorist infrastructure, and assert military capability.<ref>{{cite web |author=Dr. Walter Ladwig |title=Calibrated Force: Operation Sindoor and the Future of Indian Deterrence |url=https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/calibrated-force-operation-sindoor-and-future-indian-deterrence}}</ref>

{{rfcquote|text=
Hello editors. Disagreement over the lead section of the Sokoban article has led to edit warring. I'd like to present both discussed leads and seek your input regarding their prose, content, and style.

Please review both lead versions below. Your comments and preference, supported by Wikipedia policies and guidelines, would be greatly appreciated.

'''A) Lead Version A (Video game type-focused opening):'''

"Sokoban is a puzzle video game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. Designed in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, it was first published in Japan in 1982 by his company Thinking Rabbit for the NEC PC-8801 computer. The game was later ported to various platforms and followed by new titles. It became popular in Japan and internationally, inspiring unofficial versions, a subgenre of box-pushing puzzle games, and artificial intelligence research."

'''B) Lead Version B (Specific 1982 game-focused opening, creator not in lead):'''

"Sokoban[a] is a 1982 puzzle video game developed and published by Japanese studio Thinking Rabbit. In the game, the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. It was first released in Japan in 1982 for the NEC PC-8801 computer. The game was later ported to various platforms and followed by new titles. It became popular in Japan and internationally, inspiring unofficial versions, a subgenre of box-pushing puzzle games, and artificial intelligence research."

'''Specific Questions for Discussion'''

'''Overall Framing''': Which version (A or B) do you believe provides the most appropriate lead for the Sokoban article? Specifically, should the lead primarily introduce ''Sokoban'' as:

'''A)''' A puzzle video game type/genre, with details about the first title in 1982 following.

'''B)''' The specific 1982 original video game.

'''Clarity:'''
When evaluating the above, please consider how the words of the lead matches the information in the article. For example, the ai research is about general Sokoban puzzles, not about the 1982 release.

'''Creator Mention:''' Do you believe Hiroyuki Imabayashi (the creator) should be mentioned in the lead and the infobox as a basic fact?

'''Your input and reasoning are highly valued.''' [[User:Carloseow|Carloseow]] ([[User talk:Carloseow|talk]]) 04:34, 8 July 2025 (UTC)}}

It seems that you are trying to remove calligraphy from every Islamic article, and you previously have been warned about it, the MOS part you cite reads "Images containing Islamic honorifics or calligraphy should have a well-documented usage outside of Wikipedia and not be user-generated." First, the part is debated and it doesn't have consensus, "This section is the subject of a current discussion. Please feel free to join in. This doesn't mean that you may not be bold in editing this section, but that it would be a good idea to check the discussion first." (see the talk page), Second, if calligraphy is in thousands of WP articles regarding early Islamic figures i would say theres consensus regarding its use. Third, many of them are digitized versions of actual ones at mosque's.

=== Sentences with long "interposed" subordinate clauses === 

The first sentence of the last paragraph of the "Political views" section of this article -- at least, based upon the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Maher&oldid=1304721387 "Latest revision as of 12:29, 7 August 2025"] '''version of this article''' -- seems (with the help of www.charactercountonline.com ) -- to have about '''58''' words. 

The above sentence (which I just wrote) has -- thanks to the same "charactercountonline dot com" website -- about '''44''' words ('''or''' maybe more, if you count the ['non-displayed'] URL that is the target for the "Latest revision..." [[hyperlink]].) 

As you can see, I am not opposed to long sentences. I am offering this "suggestion" simply with the goal of helping readers "parse" (figure out) what previous text ('''spoiler alert:''' it is "He has addressed his Republican fans") '''goes with''' the words "by saying that..." once the reader finally "returns" -- (like a Fortran subroutine -- perhaps a lengthy one! -- "returning" to the calling program that invoked it) -- from the '''40-word (long)''' "subordinate clause" or sentence fragment saying<blockquote>who have asked him why he after frequently criticizing the Democratic party over the years for various policies and decisions and being "so good in roasting the [[woke]] nonsense-peddlers" won't just " go all the way and join" the right-wing</blockquote>that is interposed before continuing ("resuming") with the words '''"by saying that [...]"''' to finally end the sentence.

''' "Suggestion" for a simple [easy] change === 

I am not "suggesting" moving nor inserting any sentence boundaries, nor changing the order of any of the words. I just think it would make it a lot easier [for the reader] '''to parse,''' if the '''40-word (long)''' "subordinate clause" or sentence fragment (see the <<code>"blockquote"</code>> above) were surrounded by some "white space" and/or some other punctuation. 

That long "subordinate clause" or sentence fragment will probably cause that sentence to require a lot of time -- and '''effort!''' -- to 'parse' or "figure out", if it is left as it appears now. 

It could be set apart by using a "<<code>blockquote</code>><big>...</big><<code>/blockquote</code>>" construct -- just like the <<code>blockquote</code>> shown in the above sub-section of this [Talk:] page section. 

Personally I would be OK with the idea -- in fact, I think it might be a '''good idea''' -- to '''also''' surround that <<code>/blockquote</code>> construct with some parens or brackets ... and maybe even some em dashes (or double minus signs), too... '''in addition to''' the white space. 

''' Just a "Suggestion" ===

Should the following sentence be added to the end of the second paragraph in the section on '''First child sexual abuse accusations and first marriage (1993–1995)'''?

 In February 2003, LAPD detective and pedophilia expert Bill Dworin said the photos "corroborated the description that the boy gave us."

{{rfcquote|text=
I was notified that my edits that created a new section, "Monitoring response to treatment" (see version https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Back_pain&oldid=1306789873 ) were removed. The message I received was "Please stop. If you continue to add unsourced or poorly sourced content, as you did at Back pain, you may be blocked from editing. Please don't use outdated, low-quality chiropractic sources; instead, use WP:MEDRS for this topic."

The article I cited is on PubMed and in my view is the best source as it is the most recent systematic review of a topic that is no longer actively researched. If preferred, I can instead cite an RCT in JAMA, 2015 (PMID [https://pubmed.gov/26461996 26461996]) that used a MCID of 6 in its design and cited an article from 2001 as opposed to the similar recommendation of the Vianin review that I cited and recommends a range of 4.5 to 10.

I greatly respect WikiPedia's dedication to quality, but this may be a case that rather than removing the edit as its content is reasonable, to instead post on the discussion page whether the edit can be improved and/or add a Disputed section tag. I add a second source (or can switch) the citation and note that while the source is from 2001, it is used to design a high quality RCT in a major journal in 2015 (PMID [https://pubmed.gov/26461996 26461996]). Admittedly, I could have proposed my content on the talk page before posting.

While I cited a PubMed article that is not within Medline, the article that I cited is cited by over 50 articles on Medline (combine [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?linkname=pubmed_pubmed_citedin&from_uid=19646379&medline%5Bsb%5D PubMed articles citing the article I cited] with medline[sb] at PubMed. 

Apologies for not including the edit summary.

thanks for your time

User:271rpm said in their revision comments of User:GlowingLava's edit "You first need to reach consensus on the talk page.", it was pointed out by User:GlowingLava that simply mentioning a notable point of disagreement, without altering the main text, is a standard way to resolve editing stalemates and does not necessarily require prior consensus to be proposed. (Do not need to reach consensus, mentioning there is disagreement is not the same thing as changing the main number. This also solves the problem of the ongoing stalemate which is encouraged IIRC.)

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
There's been an ongoing debate on pages for elections in the US about what kind of sourcing you need to move a candidate from the "Filed paperwork" or "Potential" section to "Declared." A lot of editors seem to agree that an [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] filing is not enough, because it is very common for people to file with the FEC without ever actually campaigning. Ideally, we want to cite a news article that says the candidate is running. However, it's easy to find candidates who've filed with the FEC and launched a campaign website but who haven't been mentioned in any news articles. Moreover, some news articles say that a candidate is running purely because they've filed with the FEC, even though the candidate has no online campaign presence and the author of the news article doesn't seem to have reached out to them to confirm they're actually running. In my eyes, there are three proposals for how to deal with this:

1. Maintain the current system. A candidate can only be moved to "Declared" if there is an article from a [[WP:RS|reliable news source]] that says they're running.

2. Allow someone to be listed in "Declared" if they have filed with the FEC or the relevant state/local elections agency.

3. Allow someone to be listed in "Declared" with two citations: first, a filing with the FEC or the relevant state/local elections agency, and second, a self-published source from the candidate that says they're running--e.g. a campaign website, campaign social media account, or fundraising page where the candidate explicitly says they're running (so "I'm exploring a candidacy" or something like that wouldn't be good enough).

Which do you think is the best path? [[User:BottleOfChocolateMilk|BottleOfChocolateMilk]] ([[User talk:BottleOfChocolateMilk|talk]]) 15:57, 25 July 2025 (UTC)}}

Should the Criticism section of the Airbnb article include sourced content discussing allegations of review suppression and its impact on transparency and consumer trust?

Suggested Content:

'''Censorship of Negative Reviews'''
Airbnb has faced criticism for allegedly censoring or suppressing negative guest reviews, raising concerns about transparency and consumer trust. While the platform maintains policies to remove reviews that violate its content guidelines—such as those deemed irrelevant, retaliatory, or containing prohibited language—some critics argue that these mechanisms may be used to remove legitimate complaints. Reports have surfaced of hosts disputing unfavorable reviews and successfully having them removed, sometimes by submitting misleading evidence or citing ambiguous policy violations. Additionally, some guests have reported that Airbnb did not reinstate reviews even after providing documentation supporting their claims. These concerns have led to broader discussions about whether Airbnb’s moderation practices prioritize brand reputation and host satisfaction over transparency, potentially limiting access to honest feedback and obscuring safety-related issues for future travelers.

'''Version A''' [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=July_2025_Central_Texas_floods&diff=prev&oldid=1303703228], While additional funding was made available for the county through the [[American Rescue Plan Act of 2021|American Rescue Plan Act]] of 2021, it was not used for flood warning and monitoring systems. It is unclear whether county officials were aware they could have used the funding for upgrades to their flood warning system. The area is very conservative politically, and many residents were opposed to using the funds for anything at all.  [https://www.texastribune.org/2025/07/10/texas-kerr-county-commissioners-flooding-warning/ Source]. 

'''Version B''' [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=July_2025_Central_Texas_floods&diff=prev&oldid=1304351495] While additional funding was made available for the county through the [[American Rescue Plan Act of 2021|American Rescue Plan Act]] of 2021, it was not used for flood warning and monitoring systems. At the time, some residents were opposed to using the funds for anything as they opposed the requirements attached to federal funds. It is unclear whether county officials were aware they could have used the funding for such upgrades.[https://www.texastribune.org/2025/07/10/texas-kerr-county-commissioners-flooding-warning/ Source]

Questions in dispute are

1) Should this mention political conservatism? 

2) Should it include {{tq|It is unclear whether county officials were aware they could have used the funding for upgrades to their flood warning system.}}

3) Is "some residents" or "many residents" more accurate.

4) Should it mention  {{tq|requirements attached to federal funds}}. [[User:Geogene|Geogene]] ([[User talk:Geogene|talk]]) 15:30, 5 August 2025 (UTC)}}

The lede of the article currently states that “Most critics gave it a negative review, with multiple finding it to be the worst entry in the Star Trek franchise.” There has been some contention about whether this is appropriate or accurate for the lede of the article, but discussion on the talk page ended with no clear resolution. Seeking a broader idea of what is appropriate here. I would also like a consensus to exist next time someone tries to make a change in either direction; I am not referring to the issue of whether the phrase should be in the article at all, here, though that is another relevant question.

For context: [[Talk:Hector_Berlioz#Ref_formatting|The preceding discussion]]<br/>
Diff link: {{Diff|Hector_Berlioz|1309360548|1309348852|here}}<br/>
Succinctly: '''I propose systematically replacing instances that address Harriet Smithson by her given name “Harriet” with her surname “Smithson”''' and applying a small number of copyedits to better use adverbial commas and improve clarity. Rationale: according to WP:SURNAME, reliable usage should favor a subject’s surname where appropriate; a Cornell news item and the Wikipedia article on Smithson itself use “Smithson,” and the editor who made these edits reports that a Google Scholar search found far more independent references to “Harriet Smithson” (~1,130) than to forms incorporating her husband’s name (~137), with no clear primary-source evidence that she formally adopted “Berlioz.” For style/clarity I propose a few sentence-level changes already made in the draft—for example, changing “He never studied the piano, and throughout his life played haltingly at best.” to “He never studied the piano and played haltingly at best throughout his life.”; splitting “The elder son of a provincial physician, Berlioz was expected to follow his father into medicine, and he attended a Parisian medical college before defying his family by taking up music as a profession.” into two sentences (“The elder son of a provincial physician, Berlioz was expected to follow in his father’s footsteps into medicine. He attended a medical college in Paris before defying his family by pursuing music as a profession.”); adding a comma in “At the age of twelve, Berlioz fell in love for the first time.”; and changing “In 1854 Harriet died.” to “In 1854, Smithson died.” — all for better neutrality, accuracy of naming, and readability.<br> 
With these in mind, please do prefix your discussion and arguments with either '''Yes (1)'''/'''No (1)''' or '''Yes (2)'''/'''No (2)'''. <br> Pinging those previously involved in discourse of the matter: {{ping|Tim riley|SchroCat|Fortuna imperatrix mundi|Ssilvers|Cg2p0B0u8m}}<br> Thank you, and have a good day/night ahead of you. :) <br> [[Special:Contributions/161.142.149.36|161.142.149.36]] ([[User talk:161.142.149.36|talk]]) 21:11, 3 September 2025 (UTC)}}

Sorry for the poor title, its the best i could think of and have no issue with someone making a better one.

IP 69.156.104.108 and me + JJNITO are at an impasse regarding 3 sources used for the claim in the ideology section in the infobox that the SSNP adheres to fascist ideology. I removed 3 sources used in the section because I believe they did not actually adquietly explain why they are fascist and merely used it a pejorative term and/or just as a [[truism]], you can see my arguments above.

I cannot convince 69.156.104.108 that the sources are flawed and they are stating that I am [[Sealioning]] and missunderstanding what makes something a reliable source. this argument has gone in circle for days and we need an outside opinion.

{{rfcquote|text=
We had an RFC earlier this year around how to handle LLM/AI generated comments. That resulted in [[WP:HATGPT]] after further discussion at [[WT:TPG]]. Recently, an editor [[Special:Diff/1304748131|started a requested move using LLM generated content]]. I ran that content through two different AI/LLM detection utilities: GPT Zero says "highly confident", and 100% AI generated; Quillbot stated 72% of the text was likely AI generated. 

Should HATGPT be expanded to allow for the closure of discussions seeking community input (RFC/VPR/CENT/RFAR/AFD/RM/TFD/RFD/FFD/etc) that are started utilizing content that registers as being majority written by AI? 

I was tempted to just start an RFC on this, but if there's alternate proposals or an existing [[WP:PAG]] that already covers this, I'm all ears. =) —[[User:Locke Cole|Locke Cole]] • [[User talk:Locke Cole|t]] • [[Special:Contributions/Locke Cole|c]] 00:38, 12 August 2025 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I am an AMPOL editor and I often see articles with party affiliation assumed in the infobox. For instance, [[Adriana Kugler]]'s infobox states that she is a Democrat, but no inline citation is provided. On the other hand, [[Todd Blanche]] does provide a citation for having registered as a Republican. I am questioning the purpose of this parameter for individuals who are not directly associated with politics—in other words, their profession does not pertain to being a politician or political consultant. "If relevant" in the {{T|Infobox person}} documentation is rather vague. The misuse of this parameter warrants some action.

The rationale for removing the party affiliation parameter is similar to [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 126#RfC: Religion in biographical infoboxes|the RfC over the religion parameter]]. As was stated then, "This would be consistent with our treatment of sexual orientation and various other things we don't include in infoboxes that are matters which may be nuanced, complex, and frequently controversial. The availability of a parameter encourages editors to fill it, whether they have consensus to do so or not, regardless of instructions in template documentation to gain consensus first; new and anon IP editors generally do not read documentation, they simply see a "missing" parameter at article B that they saw at article A and add it." <span style="font-family: monospace;">[[User talk:ElijahPepe|elijahpepe@wikipedia]] (he/him)</span> 16:38, 10 August 2025 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The [[WP:MOS|Manual of Style]] varies in [[WP:CONLEVEL|levels of consensus]]. In [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Article_titles_and_capitalisation_2]] it was alleged for some parts of MOS: {{tq|some of those guidelines have fewer watchers than my talk page, and are largely written by parties to this case}} [[Special:Diff/1307322181|(see discussion)]]. Meanwhile, CONLEVELS states: 

{{tqb|Consensus among a limited group of editors, at one place and time, cannot override community consensus on a wider scale. For instance, unless they can convince the broader community that such action is right, participants in a WikiProject cannot decide that some generally accepted policy or guideline does not apply to articles within its scope.}}

I don't think it's unreasonable to conclude that while some parts of MOS are the result of consensus with significant participation, there may be other parts that are indeed {{tq|consensus among a limited group of editors, at one place and time}}.

Also of note are the [[Special:Diff/1306799581|proposals]] by L235 that did not make principles for that case. Specifically, 

{{tqb|Policies and guidelines have a combination of prescriptive and descriptive characteristics. Policies and guidelines document community consensus as to {{tq|"standards [that] all users should normally follow"}} ([[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]]), giving them some degree of prescriptive force. Simultaneously, policies and guidelines seek to describe {{tq|"behaviors practiced by most editors"}} ([[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]]), and change with community practice, giving them a descriptive quality. Naturally, disagreements regarding the extent of a policy's consensus or prescriptive effect arise from this combination, and the text of a policy can sometimes diverge from or lag behind community consensus. These disagreements, like all disputes on Wikipedia, should be resolved by discussion and consensus.}}

'''Does MOS necessarily indicate community consensus on a wider scale?''' In other words, should closers examine the specific text for level of consensus before using it to overrule a (potentially larger) group of editors? <span style="font-family:Ink Free"> Good day—[[User:RetroCosmos|<span style="color:navy">RetroCosmos</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:RetroCosmos|<span style="color:black">talk</span>]]</sup></span> 01:45, 26 August 2025 (UTC)}}

Submission of this draft was declined on 3 September 2025 by [[User:Royiswariii]].  

Royiswariii said the article does not meet any of the eight academic-specific criteria. Here are two such criteria that the article did meet:  See [[Wikipedia:Notability (academics)]]

1. The person has received a highly prestigious academic award or honor at a national or international level.
: Renz received the [[George Pólya Award]] in 1981.

2. The person has been the head or chief editor of a major, well-established academic journal in their subject area.
: Starting in 1961, Renz was the editor of the journal [[Advances in Mathematics]].

Royiswariii said the article does not meet cite multiple reliable, secondary sources independent of the subject, which cover the subject in some depth.  Here are citations that do cover Dr Renz in some depth:

{{rfcquote|text=
I propose renaming the section header from “Pornography” to “Adult media”. This terminology is more neutral and accurately reflects the scope of the section, which covers adult publications and adult television channels—not just pornography.

For context, in reviewing a broad range of reliable sources, including The Guardian, The Independent, Reuters, and City A.M., I found that the majority of coverage refers to Desmond’s former businesses as either “adult” or a combination of “adult” and “pornography.” Only one article published post-2010 uses “porn” exclusively. In at least three cases, “porn” appears only in the headline, while the body of the article consistently uses “adult” terminology, which I interpret as editorial choices for attention rather than strict categorisation.

Based on this research, I believe that “adult” is a commonly accepted and broader descriptor in mainstream reporting, not merely a euphemism. 

The current term “Pornography” carries negative connotations and may inadvertently frame the subject in a pejorative way, which risks violating [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|WP:NPOV]] (neutral point of view). Using “Adult media” avoids these implications and provides a broader, more balanced descriptor that reflects the actual content.

Additionally, framing the section under “Pornography” could be seen as giving undue weight to a single aspect of adult entertainment, raising WP:DUE concerns. It also risks falling afoul of [[Wikipedia:Criticism|WP:CSECTION]], since labeling a section with a term that implies criticism rather than neutrally describing its contents may constitute a non-neutral section title.

“Adult media” is therefore preferable to both “Pornography” and “Adult content,” as it is descriptive, inclusive of the different types of adult-oriented material covered in the section, and consistent with Wikipedia’s policy requirements for neutrality and due representation.

Should the section heading “Pornography” in this article be changed to “Adult content,” reflecting the terminology used in the majority of reliable sources (which often alternate between “pornography” and “adult”), while retaining “pornography” in the article text where supported?

Please indicate clearly whether you support or oppose the change. [[User:MacFleet76|MacFleet76]] ([[User talk:MacFleet76|talk]]) 15:13, 9 September 2025 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The claim of ''Caledonia'' launching with 64-cwt 32-pounder cannon seems dubious... but the only sources I am able to access either don't give a weight for these (lower-gundeck) cannons, or—in the one case—''do(es)'' list such a measurement (but ''also'' implicitly contradicts it). Hoping that, perhaps, an expert might have access to a way to check, or else might be able to say "no bro u dumb it is totally right", heh; see below for more.  

['''Note:'''  ''not sure if I'm doing this right; maybe it doesn't warrant an RfC.  If so, please feel free to remove the RfC tag or let me know & I'll do it.'']

<hr>

I think this may be an error in Winfield: in his ''British Warships ... 1793–1817,'' he doesn't specifically mention the weight of the guns for ''Caledonia;'' '''but''' he '''does''' mention that all post-''Hibernia'' first-rates—which would incl. ''Caledonia,'' I believe—were to have 56-cwt 32-pdr cannon on their lower gundecks... and this ''is'' the standard weight for these (Blomefield) guns.

''As far as I know,'' in fact, there '''was no such thing''' as a 64-cwt 32-pdr, in the Royal Navy of this period; at least, I cannot find such a thing in Douglas’s (1855 4th ed.) ''Treatise on Naval Gunnery,'' nor McConnell’s ''British Smooth-Bore Artillery'' (1988).

And, indeed, these supposed 64-cwt 32-pound cannon are listed '''only''' this single time, in Winfield's ''British Warships ... 1817–1863,'' and '''nowhere at all''' in ''...1793–1817''—so either no other ship ever had 'em, and Winfield forgot to mention them in the previous volume¹...

...or else it's an error.

<hr>

I am struggling to figure out what Winfield might have ''meant,'' though:  if we suppose that the original 32-pdrs likely weighed 56 cwt, and that the 1831 refit replaced them with 55-cwt guns... then the 1840 re-armament is again, apparently, replacing the latter with 56-cwt models—possible, but maybe a bit odd...?

The 63-cwt Millar models might be a possibility for the 1831 replacements—the time-line works, I think (1829 or so being about when they were introduced, IIRC)—but that would require Winfield to have both ('''a''') accidentally transposed the two weights (easily done), ''and'' ('''b''') written "55" when he meant "56" & "64" when he meant "63" (not-so-easily done, perhaps:  off-by-1 errors are less common in humans than in computers, I think!).


Anyway, just thought I'd leave this here in case anyone knows better, or can suggest another source to check (+ I'm working on getting Winfield's latest book in case it's got something relevant). Cheers.

&nbsp;

<hr>

¹:  ''[One might be tempted to say here "ah, but what if they weren't introduced to'' Caledonia ''until after 1817?  that'd explain at least the latter fact"—but can't be:  they're mentioned as'' being '''replaced''' ''in her first refit, in 1831.  Hence, she must have started with 'em—if they existed!]''

I've been wondering what the exact scope of [[WP:NOPAGE]] is supposed to refer to. Is [[WP:NOPAGE]] supposed to be a reason to delete content or determine whether something should be included in another article?  I think that the examples provided in the guideline are narrow in scope and refer to topics in which standalone pages would require too much background context and repeat content. However, I have seen it interpreted in different contexts as a reason to remove notable content altogether.

Sources disagree other Vanessa Kirby's age/dob. The dominant dob in secondary reliable sources is April 18, 1988. There are other sources, however, that give 1987 as a date and articles where her given age is consistent with the 1987 date rather than the 1988 date. Primary source information such as the government registration of her company also favor the 1987 date. The crux of the debate is the tension between [[WP:BLPPRIMARY]] (which favors 1988) and [[WP:TRUTHMATTERS]] (which favours 1987).

There are four options:
# 1987 
# 1988 [per [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vanessa_Kirby&oldid=1310129798]

Request For Comment for the discussion [[Talk:Coptic_language#c-Squatch347-20250922140900-172.91.72.116-20250921003600| Coptic Language Prohibition?]] on the Coptic Language talk page. 

It is a VERY long 49 page discussion in full; I would start reading about half way through where the WP:3O user Squatch comes in for the sake of brevity and summary as everything said before is only either reiterated in more refined form after, dropped, or expanded upon with new sources. For max brevity you may even be able to make do with just the last reply by each of us in the discussion although I'd say the last 2 replies from each might be better. But of course read the entirety if you feel so inclined to see all the evolutions. 

I definitely think Policy has something to say here, and I wasn't sure to also call on History or Language RFC but since this is dealing with the HISTORY of the language I figured that was what made sense. But arguably the more eyes on this the better to ensure prevention of [[ WP:FALSECON]].

Basically we are disagreeing on how to phrase something based on whether a claim regarding the history of the Coptic Language is exclusive to a single Coptologist or more widely held. The particular claim is the order by the Caliph Al-Hakim on the prohibition of the Coptic Language and the penalties for it. The other user wishes to rephrase it in such a way to suggest this claim is a fringe belief by a single academic. I believe should it be phrased more generally as is the status quo as it is supported by the most authoritative work on the topic and several other works with nothing opposing it in secondary sources. 

At any rate this debate has gone on for a week and I'd like it resolved as it is just going in circles at this point and I've spent enough hours on it I think to warrant an escalation and I'm losing faith a resolution is possible as things stand.

Java 25 introduces a new "Hello, world" program:
<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
void main() {
    IO.println("Hello, world!");
}
</syntaxhighlight>
contrasting the traditional, more verbose version:
<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>
While I personally prefer to present modern examples of code as much as possible, it is still undeniable that the second (older) example is essentially ubiquitous in both the literature and any tutorials on the language. Indeed the first is perhaps far more beginner-friendly (avoids having to demonstrate keywords and constructs that are new to a beginner), however it is still far too recent to be accepted as ''the'' Java "Hello, world" program. This is the case on the [[C++]] page, which similarly has a "Hello, world" program that is superseded by a newer version. For this reason I want to gather comments regarding which "Hello, world" program is preferred and appropriate to show. I started a [[Talk:C++#Request for comments regarding C++ "Hello, world" program|similar RfC]] on the C++ page as well.

@[[User:Ymblanter|Ymblanter]] [[WP:RUS]] is not a Wikipedia policy, it is an essay. That has no weight on anything. Especially not when there are countless English Wikipedia articles each of varying Romanization systems for Russian topics. ja is the romanization given by [[Scientific transliteration of Cyrillic]] and has been used for decades, and /ja/ is more correct as it matches the IPA pronunciation of the letter.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Weather|WikiProject Weather]] encourage the use of [[WP:COLLAGE|infobox collages]] for weather with standalone articles?

Brief background: Infobox images are an often-debated topic for weather articles, sometimes leading to edit wars. In fact, [[tropical cyclones]] has an extremely detailed ordering of what image should take precedent ([[WP:WPTC/IMG]]), due to how many edit wars have occurred. Very few weather articles currently contain infobox collages; four examples include [[2020 California wildfires]], [[Joplin tornado]], [[Tornadoes of 2024]], and the very recent [[July 2025 Central Texas floods]]. I am able to locate less than 20 weather articles with infobox collages. Some of the most notable weather disasters only display a single image in their infobox including these five examples: [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[Hurricane Harvey]], [[Hurricane Maria]], [[Tornadoes of 2025]] and [[Hurricane Helene]] (along with [[Effects of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina|Effects in North Carolina]] subpage). According to [[WP:COLLAGETIPS]], "{{tq|The great benefit of collages is that they allow an article to present multiple visuals for the topic. This makes them particularly useful for leads of broad subjects such as many cities, where using a single image could never be representative enough to suffice by itself.}}"

Just in September 2025, [[Effects of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina]] and [[Hurricane Maria]] have both had infobox image debates and edit wars. To reduce edit wars, should infobox collages be more widely encouraged for all weather articles, should they be discouraged, or should be encouraged for certain types and discouraged for certain types?

I'd like to have the following done with this article:
* Change its title to one that doesn't contain "{{!xt|List of entertainment affected}}...".
::The current title is the equivalent of there being an article titled [[List of education affected by the COVID-19 pandemic]] as opposed to [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education]].
* Convert its content into prose like on [[Draft:Impact of the September 11 attacks on entertainment]] so that the new title would be justified.
Earlier this year, I requested that this article be moved to [[Impact of the September 11 attacks on the entertainment industry]], but no consensus had been established, so I'm starting an RfC to continue this debate.

* '''Option A''': Change this article's title to:
** '''A1''': [[Impact of the September 11 attacks on entertainment]]
** '''A2''': [[Impact of the September 11 attacks on the entertainment industry]]
** '''A3''': [[Entertainment affected by the September 11 attacks]]
** '''A4''': Some other title (please specify)
* '''Option B''': Keep this article at its current title and create a non-list article with a redundantly similar scope, titled:
** '''B1''': [[Impact of the September 11 attacks on entertainment]]
** '''B2''': [[Impact of the September 11 attacks on the entertainment industry]]
** '''B3''': [[Entertainment affected by the September 11 attacks]]
** '''B4''': Some other title (please specify)
* '''Option C''': Keep this article at its current title and don't create a non-list counterpart.
I've been wishing for '''Option A''', but I would consider Option B to be a fair compromise. If you're arguing for Option A or B and can't decide on a title, you may simply omit the number from your !vote. – [[User:MrPersonHumanGuy|MrPersonHumanGuy]] ([[User talk:MrPersonHumanGuy|talk]]) 17:20, 17 October 2025 (UTC)}}

Dear Wiki Community, 

I have raised this matter of the serious allegations made against a living person (Bruno Brandão) on the Transparency International Wikipedia page (under "political activities in Brazil") back in 2024 via the [[Transparency International]] talk page. I have posted the matter on WikiProject pages and Noticboards (e.g. the Noticeboard for Biographies of living persons) throughout the last 18 months, but so far the section has not been reviewed / no comment has been provided. I am now adding here a request for comment on the matter. I hope this will lead to a review of the content and a discussion on the matter, considering these are serious allegations against a living person that create a direct risk for that individual.

Thank you for your support with this! [[User:Transparency 24|Transparency 24]] ([[User talk:Transparency 24|talk]]) 13:33, 16 October 2025 (UTC)}}

I recently changed the Outcomes Section from the "Viet Cong suffered catastrophic losses... etc." 

To "Viet Cong suffered significant losses... etc" 

A user reverted the change below. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tet_Offensive&diff=prev&oldid=1312724376

A user had reverted the change, but did not attempt to reconcile the different positions in the last thread. The previous outcome description had no clear evidence or references, and clear contradictions since neither the Viet Cong nor its method of insurgency was destroyed by the Tet Offensive as these results implied. This is inserting a POV perspective which contradicts historical records. 

Reference for the basis for these changes is found below:

"At the end of 1967, approximately 225,000 Viet Cong and PAVN forces were in the south. Despite casualties taken, Viet Cong and PAVN forces numbered 251,000 by the end of 1968. The Tet Offensive had little impact on troop numbers, and the Viet Cong remained a viable fighting force until the end of the war.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Villard |first=Erik |date=2021-03-13 |title=A Controversial Question: Did Tet Decimate the Viet Cong? |url=https://www.historynet.com/villard-tet/ |access-date=2025-09-21 |website=HistoryNet |language=en-US}}</ref>"

Background:
* The main issue with extended confirmed protection (ECP) is that it's trivial to run up edit counts to 500 edits very quickly. Even though most extreme gaming is detected relatively quickly in several different ways, just a few minutes is long enough to seriously disrupt ECP articles, and some accounts slip through even with the new measures we have in place.
* Full protection is not a good solution for this because it prevents editing to important articles and vandals gaming ECP will shift to other pages when their target is fully protected (as happened while [[Donald Trump]] was fully protected).
Revised proposal:
* Update the site configuration so the <code>autoconfirmed</code> group is required before an account is granted <code>extendedconfirmed</code>. It's a small modification to the <code>wmgAutopromoteOnceonEdit</code> setting (see the [https://noc.wikimedia.org/wiki.php enwiki settings]).
* We allow several high accuracy edit filters to revoke autoconfirmed. This is already supported natively. The edit filter managers would also update [[MediaWiki:Abusefilter-degrouped]] to be more general and less accusatory.
* Remove <code>blockautopromote</code> from <code>wgAbuseFilterActionRestrictions</code> so the <code>blockautopromote</code> action won't be disabled when the filters have a high rate of matches (which already happens because ECP gaming happens at a high rate). This will also allow non-administrator EFMs to edit these abuse filters (they can already restore autoconfirmed when a filter removes it so this is not a big deal).
This will help address the biggest problem we have right now with ECP: the 5-30 minute delay between ECP being granted and an administrator at AIV acting on an automated report from one of several edit filters.

Should we state "[[Redcliffe, Queensland]], Australia (or maybe a different specific place in QLD) as this band's origin, since the adoption of the name taking place there per article sources? Or should we state [[Manchester]], England per the inital founding place of [[The Rattlesnakes (1950s band)]]? My view is this was a seperate band, with the Bee Gees being formed in Queensland.

Due to a history of edit warring, I feel an RfC is necessary for community input. It makes sense to leave the field blank if no consensus has been reached yet, but I hope this RfC will resolve it. Of course no individual editor is in a position at this time to fill the field, in my view. --[[User:ImprovedWikiImprovment|IWI]] ([[User talk:ImprovedWikiImprovment|talk]]) 01:13, 23 September 2025 (UTC)}}

Dear editors,

I am opening this rfc to propose the inclusion of a new section in the article. The goal is to provide non-technical readers with a fuller picture of recent developments in the browser engine landscape, including market consolidation and the emergence of independent engines.

Currently, the article is a concise technical summary. However, the most significant story in 2025 concerns the dominance of Google’s Blink engine—often called the “Blink monoculture”—and the related U.S. antitrust case. Leaving this out risks presenting an incomplete view.

I propose adding a new section, “Market Consolidation and Independent Development,” immediately after Notable engines. This order is logical: first readers see the engines, then the real-world context in which they operate.

Should the period of Soviet (and Nazi) rule over the three countries from 1940 to 1991 be reflected in the use of e.g [[Estonian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]] (or [[Reichskomissariat Ostland]], [[Nazi Germany]]) to describe birth and death places in the Baltics, or should simply Estonia (Latvia, Lithuania) be used?  For example: [[Kaja Kallas]], Born 18 June 1977 (age 48) in ...<br>

<small>'''A''' ...</small> [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]<br>

<small>'''A1''' ...</small> [[Tallinn]], Estonia<ref name="Europarliament"><small>[[Estonia]] was occupied and annexed by the [[USSR]] at the time. See, for instance, the position expressed in 1983 by the [[European Parliament]], which condemned "the fact that the occupation of these formerly independent and neutral States by the Soviet Union occurred in 1940 following the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact, and continues". {{cite journal |last=European Parliament |date=13 January 1983 |title=Resolution on the situation in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania |url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/Europarliament13011983.jpg |journal=Official Journal of the European Communities |volume=C 42/78}}</small></ref> <br> 

<small>'''B''' ...</small> [[Tallinn]], Estonia (then [[Estonian SSR|annexed]] by [[USSR]])<ref name="Europarliament" /> <br>

<small>'''C''' ...</small> [[Tallinn]] (then [[Estonian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]]) <br>

<small>'''D''' ...</small> [[Tallinn]], [[Estonian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]]

<small>As can be seen above, on this Talk page of [[Kaja Kallas]], in [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Baltic states-related articles]] and elsewhere, the previous discussions have not come even close to consensus, instead the "votes" tend to split between "extremes" around '''A''' and '''D'''. Hopefully, finding the "middle ground" could be easier around the new options '''A1''', '''B''', or '''C''' (with added footnote and/or parentheses).<br>  

I will not be participating in the discussion. Please note that for many people the words "Nazi", "Soviet" and "occupied" have almost no geographic meaning, however (by strong association with Hitler, Stalin, their crimes, World War II) using them in biographies is inevitably going to seem offensive for many, and be very offensive for some people. Please try to be less offensive, and to not feel (unnecessarily) more offended yourselves.

To be clear, I propose this as an addition to the policy wording, rather than a footnote or guidance.

Wikipedia's role is to summarize what high-quality sources verify, not to adjudicate or amplify unverified abuse narratives. Labeling a deceased person with Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another (FDIA/MBP) necessarily labels the living relative as that person's "victim,' and now indirectly affects a minor child. 

Because these are biomedical and psychiatric assertions, WP:MEDRS applies; because they involve identifiable persons, WP:BLP and WP:BDP require heightened caution. Per WP:V and WP:ONUS, if sourcing cannot meet MEDRS-compliant standards, the material should be omitted. 

Editors should also consider WP:NOTADVOCACY, ensuring the article does not become a vehicle for advocacy or image-shaping, and WP:MINORS, which requires special care when coverage could impact a child. WP:COI is a separate matter, but regardless of who proposes or objects to text, inclusion must satisfy these policy thresholds.

Wikipedia must not function as an evidence vector in real-world legal, family court, or CPS contexts by repeating unverified psychiatric or biomedical accusations as fact.

Question for consensus: Should biomedical or psychiatric claims (for example, FDIA/MBP diagnoses) attributed to or applied to deceased individuals meet MEDRS-level sourcing, given their direct implications for identifiable living persons?

Afriforum describes itself as a non-governmental organisation, which has the self stated purpose of "to call up Afrikaners to participate in public debate and actions outside of the sphere of party politics."[https://afriforum.co.za/en/about-us/] In 2014 Afriforum described itself as a "South African civil rights organisation focusing on minority rights (and especially Afrikaner rights).  [Afriforum] aims to activate the South African civil society to participate positively in the promotion and protection of minority rights outside the realm of party politics. " [https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/MinorityIssues/Session7/Item4/Participants/AfriForum.docx]

It has been argued by everday South Africans that Afriforum is a white supremacist organisation with an alternative purpose.[https://iol.co.za/news/politics/2025-02-04-netizens-want-dangerous-grifters-afriforum-to-be-labelled-a-white-supremacist-group-after-trumps-land-confiscation-claims/] The journalist Pieter du Toit has argued that Afriforum is an Afrikaner Nationalist group (specifically he called them an "emissary of a new form of Afrikaner nationalism". The founders of Afriforum have been accused of aiming to build a "Volkstaat" (a white homeland for Afrikaners within South Africa).[https://thoughtleader.co.za/afriforum-and-the-rise-of-the-new-right/] Afriforum has been called a racist lobby group.[https://www.okayafrica.com/afriforumcivil-rights-organisation-or-racist-lobby-group/178278] In general their description as an organization, and their purpose as an organisation is highly contestable.[https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/3/24/from-south-africa-to-the-us-white-victimhood-knows-no-borders][https://www.anc1912.org.za/afriforums-racist-agenda-fuels-misinformation-on-south-africas-land-reform/]

Should we define Afriforum as a non-governmental organisation with its self-stated purpose and place criticisms of this description later in the lead, or should we describe them differently (whether white supremacist, afrikaner nationalist ect), with a different purpose at the start of the lead.

Requesting input from editors knowledgeable in Buddhist and South Asian art:
{{WikiProject Buddhism}}
{{WikiProject South Asia}}
{{WikiProject Art}}


Hello,  
I would like to request a neutral community discussion regarding the identification of the statue currently described as a Jain image in this article. Upon close iconographic review, the statue displays multiple key characteristics commonly associated with **Pāla-period Buddha sculptures**, such as:

- A clearly defined **uṣṇīṣa** (cranial bump)
- A possible **ūrṇā** (dot between eyebrows, currently obscured by a red jewel)
- **Curly hair pattern**
- **Two bodhisattva-like attendants** beside the central figure
- **Lion-shaped throne base**, symbolically linked to Śākyamuni ("Lion of the Śākyas")
- Narrative reliefs above and around the figure depicting scenes consistent with the **Buddha’s early life or Jātaka tales**

For comparative reference, please see:

- [Bonhams: A Blackstone Stele of Buddha, Pāla Period (10th century)](https://www.bonhams.com/auction/24777/lot/22/a-blackstone-stele-of-buddha-northeastern-india-pala-period-circa-10th-century/)

- [Wikipedia: Uṣṇīṣa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushnisha)
- [Wikipedia: Ūrṇā (Buddhism)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urna_(Buddhism))
- [Wikimedia commons: Seated Buddha, East India, Pala, 10th-11th century AD] (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Seated_Buddha,_East_India,_Pala,_10th-11th_century_AD,_basalt_-_Matsuoka_Museum_of_Art_-_Tokyo,_Japan_-_DSC07189.JPG)

I believe a neutral review by multiple editors could help clarify whether this statue’s description as "Jain" accurately reflects its iconography and historical context, or whether the identification might require revision to reflect Buddhist artistic traits.

Background, currently, we block all [[WP:Tor]] exit nodes such that any user wanting to edit through a Tor exit node would first need to contact a administrator and obtain the [[WP:IPBE]] user right before making any edits. (i.e. convince a admin that you will edit constructively and not sock, which is a much higher bar than typical autoconfirmed). However, currently MediaWiki artificially extends the period of time a user needs to edit for to be autoconfirmed to be atleast 90 day with a edit threshold of 100 edits. This is enforced by the the [[mw:Extension:TorBlock|TorBlock extension]] which was added [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/mediawiki/extensions/TorBlock/+/2e449d91247042e187442bd45671e3d26a5180ca some time in 2008]. Since then, our policies have shifted, in the current day, due to our [[m:No open proxies|No open proxies]] rules, editing through Tor exit nodes are typically always blocked locally (and many times globally). Due to this, the bar for editing through Tor proxies has become "request the IPBE userright" + the aformentioned extended autoconfirmed userright. Given this, I would like to propose that we remove the special extended time period to get autoconfirmed for Tor users, and instead equalize the bar for recieving the autconfirmed userright for both Tor and non-Tor users. -- 14:56, 3 October 2025 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I am seeking requests for comments on the alignment of the pointer asterisk on this page. This was previously discussed at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Computer science#C/C++ pointer asterisk and null checks]] on "standardising code style" across Wikipedia, but essentially no meaningful conclusion was reached: other editors only dismissed the idea of standardising the code. For this reason, I am taking it directly to the talk page to discuss whether we should use left-alignment or right-alignment of pointers.
* Left-alignment: <code>Type* a;</code>
** Proponents of left-alignment will argue that the implication is that <code>a</code> is of type <code>T*</code>.
* Right-alignment: <code>Type *a;</code>
** Proponents of right-alignment will argue that the implication is that <code>*a</code> is of type <code>T</code>.
Left-alignment is seemingly most popular in C++, while right-alignment is seen in older C code (don't quote me on this, this is a rough estimate, but anecdotally I have seen a more even split between left and right alignments in C code). 

I personally support using left-alignment, for the following reasons:
* The page is about data ''types''. Pointers are indeed a type in C, the parser will read <code>int* x;</code> (or <code>int *x;</code>) as <code>x</code> having type <code>int*</code>.
* Continuity with C++, where left-alignment dominates. While C is obviously distinct from C++, the contents of this page just as well apply to C++ and are relevant to it. Whereas in C, there is a more event split between left and right alignment, so nothing would be lost really.
* There are cases where right-alignment can imply essentially meaningless statements. For example, <code>void *x</code> would imply <code>*x</code> is of type <code>void</code>, but <code>void</code> does not have any storage in memory and represents an absence. The use of <code>void*</code> in C is to represent a pointer that may point to any type.
* There are places where the alignment of the pointer is potentially misleading. Take, for example:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c">
struct Link {
    void *data; // data of this link
    struct Link *next; // next link; EMPTY_LIST if there is none
};
</syntaxhighlight>
This could easily be interpreted as <code>sizeof(Link)</code> consisting of <code>sizeof(void)</code> (meaningless) and <code>sizeof(Link)</code>, rather than <code>sizeof(void*) + sizeof(Link*)</code>, which is far clearer due to the attachment of the pointer. This example may be more contrived, but I think that it nonetheless is still worthy of consideration for the reader. Obviously it is fair to assume the reader has some competency in programming, but I do think clarity is best and there is nothing lost in clarity by using left alignment, rather than divergence from some existing standards (such as Linux kernel style or K&R which to be honest has some very out-of-date practices).

I personally support using left-alignment, for the following reasons:
* This article is specifically about pointers. Using left-alignment is better at, for example, <code>int* a</code> emphasising that <code>a</code> is of type <code>int*</code>. This draws the attention of the reader to the fact that <code>a</code> is itself a pointer to an <code>int</code>, not that the dereferenced value of <code>a</code> is an <code>int</code>. Furthermore, pointers are indeed a type in C, the parser will read <code>int* x;</code> (or <code>int *x;</code>) as <code>x</code> having type <code>int*</code>.
* There are cases where right-alignment can imply essentially meaningless statements. For example, <code>void *x</code> would imply <code>*x</code> is of type <code>void</code>, but <code>void</code> does not have any storage in memory and represents an absence. The use of <code>void*</code> in C is to represent a pointer that may point to any type.
* This page is about the general concept of pointers, not pointers in C. Many other languages align the asterisk with the type, including (but not limited to) [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], among others. Maintaining alignment with the type maintains consistency.
* There are places where the alignment of the pointer is potentially misleading. Take, for example:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c">
struct Link {
    void *data; // data of this link
    struct Link *next; // next link; EMPTY_LIST if there is none

There is a dispute among editors, mainly about whether we should include this sentence ({{tq|He has drawn criticism from scientists for promoting dietary supplements and making "errors of fact"}}) in the [[WP:MOS]] or not. I’m against including it in the lead, in order to comply with [[WP:BLP]], which requires high-quality secondary sources, not just quotes from experts in the media. Also, since this relates to dietary supplements, I think [[WP:MEDRS]] applies, and there should be at least two direct and in-depth journal articles covering this issue; otherwise, it would be undue to include it in the lead.

I’d like to get broader community input on this - should we include the above-mentioned sentence in the lead? [[User:Weilins|Weilins]] ([[User talk:Weilins|talk]]) 23:44, 3 November 2025 (UTC)}}

The ''2000 Sino-DPRK Postal Agreement'' mentioned a new pair of exchange offices, "[[Hunchun]] and 元正 ([[Pinyin|Chinese pinyin]]: Yuanzheng)". Extensive searches conducted by several Chinese Wikipedia editors (including me) have failed to find any place in DPRK called "元正 (Yuanzheng)" along the Sino-DPRK border or throughout the DPRK. Later, @[[User:Hehua|Hehua]] discovered that the DPRK village bordered by [[Hunchun]] is called "Wonj(e)ong-ri" (Chinese: 元汀里, [[Pinyin|Chinese Pinyin]]: Yuantingli) and "元正 (Yuanzheng)" is suspected to be a misspelling of "Wonj(e)ong-ri" (or a previously-used translation, but no supporting evidence has been found).

The FULL name of the agreement is:《[https://treaty.mfa.gov.cn/tykfiles/20180718/1531876876988.pdf 中华人民共和国国家邮政局和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国递信省关于加强邮政领域合作的协议]》, or in English: ''Agreement on strengthening cooperation in the postal field between the State Post Bureau of the People's Republic of China and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea''. <small>(I translate the name personally, according to the Article 9 in the agreement, it's only written in Chinese + Korean languages and no official English version was created)</small>

It is hoped that editor who speaks Korean language can clarify this information by searching for the Korean text of the ''2000 Sino-DPRK Postal Agreement'' in databases like [https://db.history.go.kr/ this], or other reliable methods, to determine the intended referred geographic place of the DPRK that named "元正 (Yuanzheng)" in Chinese, so as to establish its standard translation for the English version.

Which image is best to be the new infobox image?

I'm raising another concern regarding the infobox picture, since there's a new picture that outperforms the current infobox image in both quality and size. If consensus is reached, then it will override the previous RfC results on the same matter.

If needed, here are the file names for the files nominated:<br>

Which should we use: A or B?

'''A''': The speech was authored by [[Ralph E. Williams]] and [[Malcolm Moos]] and was foreshadowed by a passage in the 1954 book ''Power Through Purpose'' coauthored by Moos. The degree to which Eisenhower and his brother [[Milton Eisenhower|Milton]] shaped the speech is unclear from surviving documents. Planning commenced in early 1959; however, the earliest archival evidence of a military-industrial complex theme is a late-1960 memo by Williams that includes the phrase ''war based industrial complex''. A wide range of interpretations have been made of the speech's meaning. Looking back in 1985, Williams wrote that he was "astonished" at the attention given to the ''military-industrial complex'' [[sound bite]], saying that it "has been distorted beyond recognition{{nbsp}}... it became red meat for the media".<ref name="ledbetter ch5">{{cite book |last=Ledbetter |first=James |date=2011 |title= Unwarranted Influence: Dwight D.

The question is should all of those be removed? This does not mean that slogans cannot be mentioned in the body of an article, that is another conversation about whether they meet notability and are encyclopedic. My question is purely ''do they belong in the infobox''?

In addition to this, what about mottos? It seems as though they are used rather interchangeably in Infoboxes... [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&limit=500&offset=0&ns10=1&search=insource%3A%2Fmotto%2F+intitle%3A%2FInfobox%2Fi+-intitle%3A%2F%5C%2F%2F&searchToken=1psnqsw0imds6n2qi1aqz9cjr This search] shows at least 72 infoboxes with a {{code|motto}} type parameter. Should some of those be removed? Personally I'd say keep it for settlement type infoboxes, but the way it is used on {{tl|Infobox laboratory}} or {{tl|Infobox ambulance company}}, it is performing the same functionality as a slogan and has the same issues.

{{rfcquote|text=
We need to change the naming convention for elections in communist states. The naming convention, in many ways, does not make sense: the elections, in North Korea, for example, are called [[1959 North Korean parliamentary by-election]]. Does North Korea have a parliamentary system? No, it has a [[supreme state organ of power]] that holds the [[Unified power|unified powers]] of the state. And North Korea is not the exception, but the norm. The communist state election model was formed in opposition to [[parliamentary]], the [[fusion of powers]], and the [[separation of powers]]. In the communist bloc, and in present-day China and North Korea, the term traditionally used is "Election of deputies to the" organ in question, that is, "election of deputies to the National People's Congress" and the "election of deputies to the Supreme People's Assembly". However, in the case of China, this title is problematic: the election process begins at the grassroots and ends with the provincial and other provincial-level people's congresses electing members to the National People's Congress. The entire election process begins at the bottom and goes from each level until it reaches the supreme state organ of power, that is, the National People's Congress.

A more correct, and less controversial title often used is legislative election, as in the [[1984 Soviet Union legislative election]]. But again, that might make it seem like the election process was identical in the US as in the Soviet Union: it was not. I, here, also propose using the formal term used by the communist states themselves: [[1984 Election of Deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] or [[1984 Soviet Election of Deputies to the Supreme Soviet]].

I have several proposals: {{ordered list |list-style-type=upper-alpha

| At the very least, we need to '''STOP''' describing communist state elections as parliamentary. The communist states had [[Supreme state organ of power|supreme state organs of power]] that held the unified powers of the state and monopolised legislative power; that is, let's use the term' legislative' in the article title, as in the 1984 Soviet Union legislative election.

| Take the most radical and correct route. Make clear that communist state elections were different from once in liberal democracies and used different terminology. Follow the WP naming convention, but use terminology used by these states themselves: "1984 Soviet Election of Deputies to the Supreme Soviet" or, for example, "[[2018-19 Chinese Election of Deputies]]"

| Be exceptionally bold, and create a new naming convention for communist state elections: "[[Election of Deputies to the 11th Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]]" (instead of "1984 Soviet Union legislative election"), "[[Election of Deputies to the 1st People's Chamber of East Germany]] (instead of [[1950 East German general election]]), and "[[Election of Deputies to the 14th Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea]]" (instead of [[2019 North Korean parliamentary election]])

| Status quo, but use the name of the overall body where applicable, [[1984 Soviet of Nations election]].

| [[2019 North Korean supreme state organ of power election]], [[1984 Soviet supreme state organ of power election]], [[1950 East German supreme state organ of power election]]. This is logical as well: they are supreme state organs of power, and keeps the structure intact without making it too complicated.

}} What should be transparent for everybody is the lack of consistency when describing communist state elections, which I hope we can all agree is a bad thing... Since they all practised the same electoral system based on electing lower-level state organs of power and a supreme state organ of power.

Should [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (UK Parliament constituencies)]] be further modified to only require "(UK Parliament constituency)" or "(Scottish Parliament constituency)" when there are multiple constituencies such as [[North East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)]] and [[North East Fife (Scottish Parliament constituency)]] and otherwise use [[Clacton (constituency)]] instead of [[Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)]] and [[Orkney (constituency)]] instead of [[Orkney (Scottish Parliament constituency)]]. At [[#RfC on pre-emptive disambiguation in constituency article titles]] there was consensus to move unambiguous articles to the base name such as [[Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket (UK Parliament constituency)]] to [[Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket]] but this RFC deals with removing extra disambiguation when the topic does need disambiguation because of a different use such as a settlement or district.

* '''Support''' it makes no sense to have a title like [[Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)]] or [[Leeds North West (UK Parliament constituency)]]. While it could be argued that [[Leeds North West (constituency)]] would be helpful as it shows its not about the north west part of Leeds the RFC was clearly against that (of which I agree) but I can see no reason why "UK Parliament" is helpful and at least in England few are ambiguous (as opposed to in Scotland) so few would actually need the longer title anyway so consistency doesn't seem a problem here anyway so [[Georgia (U.S. state)]] would be the exception while [[New York (state)]] and [[Washington (state)]] would be more common. In terms of common usage apart from people saying "MP for Clacton" people do refer to "my constituency" by not "my UK Parliament constituency" of which the latter only seems to get 2 results while the former gets lots of results so I don't see how this is even commonly used extra disambiguation when people need to specify them in real life.

Dear editors, 

I'm hoping to get some fresh eyes on a content dispute here. The core issue is whether two major, long-running court cases against Premji, which were ultimately dismissed, should be included in the article.

*   '''My position''' is that they must be included for the article to be neutral and balanced. These cases were not minor; they were covered for years in major newspapers and one went to the Supreme Court. Omitting them entirely feels like a case of bias by omission. 

On Wikipedia, even serving prime ministers like [[Narendra Modi]] have their articles cover quashed legal cases in detail because they were significant public events. I believe the same standard should apply here. The proposal is to put them in a neutral "Legal affairs" section, clearly stating the final outcomes.

*   '''The counter-argument''' has been that since the cases were dismissed, they are "fringe" issues that lack [[WP:UNDUE|due weight]] for a biography. It was the same editor who brought up the Modi rhetoric. 

The content (the legal cases on Premji and criticisms) was removed from the article while the talk page discussion was ongoing, and that discussion has now stalled. It would be great to get a clear community consensus on this. 

Multiple attempts were made to make this BLP promotional, removing anything that's negative. Need some neutral eyes on this please.

{{rfcquote|text=
With the implementation of [[Module:Person date]], all {{para|birth_date}} and {{para|death_date}} values in Infoboxes (except for deities and fictional characters) are now parsed and age automatically calculated when possible.

With this implementation, it was found that there are a large number of cases (currently {{cconly|Pages with invalid birth or death dates}}) where the birth/death date is set to {{code|Unk}}, {{code|Unknown}}, {{code|?}} or {{code|##??}} (such as 19??). Full disclosure, [[Module:Person date]] was created by me and because of an issue early on I added a number of instances of {{para|death_date|Unknown}} in articles a few weeks ago. (I had not yet been informed about the MOS I link to below, that's my bad). 

Per [[MOS:INFOBOX]]: {{tq|If a parameter is not applicable, or no information is available, it should be left blank, and the template coded to selectively hide information or provide default values for parameters that are not defined.}}. 

There is also the essay [[WP:UNKNOWN]] which says, in short, {{tq|Don't say something is unknown just because you don't know}}.

So the question is what to do about these values? Currently [[Module:Person date]] is simply tracking them and placing those pages in {{clc|Category:Pages with invalid birth or death dates}}. It has been growing by the minute since I added that tracking. Now I am NOT proposing that this sort of tracking be done for every parameter in every infobox... There are plenty of cases of {{para|some_param|Unknown}}, but with this module we have a unique opportunity to address one of them.

I tried to find a good case where the {{para|death_date}} truly is Unknown, but all the cases I could think of use {{para|disappeared_date}} instead. (See [[Amelia Earhart]] for example).

;The way I see it there are a few options:
* '''Option A''' - Essentially do nothing. Keep the tracking category but make no actual changes to the pages.
* '''Option B''' - Implement a {{tl|preview warning}} that would say ''{{red|This value "VALUE" is invalid per [[MOS:INFOBOX]] & [[WP:UNKNOWN]].}}'' (Obviously open to suggestions on better language).
* '''Option C''' - Take B one step further and actually suppress the value. Display a preview warning that says ''{{red|This value "VALUE" is invalid per [[MOS:INFOBOX]] & [[WP:UNKNOWN]]. It will not be displayed when saved.}}'' then display nothing on the page. In other words treat {{para|death_date|Unknown}} the same as {{para|death_date}}. (Again open to suggestions on better language for the preview warning).
* '''Option D''' - Some other solution, please explain.

{{rfcquote|text=
At an [[Template_talk:Infobox_person/Archive_34#Residence_parameter|RFC]] in 2019, there was overwhelming support to remove {{para|residence}} from {{tl|Infobox person}} and from {{tl|Infobox sportsperson}}. 

In 2024, at a [[Template_talk:Infobox_person/Archive_38#RfC:_Do_you_support_overturning_the_2020_consensus_to_remove_residence_from_the_Infobox_person_template?|second RFC]] that decision was affirmed and overwhelming agreed to for a second time. 

Given that {{tl|Infobox person}} and {{tl|Infobox sportsperson}} both had this parameter removed, should {{tl|Infobox tennis biography}} do the same. 

For the record and for full disclosure, I initially went ahead and removed it as I felt that the 2 RFCs made it clear that this change was to be made. That removal was objected to fiercely by another editor who felt I had overstepped. I have reverted my change and here we are. 

;A few arguments
* Per [[MOS:IBXPURPOSE]]: {{tq|The less information it contains, the more effectively it serves that purpose, allowing readers to identify key facts at a glance}}
* The "residence" is almost never sourced and is not really relevant to the player's biography
* To quote one editor at the previous RFC, "{{tq|Completely non-educational unless you're some sort of celebrity stalker}}".

This page was tagged as a sitewide {{tl|guideline}} after [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Ireland/Archive 16#RFC: Categorising Northern Ireland under Ireland|an RFC in 2013]].  The RFC was not a [[WP:PROPOSAL]] for guideline status; instead, it was about [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2013 April 12#Category:People by city in Ireland|a dispute over a CFD]].  A couple of participants in the RFC casually referred to this page as a "guideline", and on the basis of their comments, the page was later tagged as a {{Tl|Guideline}} instead of as a {{tl|WikiProject advice page}}.  

The [[WP:PROJPAGE]] guideline says:  {{xt|Some important site-wide topical guidelines, such as [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources (medicine)]], and [[Wikipedia:Notability (books)]], originally began as advice pages written by WikiProjects.  However, after being adopted by the community, they are no longer WikiProject advice pages and have the same status as any other guideline.  When this happens, the WikiProject's participants cede any notion of control over the page, and everyone in the community participates equally in further development of the guidelines. Such pages move out from under their original "Wikipedia:WikiProject {{var|Something}}/" path.}}

I therefore propose that editors choose one of two options:

# Mark this page as a {{tl|WikiProject advice page}}, and leave it at the present page title, or
# Leave this page marked as a {{tl|guideline}}, and move the page to a title that does not refer to WikiProject Ireland.

An [[WP:EF|edit filter]] can perform certain actions when triggered, such as warning the user, disallowing the edit, or applying a [[WP:TAG|change tag]] to the revision. However, there are lesser known actions that aren't currently used in the English Wikipedia, such as blocking the user for a specified amount of time, desysopping them, and something called "revoke autoconfirmed". Contrary to its name, this action doesn't actually revoke anything; it instead prevents them from being "autopromoted", or automatically becoming auto- or extended-confirmed. This restriction can be undone by any EFM at any time, and automatically expires in five days provided the user doesn't trigger that action again. Unlike block and desysop (called "degroup" in the code), this option is enabled for use on enwiki, but has seemingly never been used at all.

Fast forward to today, and we have multiple abusers and vandalbots gaming extended confirmed in order to vandalize or edit contentious topics. One abuser in particular has caused an edit filter to be created for them, which is reasonably effective in slowing them down, but it still lets them succeed if left unchecked. As far as I'm aware, the only false positive for this filter was triggered by {{noping|PaulHSAndrews}}, who has since been [[WP:CBAN|community-banned]]. In theory, setting this filter to "revoke autoconfirmed" should effectively stop them from being able to become extended confirmed. Some technical changes were recently made to allow non-admin EFMs to use this action, but since it has never been used, I was told to request community consensus here.

So, should edit filter managers be allowed to use the "revoke autoconfirmed" action in edit filters?

I would like to propose the addition of a feedback link on new GA and FAC review pages.  
The '''objective''' is to provide nominators with a simple means of offering constructive comments to reviewers, particularly newer or less experienced ones who may still be developing their reviewing skills. I have myself benefited from valuable suggestions left to me by nominators and experienced reviewers.

A sample prototype of the proposed feedback page can be found [[User:MSincccc/sandbox3|here]], where nominators can leave brief suggestions or comments at their convenience once a review is closed. This would not alter any existing review procedures, nor would it be mandatory for nominators or reviewers.

{{rfcquote|text=
This request for comment proposes deprecating the Associated Press Stylebook as a naming authority within [[WP:USPLACE]]. The current guideline ties certain U.S. city article titles to whether the AP Stylebook lists them as not requiring a state name, a practice that dates back to Wikipedia’s early years. However, this external dependency conflicts with Wikipedia’s self-governed policy hierarchy and with the way other countries’ naming conventions are structured. No other national convention relies on an outside publication to determine article titles. This discussion invites editors to consider whether Wikipedia should instead base U.S. city naming solely on internal principles such as [[WP:TITLE]], [[WP:COMMONNAME]], and [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]], supported by verifiable usage data such as pageviews and clickstreams.

'''Proposal'''

Deprecate the Associated Press Stylebook as a naming authority within [[WP:USPLACE]]. Future decisions about the inclusion or omission of state names in U.S. city article titles should be based solely on Wikipedia’s internal policies and verifiable usage evidence.

Replace the existing paragraph:

:"Cities listed in the AP Stylebook as not requiring the state modifier in newspaper articles have their articles named 'City' unless they are not the primary topic for that name."

with:

:"Cities are titled by the most common and unambiguous name used by readers and reliable sources, in accordance with [[WP:TITLE]] and [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]]. The inclusion or omission of a state name is determined by actual disambiguation need, not by external style guides.""

Add an explanatory note:

:"References to the AP Stylebook in earlier versions of this guideline are deprecated. Wikipedia naming conventions should rely on internal policy and verifiable data, such as reader behavior or reliable source usage, rather than on external editorial manuals."

'''Background'''

The current wording of [[WP:USPLACE]] incorporates the Associated Press Stylebook as part of its reasoning for which United States cities are exempt from the “Placename, State” format. This reliance on an external publication is unusual within Wikipedia’s system of self-contained policies and guidelines. Other country-specific naming conventions (for example [[WP:UKPLACE]], [[WP:CANPLACE]], [[WP:NCAUST]], [[WP:NCIND]]) rely only on internal policy principles such as [[WP:TITLE]], [[WP:COMMONNAME]], and [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]].

'''Rationale'''

The AP Stylebook was created for journalistic brevity, not encyclopedic clarity. Wikipedia’s naming standards are designed for reliability and reader intent, not for newspaper copy.
No other country’s naming convention cites an external editorial manual as authority. The United States should not be an exception.
The AP list of cities without state modifiers is dated and arbitrary, reflecting mid-20th-century newspaper familiarity rather than modern global recognition.
Wikimedia’s pageview and clickstream data provide transparent, empirical evidence of what readers mean when they search for a city name.
This change aligns [[WP:USPLACE]] with [[WP:TITLE]] and [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]], ensuring that the same principles apply worldwide.

'''Intended outcome'''

Consensus to remove or deprecate references to the Associated Press Stylebook from [[WP:USPLACE]] and clarify that U.S. city naming follows the same internally governed, data-based principles used for other countries. <b style="font-family:Century Gothic,sans-serif;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px #69b3e7;color:#fd0;">[[User:CR90|<span style="color:#041e42;">TrueCRaysball</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:CR90|💬]]&#124;[[Special:Contributions/TrueCRaysball|✏️]]</sup></b> 18:07, 10 November 2025 (UTC)}}

There is ongoing disagreement about how to phrase the following sentence in the article:
* Current version: "Hubbard established an organization to promote his pseudoscientific ideas about the mind, which he called Dianetics, in 1950." 
* Alternative proposal: "Hubbard established an organization to promote Dianetics in 1950, a system widely described by scholars as pseudoscientific."

The core issue is whether Wikipedia should state in its own voice that Hubbard promoted "his pseudoscientific ideas", or whether the pseudoscience characterization should be attributed to reliable sources in a separate clause. The earlier discussion is at {{section link|Talk:Scientology|Wikivoice}}.

Input from uninvolved editors is welcome to help determine the most neutral and policy-compliant phrasing.

* '''Option 1''': Keep the current version.
** '''Option 1b''': Text should continue to describe as pseudoscience in wikivoice but may revise to clarify whether Hubbard intended to deceive. (option added 09:10, 6 November 2025)
* '''Option 2''': Change it to the alternative proposal.
* '''Option 3''' (please specify): There is some other consideration, and how that consideration may be satisfied. (option added 09:10, 6 November 2025)
* '''Option 4''' Hubbard established an organization to promote Dianetics in 1950, a method that academic analyses commonly/generally classify as [[pseudoscience]]. (option added 17:06, 20 November 2025)

There are currently four general categories of [[WP:GS|general sanctions]] (i.e., sets of special rules or restrictions that apply across entire topic areas):
# '''ArbCom-designated contentious topics''' ([[WP:CTOP]]s);
# '''Community-designated contentious topics''' ([[WP:CCTOP]]s), which were recently formalized at [[Special:Permalink/1324159302#RfC:_Aligning_community_CTOPs_with_ArbCom_CTOPs|this recent RfC]];
# '''ArbCom-imposed topicwide restrictions''' (for example, the topic of [[WP:CT/SASG|South Asian social groups]] is subject to an extended-confirmed restriction; the topic of [[Wikipedia:Contentious_topics/Genetically_modified_organisms#1RR_imposed|genetically modified organisms]] is subject to 1RR); and
# '''Community-imposed topicwide restrictions''' (for example, the topic of [[WP:GS/KURD|Kurds and Kurdistan]] is subject to a community-imposed extended-confirmed restriction; the topic of [[WP:GS/Crypto|cryptocurrency]] is subject to 1RR).

Currently, enforcement requests and appeals arising from categories #1-3 can go to either the [[WP:AE|arbitration enforcement noticeboard]] (AE) or the [[WP:AN|administrators' noticeboard]] (AN), as appropriate. (Enforcement requests tend to go to AE, whereas appeals can go to either venue at the sanctioned editor's choice, as guaranteed by [[Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/Procedures#Appeals_by_sanctioned_editors|ArbCom's procedures]]). By contrast, enforcement requests and appeals arising from category #4 can only go to AN.

The question is: should the community allow enforcement requests and appeals arising from all [[Wikipedia:General_sanctions#Community_sanctions|community-imposed general sanctions]] (including category #4) to be heard at AE (in addition to AN)? 22:52, 29 November 2025 (UTC)}}

After two months of [[Talk:Gaza genocide/Archive 12#RfC on first sentence|discussion]] - consensus was reached to phrase the opening in Wikipedia’s voice that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians. See [[Gaza genocide]]

Should similar wording be applied to this article?

'''Current lede''' : Israel's practices in its occupation of the Palestinian territories have drawn sustained international criticism—along with accusations that it has committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza—from human rights organisations and UN officials.

'''Proposed :''' Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, and its occupation of the Palestinian territories has drawn sustained international criticism; experts, human-rights organisations and UN officials have described them as war crimes and crimes against humanity.[[User:Cinaroot|Cinaroot]] ([[User talk:Cinaroot|talk]]) 05:54, 4 November 2025 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I feel like we need to gather broad consensus for what we should talk about under this topic. Over the years, this talk page has had loads of topics saying "it's not a conspiracy theory" to which people reply "yes it is, because sources says so". Therefore, let me state very clearly that my intention of this RFC is '''''not'' to discuss the article's sourcing''', be it what they say nor which are reliable. Instead, I want to create consensus for '''what the article should be about''' –  in other words, what text and topic should be discussed inside a Wikipedia article titled "Dead Internet theory"?
 
There is really 2 theories here – the sentiment "bot activity online is drowning out humans and [[Appeal to emotion|it feels depressing]]" and the sentiment "bot activity online is [[brainwashing]] by {{small caps|[[In-group and out-group|them]]}} to [[New World Order conspiracy theory|control the world]]". And although both theories are generally referred to with the article title, they are extremely different in terms of what they propose, how they came about, and what emotions are targeted by their respective theorists. One is rooted in [[anti-AI]] and general [[doomerism]] which are quite recent phenomena, and the other is a renewed phrasing of the good-ol' "evil people are secretly controlling us" which is as old as antisemitism.
 
As such, I don't believe it works very well to describe the two in interwoven prose as if they were equal. For example, the topic named "[[New World Order (disambiguation)|New World Order]]" has been split across several articles, including [[New world order (politics)|the political sense]] and [[New World Order conspiracy theory|the conspiratorial sense]]. Similarly, [[brainrot]] is a separate topic from [[brainwashing]] although the two concepts largely present the same methodology. And as a third, and blatantly more obvious example, we don't talk about [[goyslop]] in [[Criticism of fast food]].
 
So we should pick one and only one topic to discuss in this article. And it should be whatever the [[WP:COMMONNAME]] of "Dead Internet theory" is used for, as to be determined by the community. <small>By my personal unsourced observation, the by far most prominent topic of the two is the anti-AI one.</small>
 
How to accomplish this and what to do with the other topic should also be a point of debate – we could [[WP:SPLIT|split]] or [[WP:SPINOFF|fork]] it off into a separate article, we could put it under its own heading here, we could deem it [[WP:NOT|not within project scope]] and delete it, or do something completely different. Let’s hear it.
 
{{quote|My personal opinion of how to resolve this: '''Contentfork''' this article into its two constituent topics, perhaps titled [[Dead Internet theory]] and [[Dead Internet conspiracy theory]]. They are separate topics that both deserve coverage but should be covered separately. Any actual overlap between the two may be described in the destination articles. If the community supports this path, I'd be happy to start writing towards it myself.}} [[User:Rose Abrams|<span style="color:#0000ff;">Rose Abrams</span>]] ([[User talk:Rose Abrams|T]] [[Special:Contributions/Rose Abrams|C]] [[Special:Log/Rose Abrams|L]]) 12:36, 4 November 2025 (UTC)}}

Following a CfD for categories relating to British sportspeople in 2023 [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2023 December 28#Britsh sportspeople by descent|'''here''']], followed by those for several other groupings nominated by myself in September 2025 [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2025 September 3#American sportspeople by country of descent|'''here''']], all of which resulted in upmerging apart from the Canadians and French, I submitted a deletion review in November '''[[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2025 November 21|here]]''' which endorsed the no-consensus closure. I have no problem with that, my purpose was to seek a logical global consistency on the suitability of this intersection - it was suggested that RfC was the best place for that, so here I am, again. 

Of course there are valid sources discussing the ethnic origins of many competitors in many sports from many countries, but that would suggest that it would be of more benefit to expand on the specific subject(s) in an article or a series of articles, and similar evidence did not prevent almost all of the other categories being upmerged, resulting in these two groupings being retained in a completely illogical manner; either this is valid for a categorisation fork across the board, or it isn't, because 20 years of this project have shown that the proliferation and maintenance of categories is not adequately patrolled and policed to have narrow, particular forks without 'siblings' being created and populated for similar matters.

There is no evidence that [[:Category:Canadian sportspeople of Slovak descent]] has specific sourcing for its individual importance, and also nothing to prevent [[:Category:Canadian sportspeople of Czech descent]] being created if half a dozen qualifying biographies were found (by the way, glancing at [[:Category:Canadian people of Czech descent]], about half of the 68 articles there look to be sportspeople, so in that respect it would be perfectly valid), regardless of sourcing. On the French side, there is no evidence that [[:Category:French sportspeople of Portuguese descent]] has specific sourcing for its individual importance, and also nothing to prevent [[:Category:French sportspeople of Spanish descent]] being created if half a dozen qualifying biographies were found (by the way, glancing at [[:Category:French people of Spanish descent]], perhaps 100 of the 336 articles there look to be sportspeople, so in that respect it would be perfectly valid) – because that's not the way categories work in practice and never has been: it is assumed that the source exists in the article if there is already a category present which prompts another to be added.

Finally, the deletion of other groupings has left a silly imbalance for certain intersections: [[:Category:French sportspeople of Turkish descent]] is still present but [[:Category:German sportspeople of Turkish descent]] was upmerged, somewhat farcical for any reader with a passing interest in German/Turkish culture and/or sport in the past 50+ years, and of course that complex relationship is a published topic of relevance (see [[Turks in Germany#Sports]]) but that did not 'save' the particular category at the earlier CfD.  We are not discussing whether the topic exists independently but whether it is relevant for the continued existence of this entire intersection of categorisation. And in that regard, there is no difference between the surviving Canadian / French groupings and the deleted American / Australian / British / Spanish groupings other than one or two people contributing to the CfD. The principle is identical, either those should be restored or these other 'survivors' merged too. 

PS I'm not certain if the RfC type I have selected is the most suitable, please change it if not. [[User:Crowsus|Crowsus]] ([[User talk:Crowsus|talk]]) 09:55, 1 December 2025 (UTC)}}

*No 1: diff [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Max_Verstappen&diff=1320872445&oldid=1320724250 "'''disputed'''"] "Verstappen won his maiden title in {{F1|2021}} after overtaking [[Lewis Hamilton]] on the final lap of the disputed [[2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix|Abu Dhabi Grand Prix]]..." 
*No 2: diff [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Max_Verstappen&diff=1321054286&oldid=1320983421 "'''controversial'''"] "Verstappen won his maiden title in {{F1|2021}} after overtaking [[Lewis Hamilton]] on the final lap of the controversial [[2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix|Abu Dhabi Grand Prix]]..." 
*No 3: No change

(Essentially we are adding the word '''disputed,''' '''controversial''', or leaving as is). Also has been discussed in the talk page section above this.

Hello, I have noticed that most all Wikipedia articles in this list have the "government type" subsection of the introbox be either simply "communist state", "unitary communist state" or "federal communist state", however it seems like these changes have been done mostly without formal consensus. Therefore, in the interest of clarification, I would like to ask which of these two options be used in introboxes going forward:

*'''Option A:''' The governments of these states be identified as "unitary communist state" or "federal communist state"
*'''Option B:''' The governments of these states be identified as "unitary one-party socialist republic" or "federal one-party socialist republic"

See the most recent edits in the article and the most recent talk page discussion with claims of adding "disputed content", when summary style was applied which was then reverted in favour of promotional content that did not summarise, such as a link to hancock's personal website. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Graham_Hancock&oldid=1327936351

then this:

 This wiki page is pretty thin, compared to other large multinationals (Nabisco, eg: [[Nabisco]]), so I'd like to suggest adding additional sections with well-resourced information about the organization's work. Food security is a key focus for the organization, so suggest starting here. Below is a draft section with third-party source. All factual / cut and dry. Thoughts? 

Suggest adding new section food security with suggested language and sources below:


Food Security in Yemen: HSA Group leads several efforts to strengthen food security in their home country of Yemen, where more than 17 million people are estimated to not have enough food to eat. (source: https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/mr-tom-fletcher-under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-briefing-security-council-humanitarian-situation-yemen-15-september-2025). HSA Group plays a leading role in assuring that stocks of food like flour, sugar, wheat, and dairy products remain at adequate levels and are distributed to communities in need. (source: https://www.ifc.org/en/stories/2022/yemeni-company-feeds-millions-despite-relentless-challenges) To support these efforts, the International Financial Corporation (IFC) made an investment that provides and mobilizes up to $75 million in debt financing for HSA operations in the country. (source: https://pressroom.ifc.org/all/pages/PressDetail.aspx?ID=26564, https://www.ifc.org/en/pressroom/2021/ifc-partners-with-hsa-group-to-bolster-food-security-in-yemen) The financing package includes a syndicated loan from FMO, the Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank, of up to $20 million. (source: https://www.ifc.org/en/stories/2022/yemeni-company-feeds-millions-despite-relentless-challenges) HSA Group is a key driver of the stability of Yemen's private sector, which constituted 50 percent of GDP and provided employment for around 69.4 percent of the total employed population, prior to the civil war. (source: https://www.ifc.org/en/stories/2022/yemeni-company-feeds-millions-despite-relentless-challenges). Over the last decade, HSA has partnered with UN agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) and the World Food Programme (WFP) on a variety of initiatives and aid programmes that benefit millions of Yemenis. (source: https://www.proparco.fr/en/article/towards-food-security-yemen-hsa-group-concert-un-dfis-and-international-ngos) Its work with the WFP has included milling flour for distribution across Yemen, manufacturing high-energy date bars for school feeding programmes and distributing emergency food baskets across Yemen. (source: https://www.cgiar.org/news-events/news/towards-advancing-childrens-nutritional-intake-taking-stock-of-evidence-based-effective-school-feeding-programs-in-the-middle-east/) Most recently, HSA Group has been partnering with Tetra Pak on a new initiative in Yemen that will serve as a pilot for introducing fortified milk in school feeding programmes. At HSA Group, we remain committed to working with our partners to address Yemen’s food security challenges. (source: https://www.tetrapak.com/en-us/insights/cases-articles/yemen-school-milk-programme-shows-positive-results) Results of the school milk program include higher child cognition scores, improved children's learning, improved household food security, and enhanced mental health among caregivers and children.

Given that reporting on both the alleged perpetrators and the bystander who intervened has now become consistent at this point, with authorities identifying the former and the latter's family undertaking press interviews, I feel that it is now appropriate that the question be put formally given continued fragmented discussion over this matter. As they are currently restricted under different aspects of BLP ([[WP:BLPCRIME]] and [[WP:BLPNAME]] respectively) I feel multiple options are appropriate.

Should this article include the names of the alleged perpetrators and/or the bystander who intervened?

Should the University of New Brunswick (UNB) be included in this list of oldest universities in continuous operation, with a Note distinguishing between (a) its predecessor institution’s founding, (b) the 1800 provincial charter granting degree-conferring authority, and (c) the earliest documented university-level instruction in the 1820s?

Some editors argue that inclusion is inappropriate because documented university-level teaching begins only in the 1820s. Others argue that, consistent with existing table precedent ('''founding versus charter versus formal university status''', e.g., Harvard, which is included based on founding and charter despite later formal university status), UNB may be included with a clarifying Note reflecting charter authority and documentation limits, without asserting undocumented instruction.

For clarity, multiple draft phrasings of the proposed Note have been discussed above; the RfC concerns whether UNB should be included at all with a clarifying Note of this type, not endorsement of a specific final wording.

Input is sought on how [[WP:V]], [[WP:BURDEN]], and table precedent should be applied.[[User:Tinterest|Tinterest]] ([[User talk:Tinterest|talk]]) 00:00, 14 December 2025 (UTC)}}

Should the article "Israel" use the term "genocide" to describe current military actions in the absence of a final legal ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ)?
Some editors argue that using this term as a factual descriptor violates WP:NPOV (Neutral Point of View) and WP:V (Verifiability), as it represents an ongoing legal debate rather than a settled historical fact. I propose that the term should either be removed or strictly attributed to specific organizations (e.g., "X organization has accused...") rather than being used in Wikipedia's own voice. This request aims to ensure the encyclopedia maintains an objective tone and adheres to policy WP:NOTCENSORED by documenting claims accurately without adopting them as definitive facts.

== General Wladyslaw Sikorski case reopened and investigation is under way '''

{{edit restricted}}
'''Recent Re-investigation (2025)''' On July 2, 2025, the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) officially reopened an investigation into the 1943 death of General Władysław Sikorski. This development followed testimony provided by Peter Urbański, son of Bronisław Urbański, a wartime operative and KOP officer. Official Case number is already available to Australian and Polish Government and Police sections involved.

The investigation, led by Polish Prosecutor Marcin Gołębiewski (IPN), has formally designated Peter Urbański as a key witness. On September 10, 2025, the Polish Consulate in Canberra formally registered the case with the International Crime and Cooperation Authority (ICCCA) and the Australian Attorney-General’s Department to facilitate the collection of evidence and testimony.

This new inquiry explores the role of specialized units within the Polish Underground and British Intelligence, specifically regarding the "White Ghost" (Bronisław Urbański) and the logistical circumstances of the Gibraltar crash. Further documentation and research regarding these claims are maintained by the witness at [http://www.tolivewellistohidewell.com/ www.tolivewellistohidewell.com] [[User:Pjurby|Pjurby]] ([[User talk:Pjurby|talk]]) 06:43, 24 December 2025 (UTC)}}

The RfC closer for [[WP:NEWLLM]] stated that a community consensus on identifying AI-generated text would be necessary in order for that guideline to be properly enforced.

The question for this RfC is thus: should this proposal be accepted as a supplementary essay to [[WP:NEWLLM]] (and future AI-restricting guidelines) to serve as a consensus standard for how to identify AI-generated text?

 Hello, regarding to this article. Should we use the infobox historical era layout instead of this infobox country one? Since Fascist Italy can be a broad concept, it can be referred to as the Kingdom of Italy from 1922 to 1943 (this article) and the [[Italian Social Republic]] from 1943 to 1945, something like a disambiguation. Although the article's main point was about the Kingdom of Italy under Fascism, it was a historical period within the state. Note that our article on [[Vargas era]] previously used the infobox country template, but now they changed it to the infobox historical era one. I think this article should follow suit.

{{rfcquote|text=
Following a CfD for categories relating to British sportspeople in 2023 [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2023 December 28#Britsh sportspeople by descent|'''here''']], followed by those for several other groupings nominated by myself in September 2025 [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2025 September 3#American sportspeople by country of descent|'''here''']], all of which resulted in upmerging apart from the Canadians and French, I submitted a deletion review in November '''[[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2025 November 21|here]]''' which endorsed the no-consensus closure. I have no problem with that, my purpose was to seek a logical global consistency on the suitability of this intersection - it was suggested that RfC was the best place for that, so here I am, again. 

Of course there are valid sources discussing the ethnic origins of many competitors in many sports from many countries, but that would suggest that it would be of more benefit to expand on the specific subject(s) in an article or a series of articles, and similar evidence did not prevent almost all of the other categories being upmerged, resulting in these two groupings being retained in a completely illogical manner; either this is valid for a categorisation fork across the board, or it isn't, because 20 years of this project have shown that the proliferation and maintenance of categories is not adequately patrolled and policed to have narrow, particular forks without 'siblings' being created and populated for similar matters.

There is no evidence that [[:Category:Canadian sportspeople of Slovak descent]] has specific sourcing for its individual importance, and also nothing to prevent [[:Category:Canadian sportspeople of Czech descent]] being created if half a dozen qualifying biographies were found (by the way, glancing at [[:Category:Canadian people of Czech descent]], about half of the 68 articles there look to be sportspeople, so in that respect it would be perfectly valid), regardless of sourcing. On the French side, there is no evidence that [[:Category:French sportspeople of Portuguese descent]] has specific sourcing for its individual importance, and also nothing to prevent [[:Category:French sportspeople of Spanish descent]] being created if half a dozen qualifying biographies were found (by the way, glancing at [[:Category:French people of Spanish descent]], perhaps 100 of the 336 articles there look to be sportspeople, so in that respect it would be perfectly valid) – because that's not the way categories work in practice and never has been: it is assumed that the source exists in the article if there is already a category present which prompts another to be added.

Finally, the deletion of other groupings has left a silly imbalance for certain intersections: [[:Category:French sportspeople of Turkish descent]] is still present but [[:Category:German sportspeople of Turkish descent]] was upmerged, somewhat farcical for any reader with a passing interest in German/Turkish culture and/or sport in the past 50+ years, and of course that complex relationship is a published topic of relevance (see [[Turks in Germany#Sports]]) but that did not 'save' the particular category at the earlier CfD.  We are not discussing whether the topic exists independently but whether it is relevant for the continued existence of this entire intersection of categorisation. And in that regard, there is no difference between the surviving Canadian / French groupings and the deleted American / Australian / British / Spanish groupings other than one or two people contributing to the CfD. The principle is identical, either those should be restored or these other 'survivors' merged too. 

PS I'm not certain if the RfC type I have selected is the most suitable, please change it if not. [[User:Crowsus|Crowsus]] ([[User talk:Crowsus|talk]]) 09:55, 1 December 2025 (UTC)}}
