Another RfC (see above on Talk page) has identified that the dates of 1788 (the death of Bach\'s son), and 1829 (the date of the Mendelssohn Bach revival) are of heightened importance to understanding the Bach Legacy as a whole. Bach\'s two composer sons (died 1784 and 1788, respectively) inherited many of Bach composition manuscripts and influenced their dispostion during their lives. Mendelssohn worked extensively to revive Bach\'s reputation between 1824-1829 with the revived performance of Bach\'s Matthew Passion in Germany in 1829. The dates in the Bach chronology should reflect this in a new and enhanced outline covering first, \'\'\'1750-1788\'\'\', followed by \'\'\'1789-1829\'\'\', followed by \'\'\'1830-1899\'\'\', leaving the rest of the section unchanged at this time. This RfC is to determine SUPPORT or OPPOSE for the enhanced specification of the important dates over and against the use of arbitrary century markers currently used in the Bach Legacy section.

We have long tried to find a common ground in either a split, a merge, a move or even a delete, but there is no way we will achieve consensus without some willingness from your side. The issue is clear: the "Kingdom of Germany" is virtually unknown in English. Try [https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=%22Kingdom+of+Germany%22+-Wikipedia&amp;es_th=1 a google search] and you will find no such thing as the article describes. In all fairness, it\'s a rough (mis)translation of a specific German term (Deutsches Reich) with heavy implications. What takes the cake here is that even long after this period of time the English still referred to the entire Mid-Germanic region as \'\'Dutch\'\'. I simply can\'t comprehend why this article name would suit it. The only real obstable to a consensus so far is that we can not decide on \'\'what\'\' to move/rename it to. I\'m asking you (and others) to reach out here, since plenty of people on the talk page have long voiced their disagreement with the current status of the article.

It answers one of the famous [[Five Ws]] of journalism;  \'\'\'Where?\'\'\'  And in the case of a school, unless we are referring to a [[virtual school]], it is common information almost every school will have.  Its absence even defines the virtual school, clarifying the definition.  In [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Infoboxes#Benefits of infoboxes|Inbox terms]], it is a universal \'\'\'key fact\'\'\' about a school.  An opponent brought up that the information is commonly available on the school\'s website.  1) not all schools have websites  2) if it is on their website, it is not always in an easy to find location 3) it is not wikipedia\'s mission as the worldwide virtual encyclopedia to send users away to and external link to find out basic facts about any subject.  It is our mission to "edit" the mass of information about any subject into a manageable size.  [[WP:NOTDIRECTORY]] was mentioned as an argument, but while "phone numbers, fax numbers and e-mail addresses" are specified, a physical address IS NOT.  Throughout wikipedia, physical addresses are used to identify all manner of business locations.  The physical address frequently feeds wikidata and the geographic location parameters.  I cannot understand why we would not want to put this basic information into an article.  I think the deliberate move to not display the physical address, in effect to hide that common information is equivalent to censorship, and [[WP:CENSOR|Wikipedia is not censored]].

We have thousands of school articles that list the physical address.  The datafield is an active and often used parameter in [[Template:Infobox school]] and others.  I noted its absence in [[Template:Infobox university]] at [[Template talk:Infobox university#Address|this discussion]] and was shocked to see the opposition.  One of commenters suggested the parameter be removed from [[Template:Infobox UK school]].  We need a broader based decision.  My first concern is if we have that broader discussion here that it will be closed in the negative based on a very small number of actual commenters.  That is how wikipedia has made some (in my opinion) bad decisions in the past.  My second concern is the historical inability for \'\'ANY\'\' consensus to occur in major decisions at WikiProject Schools.  One of the commenters expected this to be a snowball close in their favor.  I guess this discussion is walking into an unknown minefield of active editors who do not like this information to be public.  So to the closer in advance, I suggest you seriously have that really broad based snowball before deciding to delete the parameter everywhere.</div></td>\n  <td colspan="2" class="diff-empty diff-side-added"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class="diff-marker" data-marker="−"></td>\n  <td class="diff-deletedline diff-side-deleted"><br /></td>\n  <td colspan="2" class="diff-empty diff-side-added"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class="diff-marker" data-marker="−"></td>\n  <td class="diff-deletedline diff-side-deleted"><div>::As I started, this is a commonly used parameter.
