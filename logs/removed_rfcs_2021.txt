Currently, this article vastly comprises considerable lists of attractions, current and former. I'd like to determine opinions on whether this content should remain, be truncated or removed in near entirety. It's worth noting that the "pier" is predominantly an entertainment/amusement venue, rather than a traditional "out to sea" pier.

I have a serious question for this terminology's use, not just in this article, but also in any articles where it has been used to describe someone that was found guilty of crimes while the political leader of their country. When someone is facing impeachment, why must we say they were "impeached"? That term is for someone removed from their political office, I believe, not for someone who is facing impeachment. Should this terminology be reserved for those who were removed from office, not facing impeachment?

* '''YES''' - Political figures who were not removed from their office need this term replaced with something suitable and correct.
* '''NO''' - This term is suitable and fine, even if the political figure was not removed from their office.

[[Sequences]] are a more natural object with which to define the term "basis" than sets, and I'd like to edit the article accordingly. 
 
Since sequences are ordered collections, it would obviate the need for phrases like "ordered basis", which frequently appear in the article. Using sequence notation also makes things much simpler notation-wise, and better lends itself to inductive arguments and other constructions on paper. For example, if you have two bases as sequences (a1,a2,a3) and (b1,b2,b3) of two orthogonal subspaces of R^6, then (a1,a2,a3,b1,b2,b3) is a basis for R^6, and the order is unambiguous despite not being implied by the subscripts alone. As another example, in concatenating (a1,a2,a3) and (a1), the obtained sequence (a1,a2,a3,a1) is not a basis and we can simply say "the sequence is not a basis". However, the union of the sets {a1,a2,a3}, {a1} would be a basis, and we'd have to say something like awkward like "the elements of {a1,a2,a3} and {a1} are not a linearly independent collection of vectors". Is there anything to be gained by calling them sets? The two books I have on linear algebra, Linear Algebra Done Right by Axler, and Linear Algebra by Shilov, use sequences or sequence-like notation. I'm having a similar conversation on the [[Change of basis]] talk page, but I see that they're called sets in this article too.

Regarding the recent edit changing the reason for Ossoff being senior to Warnock from alphabetical by last name to full term/unexpired term citing the House Rules Committee's website as the source, I could find nothing on either the House Rules Committee's website or Senate Rules Committee's website to support that. On top of that, even though something has been found on a US House website in support of that claim, that is not how the American system of government works because that is not how the British system of government works. In the British system of government, on which the American system of government is modeled, the rules of each chamber of the legislature are binding only on that chamber. Therefore even though the cited source for full term/unexpired term rather than alphabetical by last name is "labeled" CRS (Congressional Research Service), it CANNOT be used for articles relating to the US Senate and the edit that stated thusly MUST be changed back under [[Wikipedia:V]], [[Wikipedia:NPOV]], and [[Wikipedia:NOR]] --[[User:Bigpoliticsfan|Bigpoliticsfan]] ([[User talk:Bigpoliticsfan|talk]]) 20:26, 16 January 2021 (UTC)}}

This RFC is about restructuring this page so it talks about the term. {{u|Levivich}} suggested this approach over at [[Talk:Timeline_of_the_Middle_Ages#Requested_move_16_December_2020]]. Instead of the periodization system, we could use something like [[Timeline of the first millennium]] or [[History of the first millennium]] and [[Timeline of the second millennium]] or [[History of the second millennium]]. We could also add CE to the titles for clarification. I would like to get ideas on how we should structure this page and the related pages.

My edit to Conservative Party (UK) has been reverted by [[user:Czello|Czello]] on the basis there is 'no consensus', as have several previous attempts to make such a change. The edit in question is changing the description of party's position on the political spectrum from 'centre-right' to 'centre-right to right-wing' to include the broad range of factions in the party. Please refer to the discussions and arguments on this talk page for context. 

Additionally, from looking at similar pages which have been the subject of similar disputes, such as [[Conservative Party of Canada]], it can be seen that there is precedent for such an approach.

This debate has dragged out over several years on the [[talk:Conservative Party (UK)|talk page]] and I’ve noticed have noticed Czello has recently engaged in edit warring over this, so I thought it best to seek RfC as soon as possible. 

It should be noted that there is by no means unanimous agreement for / against this change, but from looking at the [[talk:Conservative Party (UK)|talk]] page, there are more contributors favouring such a change. Moreover, [[user:BDD|BDD]] (incumbent on the arbitration committee) has stated “I think it's reasonable to say there's consensus on the talk page for such a change”, although this a non-binding judgement. 

Any help would be appreciated ASAP.

It seems like the major focus of this [[WP:EDITWAR]] is where to put the notes marking historical firsts. Since this article covers multiple ethnicities rather than another more singular characteristic (like African-American or sexual orientation), some have the view that putting in the Notes column is cumbersome and prefer to put them in a reference. I disagree, I think having them readily visible in the table itself is preferable. So the question is this: '''Table''' or '''Reference'''?

Following on from a proposed page move at [[Talk:Olympic Stadium (Amsterdam)#Requested move 10 December 2020]], I am seeking to include a specific naming convention for articles on sports stadia. Apart from [[WP:CHURCH]], which is an essay rather than a formal policy, there aren't any specific naming conventions for buildings and structures and I had understood that [[WP:NCPLACE]] applied to sports stadia in that: {{tq|Generic parenthetical disambiguating tags as used for most Wikipedia articles are used only occasionally for geographic names}}. As buildings and structures are located in named places rather than instances of the named place, I believe that this convention should also apply to sports stadia whereby the primary disambiguator should be the city or town they are located unless there is a more suitable disambiguator, for example [[Wembley Stadium]] and [[Wembley Stadium (1923)]]. I would like to know other editors opinions on avoiding the use of parenthetical disambiguating tags for sports stadia as well as the most appropriate project page for including a new naming convention for sports stadia as I am unsure whether [[WP:NCPLACE]] is the correct place to include a new naming convention for sports stadia as a result of the requested move discussion above.

Now, we need to agree how we call different type of amalhamated hromadas, which in Ukrainian are міська громада, селищна громада, and сільська громада. One option would be to call them city hromada, settlement hroada, and village hromada. The drawbacks are that this is not English, and in some cases might be misleading (for example, a rural settlement which is not a village can be the seat of a village hromada). Another option, which I so far was using, is to use urban hromada and rural hrtomada. This is much better English, but this classification does not discriminate between міська громада and селищна громада. My preference is the second one, but we need to discuss the terms before I add so many of them that correction would become impractical. So far I already have added them in several hundred articles.--[[User:Ymblanter|Ymblanter]] ([[User talk:Ymblanter|talk]]) 21:36, 28 December 2020 (UTC)}}

Should we keep the team listings here?  They haven't been seriously updated for a few years now.  It looks like nobody really want to take care of it either.  Unlike most leagues, it is extremely difficult to get something relatively accurate here since teams come and go pretty quickly.  Teams are regularly announced then immediately disappear.  Aside from that, if we choose to keep it, how should team listings to be done?  Should we keep some standards or just use the random mess the ABA site has?

Personally, I would suggest removing the listing and suggest checking the ABA site if someone is actually interested.  [[User:LionMans Account|LionMans Account]] ([[User talk:LionMans Account|talk]]) 01:49, 27 January 2021 (UTC)}}

Request for comments to change the plot synopsis/premise to the official one used by Warner Bros. and Legendary Entertainment for Godzilla vs. Kong. 

Official synopsis:

"Legends collide in “Godzilla vs. Kong” as these mythic adversaries meet in a spectacular battle for the ages, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. Kong and his protectors undertake a perilous journey to find his true home, and with them is Jia, a young orphaned girl with whom he has formed a unique and powerful bond. But they unexpectedly find themselves in the path of an enraged Godzilla, cutting a swath of destruction across the globe. The epic clash between the two titans—instigated by unseen forces—is only the beginning of the mystery that lies deep within the core of the Earth." [https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/godzilla-vs-kong#about] [https://www.godzillavskong.net/?synopsis]

Outdated synopsis no longer used by Warner Bros. or Legendary:

In a time when monsters walk the Earth, humanity's fight for its future sets Godzilla and Kong on a collision course that will see the two most powerful forces of nature on the planet collide in a spectacular battle for the ages. As Monarch embarks on a perilous mission into uncharted terrain and unearths clues to the Titans' origins, a human conspiracy threatens to wipe the creatures, both good and bad, from the face of the earth forever.

I propose adding that the [[2020 bombardment of Stepanakert]] occurred first to both the header and background. Currently, the Stepanakert bombardment is not directly mentioned at all, and is only alluded to in one line ("...claimed that military facilities permanently located there had been targeting civilians in Stepanakert") which makes it appear as if the bombardment of Stepanakert had not actually happened. In the above discussion, I provided numerous sources (including third party ones) of Artsakh politicians confirming that the Ganja missile attacks were the result of this.

Here we go again.

The Gadget and Gadget Definition namespaces are unused, have never been used, and have confusing documentation at [[Wikipedia:Gadget]] due to having never been used. Apparently, all relevant gadgets are in MediaWiki-space (for example, [[MediaWiki:Gadget-Twinkle.js]]). Considering this, there is no reason to keep the namespaces around. 

Somewhat relevant: 
* [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/gadgets-2.0/ Phab tasks for Gadgets-2.0, which would supposedly use this namespace]
* [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)/Archive_139#New_"Gadget:"_and_"Gadget_definition:"_namespaces?|Previous post at the technical village pump about Gadgetspace]]

{{rfcquote|text=
I would like assistance to know why this new scholarly peer reviewed source https://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1350&context=honors is not being accepted now? I would also like assistance on how my addition of Mass Killings Under Communist Regimes is not being allowed if the European colonization with 1 source has been allowed?

:Sources like the ''Reason'' and op-eds in online newspapers are not reliable sources in the least. The issue of "[[Mass killings under communist regimes]]" is highly controversial anyway with disputes on that talk page going on as I type this, so it is not necessary to shoehorn such a controversial and contested topic into this article using such rubbish sources. It seems your edits on the aforementioned article [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes&type=revision&diff=1004950265&oldid=1004939880 have been reverted anyway], and for similar reasons, so now you are bringing the same source and others here. Rummel is hardly a reliable source on deaths under communism, especially his estimates on the USSR which are not taken seriously by any historian on the subject. It is certainly ''not'' an "extremely reputable source everyone uses." And just because you have issues with another part of the article on European colonization doesn't justify your edits which have been rightly reverted on the Mass killings under communist regimes article.--[[User:C.J.

There has been an ongoing debate between editors since October 2020, and probably even before then. The debate is about if [[Ariana Grande]] should be listed as a songwriter. Generally, editors who support this idea cite that she has written almost all of her songs since her debut album [[Yours Truly (Ariana Grande album)|''Yours Truly'']] (2013),  while editors who oppose this idea cite that no sources have been given establishing/proving Grande's notability as a songwriter. I have decided to start an RfC as consensus isn’t forming yet.

This is a two part [[WP:RFC|RfC]].

#Would it be helpful to internally link the pluralisation within the first sentence to the 'Etymology and pluralisation' header?
#*Example: "The '''octopus''' ([[Octopus#Etymology_and_pluralisation|plural '''octopuses''']]) is a soft-bodied..."
#*Reasoning: The correct pluralisation of 'octopus' is a fairly controversial topic, and linking the very first occurrence of it in the article to the section explaining pluralisation could help clear up any confusion. 
#Is [[Merriam-Webster]] a valid source on this topic, as I'm seeing the [[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford dictionary]] being the primary dictionary source throughout this article instead?
#*Specifically, the article "[https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/the-many-plurals-of-octopus-octopi-octopuses-octopodes The Many Plurals of 'Octopus']" has some very good information that should be included and cited.

The consensus on Wikipedia for two-round election has traditionally been to only include the two candidates who made it to the second round. However, recent articles, such as [[2017 French presidential election]] and [[2020-21 United States Senate special election in Georgia]], display both the first and second round results in their infoboxes, and sometimes include candidates who did not make it to the second round. I believe this means a new consensus (not necessarily a change in policy) should be reached on the topic (especially given the high profile of the Georgia special senate election, which so far has not been altered to fit the old consensus).

My question is:

:Should election infoboxes for two-round elections:
:# show only the two candidates who advanced to the second round, and only the number of votes recieved in the second round?
:# show only the two candidates who advanced to the second round, and the numbers of votes recieved in both rounds?
:# or show the two candidates who advanced to the second round and any other canddiates who received 5% or more in the first round, and the numbers of votes recieved in both rounds?

Option 2: "The Baháʼí Faith is a relatively new world religion that originated in the 19th century and has around 5 million adherents. It grew initially in Iran out of Islamic influences but established its own laws and teachings that made a clear break from Islam."

Or an alternative. Both options have at least some support in reliable sources.

Since Saturday, January 30, 2021 (at 20:00:11 UTC to be exact) the creator of YouTube channel this article concerns, Thorn, announced publicly via YouTube and Twitter their [[transgender]] status, revealing their current first name, Abigail. Since this, it has become into editing dispute whether or not to include their former name, Oliver, which previously was throughout the article. EDIT: This name is different from the subject's birth name (Oliver Lennard), and the subject was not notable under their birth name, but was notable under the name "Oliver Thorn".

So the question at hand: '''Should Thorn's previous "dead" name "Oliver Thorn" be listed in the article?'''

*'''A''' — Yes, Thorn's previous name should be '''included''' (in limited fashion allowed by guidelines).
*'''B''' — No, Thorn's previous name should be '''omitted entirely'''.
*'''C''' — Omit in the lead, include in early life. (proposed by {{u|Ceoil}}) (added 08:02, 31 January 2021 (UTC)}}

*'''Question 1''' — should we describe the docuseries as "fictional" in Wikivoice, and should we cite http://www.reneverdugo.org as a source on this page?

Link: [https://www.rfa.org/english/]

Radio Free Asia (RFA) is a US government funded news source. They almost only publish news critical of enemies of the United States.  The articles regularly do not cite their sources, which makes their reporting unreliable. For example, this report (https://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/beatings-01222021193838.html) refers to "RFA’s source" and "Tibetan sources say." I think that RFA should be depreciated in line with a number of other state media sources.

Edit: Here is another example of an article that I would not consider entirely reliable: https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/cosleeping-10312019160528.html . Again it contains no named sources and it ended up being picked up by other media https://www.news.com.au/world/asia/this-is-mass-rape-china-slammed-over-program-that-appoints-men-to-sleep-with-uighur-women/news-story/ed45cd065e39690354b6402d02904557 . Just because it does not contain any named sources does not mean that it is fabricated, but I feel like, at least on a case by case basis, it might make sense to depreciate some articles from RFA that seem like they can't be authenticated. I don't know if there is any precedent for this.

{{rfcquote|text=
STEM articles are extremely underrepresented in [[WP:FA]], and of the few that do exist, many are about products or services, biographical, or otherwise of a non-technical nature. I propose a review of top/high-importance articles in STEM to determine exactly what must be done in order for them to meet the featured article criteria, make appropriate edits, and award them featured article status as soon as possible, without delay. Particularly, material that is fundamental and important to scientific literacy in general or across multiple disciplines. I believe there must be a coordinated effort. Many scientific articles seem to become overly long and disjointed, with so many editors working independently. As a starting point, I think these three articles are all vital to basic scientific literacy and deserve very serious attention: [[Mean]], [[Function (mathematics)]], [[Set (mathematics)]]. My time is limited and I cannot improve them alone, but I would like to be part of such an effort. If at least a couple editors are interested, I'd like to set up an agenda, perhaps with a regular meeting. Once an article is agreed upon, we can read it, report back with comments, discuss how it can be raised to featured article status, and decide on specific edits.

I opened a talk section about the Obama portrait but saw no discussion, so I'm opening an RfC.

All of the portraits listed on this page seem to follow the portraits listed on the official White House presidents list, which is most often the second-term portrait of Presidents who have served a second term (here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/)

Obama's portrait is an exception, his first-term portrait from 2009 is used in the article despite a second-term portrait existing and being used on the White House site and despite all of the presidents around him using their more recent portraits.

'''Question''': Which of these photos should be used for Barack Obama's portrait on this article?

* '''Option A''': First term portrait (current).
* '''Option B''': Second term portrait.
* '''Option C''': Cropped version of second term portrait. 

<gallery mode=packed heights=200px>
File:Official portrait of Barack Obama.jpg|Option A
File:President Barack Obama.jpg|Option B 
File: President Barack Obama (cropped) 4.jpg|Option C 
</gallery>

Personally I think Option C is suitable. [[User:Basil the Bat Lord|Basil the Bat Lord]] ([[User talk:Basil the Bat Lord|talk]]) 06:55, 10 February 2021 (UTC)}}

I want to request comments from editors about changing positions of the countries on the infobox. In particular, changing sides from left to right and vice versa. In all the previous articles concerning the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]], [[Armenia]] and [[Artsakh]] (Nagorno-Karabakh) were shown on the left side of the infobox and [[Azerbaijan]] on the right side. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2020_Armenian–Azerbaijani_clashes], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Armenian–Azerbaijani_clashes], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Armenian–Azerbaijani_border_clashes], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Mardakert_clashes], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Nagorno-Karabakh_clashes], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Mardakert_clashes], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nagorno-Karabakh_War]. It comes from the fact that on the main map of military operations Armenia and Artsakh are on the left side and Azerbaijan on the right side respectively. 

I think it would be more correct if we switch the countries' position for [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war|this]] article as well: Armenia and Artsakh on the left side of the infobox, and Azerbaijan on the right. 

I would be glad to see other editors' opinions.

The current article is centred on the Western gesture called "Eskimo kiss" which is based on the "Kunik" gesture from Inuit culture. I am trying to solicit opinions from editors about how to change the article subject. Here are some suggestions -
* '''Option 1 - Change to Nose rub''' - Change to a general article about nose rub. Explain the various types of nose rubs in different cultures
* '''Option 2 - Centre on Eskimo kiss''' - Centre the article on the Western gesture called "Eskimo kiss" (explain anything else in context)
* '''Option 3 - Centre on Kunik''' - Centre the article on the Inuit gesture "Kunik" (explain anything else in context)
* '''Option 4 - Split Kunik into a new article''' - As Kunik may not the same as Eskimo kiss

{{rfcquote|text=
The three questions below relate to the first paragraph of the lead, and how/if to present the "bantustan" analogy described regarding the proposed enclaves and racially segregated areas in apartheid South Africa. For those new to the discussion, please feel free to review the prior move discussion, which resulted in an article title change from "Palestinian bantustans" to "Palestinian enclaves."

<u>'''Question 1:'''</u> Should the lead make mention of the bantustans analogy?

<u>'''Question 2:'''</u> If yes to Q1, which one of the following three versions should be used to describe the analogy? (These are drawn from the prior three versions of the sentence present in the article. Please feel free to suggest slightly modified wording, but it would be helpful to indicate which is your closest preference based on the versions below.)

*'''A''' Critics of the enclave proposals have analogized them to the bantustans of apartheid South Africa, which were areas set aside for black inhabitants.
*'''B''' By way of the popular comparison between Israel and apartheid-era South Africa, the enclaves are also referred to as the '''West Bank bantustans'''.
*'''C''' The enclave models are, typically by critics, often referred to as bantustans, a term implying a comparison in this regard between Israel and apartheid-era South Africa, and figuratively as a Palestine Archipelago among other terms.

<u>'''Question 3:'''</u> Should "bantustans" be bolded as an alternative title?

The argument is whether or not flags in these tables are merely decorative or actually serve a purpose.

Example: <nowiki>{{flag|USA}}</nowiki> -> {{flag|USA}}

Flags were initially included when the tables were first added to this page (Added Diffs: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Postcrossing&diff=next&oldid=548743316#Users_distribution Users Distribution] & [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Postcrossing&diff=prev&oldid=548743316#History History]) back in April of 2013 by [[User:Starpromi|Starpromi]]. Then, recently, in January of 2021, [[User:MB|MB]] removed all of the flags (Removed Diffs: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Postcrossing&diff=next&oldid=1001497740#Users_distribution Users Distribution] & [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Postcrossing&diff=next&oldid=1001498318#History History]) from the tables citing: {{code|rmv flag icons per [Manual of Style], purely decorational}}

I liked the flags in the tables but am torn between whether or not they were functional. I welcome you to review the [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Icons|Manual of Style/Icons page]] for yourself. More specifically, please review the [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Icons#Flags|Flags]] and [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Icons#Encyclopedic_purpose|Inappropriate use/Encyclopedic purpose]] sections before responding. - [[User:Dynamiccookies|<span style="color: maroon; text-shadow: 2px 2px 1px pink;">'''Dynamiccookies'''</span>]] <small>([[User talk:Dynamiccookies|talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/Dynamiccookies|contribs]])</small> 20:20, 17 February 2021 (UTC)}}

{{Ping|Mr anonymous username|ianmacm|Marc Raphael Felix|John Maynard Friedman}} I also think that a comparison to the SARS-COV-2 virus outbreak is valuable and it will be appreciated by our readers. So I propose to add the following sentence to [[Spanish flu#Comparison with other pandemics|Comparison with other pandemics]] section. The numbers will be updated automatically, as it does in Covid article :
::''The [[COVID-19 pandemic]], as of {{Cases in the COVID-19 pandemic|date|editlink=|ref=no}}, has left more than [[COVID-19 pandemic cases|{{Cases in the COVID-19 pandemic|conround|editlink=|ref=no}} cases]], with [[COVID-19 pandemic deaths|more than {{Cases in the COVID-19 pandemic|dround|editlink=|ref=no}} deaths]].''
We could use [https://covid19.who.int/ WHO's COVID website] as a source for the citation.

I'm thinking that this could be viewed as a subset of the fourth criteria, if not both, at least. The phrasing for it as a criteria could be like this: 

* ''A book or short work is presumed notable if it has been reprinted by an academic or scholarly publisher known for its exclusivity and/or is affiliated with a reputable and notable educational institution, and which is not the original publisher of the work in question. The work must be reprinted in its entirety in book or journal format; newsletters or magazine do not qualify under this guideline.'' 

Adding it to the fourth criteria: 

* ''The book is, or has been, the subject of instruction at two or more schools, colleges, universities or post-graduate programs in any particular country. This includes the book or work being republished by academic or scholarly publishers known for their exclusivity and/or is affiliated with a reputable and notable educational institution, and which is not the original publisher of the work in question.'' 

Any other additions to make it more exclusive could be added in the notes section. Examples of notes could include: 

* ''Reprints of works through self-publishing companies, predatory journals or publishers, or mainstream and indie publishers do not satisfy the requirements for an academic or scholarly press. Reprints of journal articles or academic or scholarly papers do not qualify under this criteria.''

I also added that the publication must be attached to a well-known and notable university, as I figure this will help weed out anyone trying to skirt around this by launching "University of Billy Bob Press".

{{rfcquote|text=
Hi everyone, hope you all are doing well. [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Cricket#Naming_conventions|Following this discussion]], I am of the opinion (in fact many) that we should move away from using birthyear as a disambiguator on cricket articles as they aren't helpful to readers. Just to clear up things, for example, if there are two websites named ImagesHub (one was founded in 2001 and is based in the United Kingdom, other was founded in 2009 and is based in India) then which naming convention is helpful to the reader: ( ImagesHub (website, founded 2001), ImagesHub (website, founded 2009) ) or ( ImagesHub (British website), ImagesHub (Indian website) ) clearly the latter one per [[WP:NCPDAB]].

Team/club (if this is the only team/club they played for), role (such as wicket-keeper), <s>or birthplace</s> are some ways to disambiguate cricket biographies (we should also decide here which ones are helpful other than birth year). We can take help from [[Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(sportspeople)#Association_football_(soccer)]] and after discussion may add cricket conventions there too. 

You may vote support if you agree that we should stop using the birth year as a default disambiguator (only use when it is impossible to disambiguate otherwise. WP has moved away from this but cricket articles are lingering on) or oppose if you have any specific reason so we can build a clear consensus. Thanks.

Lets formalize the discussion happening in the section above a bit. Per The Rambling Man's research, in 2008 as part of an overhaul of the FL criteria, Tony1 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_list_criteria&diff=prev&oldid=212572528&diffmode=source added a line] that is still in those criteria: "it has a minimal proportion of red links", now worded as "a minimal proportion of items are redlinked". This line is under "Visual style", meaning it is a matter of aesthetics, not just [[WP:REDLINK]]. Aesthetics have always been a part of the FL criteria, and as per the above discussion redlinks vs. blacktext can reflect the notability of the items in the list or of the list itself, at least in the mind of the reader.

In the 13 years since then, we've [[WP:FLS|grown]] from 687 to 3759 FLs, and opinions have started to diverge on this requirement. This RfC is to determine if, as a project, we want to keep, remove, or reword this requirement. Please note that, like all RfCs, this is not a vote but a discussion, and it will be closed by the FL director/delegates when we reach a consensus. I've provided some section headers to organize thoughts, but please elaborate on your opinion and not just !vote. --'''[[User:PresN|<span style="color:green">Pres</span>]][[User talk:PresN|<span style="color:blue">N</span>]]''' 15:08, 1 March 2021 (UTC)}}

There seems to be an intractable debate here about who is "Middle Eastern":

* One idea is that it should only include people who were born in and lived in the Middle East.  (e.g. [[Zinedine Zidane]] is a French Football player of Algerian descent; he's not an Algerian Football Player.)
* Another idea is that anyone of any "Middle Eastern ethnicities" should also be counted, but total disagreement and no consistent standards about who qualifies.  

Outside, non-biased, thoughts would be much appreciated.

'''IMP: This RfC has been modified subsequent to initial posting; all editors who commented are requested to re-read the RfC for clarity.'''

Having recently been involved in such an Arbcom case and incident, where one active Arbcom member voting in a case defended his right to discuss active ongoing cases and the participants in those cases on public forums outside Wikipedia, I am requesting the community for their views:

:::'''Should voting (non-recused) Arbcom members be restricted from discussing active cases and participants in such cases in public, non-WMF affiliated locations while the case is ongoing?'''

As repeated above, the scope of this request is very limited to the period that the case is active on the Arbcom page. And scope outside Wikipedia is only non-WMF affiliated locations, and '''not''' private communication between Arbs or private communication between Arbs and participants/stakeholders relevant to any particular case or Arbs/Functionaries/Clerks IRCs, as broad examples.

On advice from one of the arbitrators, it is clarified that this is intended to be a petition for amending the Arbitration Policy, under [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Policy#Ratification and amendment]]. Thanks, [[User:Lourdes|Lourdes]] 07:40, 2 April 2021 (UTC)}}

You can see the diff [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cynthia_Lummis&type=revision&diff=1011493348&oldid=1011490211 here]; the question is, should the lede include the following content at the end:

Given that the usage of the word ''impact'' is figurative in all instances in the article and is prefaced or otherwise surrounded by language that conveys "significance", should the instances of the word be reworded?
* '''Option A''': Yes, the word ''impact'' means "a significant/marked influence" or "to influence significantly" and/or is jargon, so having the words ''significantly'', etc. is redundant. Reword the instances of ''impact'' to be ''effect''/''influence'' and/or ''affect''/''influence'' so that words like "significantly" are no longer redundant.
* '''Option B''': Yes, the language conveying "significance" should be removed since that is implied in using the words ''impact''.
* '''Option C''': No, there is no problem with the way things are currently worded.

{{rfcquote|text=
Kindly requesting input from an outside editor who may weigh in on the discussion above about the propriety of using the word "remain" in the main article's body when referring to the region's formal assignation or inclusion within the borders of a newly-created republic over what I contend is a far more neutral formulation ("included"). 

In its bare essence, I argue that there is no doubt that Karabakh did not belong to either Armenia or Azerbaijan in the immediate aftermath of the dissolution of the Russian Empire (1918). Armenia (and the local Karabakh Armenians) fought over the territory with Azerbaijan (just like they fought over nearby regions Zangezur and Nakhichevan) and its status was hardly settled when the Soviets established control over both republics in 1920. Neither had firm, legally recognized borders until the imposition of the Soviet settlement (these were supposed to be fixed at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, but the Allied Powers never got around to it). In fact, local Armenians chafed at the imposition of an Azerbaijani regime that never established firm roots in the region (even launching an unsuccessful rebellion to topple it) and which is why I argue the word "remain" is highly misleading and inappropriate in this context. I contend my suggestion is far more neutral and faithful to the facts, i.e., saying "inclusion" since from 1918-1921 the region did not have any international legal recognition as belonging to one country or another and that its status was only formalized by the central Soviet administration.

I propose that the following guideline:

be changed to:
:{{tq|For future elections of uncertain date, use a form similar to '''Nth''' Irish general election. }}
mainly to prevent incoming links from being completely useless.
The current format uses the same page title for many elections, completely removing the ability to properly link to a page. All links on and off wiki to "next X election" pages break every 3-5 years, leaving the reader confused as to why someone was linking to the 2020 election from 2009 (e.g.). Using ordinals will alleviate this issue as the pages will move from the unique "10th election" title to the still unique "2022 election" (e.g.). <b style="border:1px solid #0800aa"> [[User:Nixinova|Nixinova]] </b> <b style="border:1px solid #006eff"> [[User talk:Nixinova|T]] </b> <b style="border:1px solid #00a1ff"> [[Special:Contribs/Nixinova|C]] </b>  05:23, 12 April 2021 (UTC)}}

Can we rename this category and its subcategories en masse to use a term more generic than the term "faculty" may imply?

There is a substantial amount of ambiguity and/or incongruity with the use of the term "faculty", so it should probably be replaced.

There is not much observable evidence to explain what was the true intent of the folks who created this category and its subcategories, so we should reach a new consensus on what the name should be, or a consensus on whether or not to try to enforce some sort of a new standard even. 15:29, 22 March 2021 (UTC)}}

I noticed mixed usage of the two language templates &ndash; [[Template:Lang-cnr]] and [[Template:Lang-sr]] for Montenegro-related articles. The question is, what template should I use in this and other Montenegro-related articles when transcribing someone's or something's name to these two respective languages. The official language in Montenegro is [[Montenegrin language]], while [[Serbian language]] is in official usage with several other languages. For example, the article about Montenegro's President [[Milo Đukanović]] uses the Montenegrin template, while an article on the country's Prime Minister [[Zdravko Krivokapić]] uses the Serbian template. Both of them are state officials, and yet there are obviously different standards. I wonder in this particular situation (and in similar cases) should I use Montenegrin or Serbian template? Thank you. --[[User:Governor Sheng|Governor Sheng]] ([[User talk:Governor Sheng|talk]]) 13:31, 23 April 2021 (UTC)}}

#Include his Kurdish background in the lede sentence ("Turkish businessman of Kurdish ethnicity").

Apologies in advance. I would like some users to look at my discussion above. I wish to make a myriad of stylistic edits to improve the article.
* Eliminate redundancy in phrasing and improve prose.
* Merge duplicate content into a section that covers both and is easy for readers to follow and be consistently maintained (compare [[Zenobia#Titles|Titles]] and [[Zenobia#Empress_and_open_rebellion|Empress..]] to see existing issue) and reduces the length slightly given that it's over 129kB big ([[Wikipedia:Article_size#Readability_issues|WP:AS]], [[WP:CHOKING]], [[WP:TOOBIG]]).
* Separate "Governance" (and its sub-subsections 'Culture' and 'Religion') into its own standalone section. But keep "Administration" in its place in the parent section [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zenobia&diff=1015391744&oldid=1015374836#Administration], as it includes information that is part of the chronology of her Expansion to Downfall whereas the aforementioned subsections are a sidetrack that is better suited as a standalone. See my example before revert: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zenobia&diff=prev&oldid=1015391744#Governance] (Ignore the "Judaism" heading which blended into the paragraph, I intended to fix that).

I think this needs to be reviewed seriously. Verified social media accounts act as either individual or group stances, and as such there's functionally little difference between a verified endorsement tweet and a press release from an organization.

The lede lists a number of different states to which Königsberg belonged - "the Duchy of Prussia, the Kingdom of Prussia, the German Empire, the Weimar Republic, and Nazi Germany. " . From 1758 to 1762 it was formally part of the Russian Empire, the seat of the Russian Governors of East Prussia.  I added this to the lede, but have been reverted twice so I have created this RFC. 
I think this fact is relevant, especially given that the city is now again part of Russia, and omitting it creates a false impression of continuous Prussian occupation.

There has been some debate about how long it takes for a change to become stable. There are 2 questions, please indicate which you're answer is for. Things like [[WP:TITLECHANGES]], [[WP:RETAIN]], [[WP:CFDS]] and [[WP:RMCI]] should be updated if this RFC gains consensus.

(1) How long in general should a version have been in place for it to be considered "stable" for the purpose of obtaining consensus? This isn't intended to be a strict rule but merely give some general rule since sometimes (like with the technical request of [[Talk:Kereta Api Indonesia#Requested move 8 June 2020]]) a move made years ago is requested as a revert of an undiscussed move even though the move happened over 2 years ago and in some cases like [[Omos]] an unrevert was made that the change was made a month ago even though it had had the same target since 2004 prior to the change.

(2) How long should a version take to be stable for the purpose of [[WP:RETAIN]] when a page is edited or renamed against this (and one of the exceptions doesn't apply, such as communality, strong ties or ATDAB)? See examples of [[Humour]] and [[Chinese whispers]] where this has been debated. {{ping|SnowFire|FOARP|Necrothesp|Calidum}} who were involved significantly in the chinese whispers debate on this.

In 2015, the community decided at [[Talk:Battle_of_Chawinda/Archive_1#DID_the_battle_lead_to_Major_Pakistani_victory?|this RfC]] that Pakistan won the Battle of Chawinda.  Pro-Indian editors disputed the RfC outcome on the administrator's noticeboard, and the outcome of this RfC close review was to [[Special:Permalink/644921474#Reviewing RfC closure : Battle of Chawinda|confirm]] the Pakistani victory.  In 2018, a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Chawinda/Archive_2#Result talk page consensus] decided that the battle was "inconclusive".  At issue in this RfC is the question of which of the previous consensuses takes precedence.

'''Note:''' The Battle of Chawinda was the final engagement of the Second Kashmir War.  It is common ground that the Second Kashmir War was inconclusive.  The decision needed here is not about the outcome of the campaign, but the outcome of this particular battle within it.

Procedurally speaking, there is dispute about whether RfC nominators should sign their nomination.

A strong part of rust are the components. we have <code>cargo</code>, <code>clippy</code>, <code>rustfmt</code>, <code>rust-docs</code> and more. I would like to raise the question of if these components should be included in the rust wikipedia page

''' For '''

* Many of these components are included in the rust source tree (not all)
* A valid thing rust has going for it *is* this ecosystem, It is silly to ignore
* I would argue <code>cargo</code> especially is a part of the core of rust - even if not needed.

''' Against '''

* Components are managed by <code>rustup</code>. <code>rustup</code> is developed by rust, but is not "core" (ie a secondary project)
* Technically, the rust lang is just the <code>rustc</code> component - nothing more is needed (ie the lang breaks without it) (although all the components help a lot!)
* Not all components are developed in the core rust source tree

''' Solutions '''

* Separate article for rust components
* Inclusion under the features section
* New category.

{{rfcquote|text=
One of George's most significant posts was [[Head of the Commonwealth]]. [[Head of the Commonwealth]] is not a royal title, but an official post in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], just like [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]. This position is non-hereditary and is therefore not inherited with other royal titles; the Head is appointed by the [[Commonwealth heads of government]]. The lead section of the article also states that "George relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948 and instead adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth." This change in status should be reflected in the infobox. So, if "Emperor of India" is included in the infobox, then "Head of the Commonwealth" should also be included.

The preview of the infobox with Head of the Commonwealth included, can be seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_VI&diff=prev&oldid=1019310575 here].

And to those who say that infobox shouldn't be too long, adding an important title doesn't make it too long, but rather makes it better and more informative. See the infobox at [[Sushma Swaraj]].

No, no, this is a voting rights question." Greenblatt responded in a letter that Carlson’s "attempt to at first dismiss this theory, while in the very next breath endorsing it under cover of 'a voting rights question,' does not give him free license to invoke a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] trope. In fact, it’s worse, because he’s using a [[straw man]] – [[Suffrage|voting rights]] – to give an underhanded endorsement of white supremacist beliefs while ironically suggesting it’s not really white supremacism.” '''Historian of conservative media [[Nicole Hemmer]] wrote, "In the post-Trump era" Carlson "is among the leading voices working deliberately to mainstream a set of virulently racist anti-immigrant ideas."'''[https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/15/opinions/tucker-carlson-replacement-theory-peter-brimelow-republican-party-hemmer/index.html] '''[[Michael Gerson]], a speechwriter for former president [[George W.

{{rfcquote|text=
The album ''[[On Parole]]'' was recorded by the London based rock group [[Motörhead]] as their debut album under contract to [[United Artists]] Records at [[Rockfield Studios]] at the end of 1975. Not seeing commercial potential in the album, UA shelved its release against the wishes of the band and their management. Four years later, after the group had gained popularity in Britain, UA gave the album a belated release.

The wikipedia article of the album, created on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_Parole&oldid=94935685 19:27, 17 December 2006] through to the present day has consistently classified the album as a [[studio album]]. From time to time, some wikipedia editors have sought to reclassify references to the album as being non-studio. This is another such issue of dispute, after [[Talk:Motörhead_discography#Categorisation_of_On_Parole|this one from 13 January 2018]], and has currently come to an impasse between two editors. There appears to be an absence of other editors interested in the subject wanting to contribute to this discussion, so outside neutral opinions would be appreciated.

{{rfcquote|text=
The current CSS rule for the {{code|texhtml}} class in [[MediaWiki:Common.css]] uses [[Times New Roman]] and its clones for displaying math, with no mention of the [[Computer Modern]] font that {{tag|math|o}} uses. This difference is a major source of visual inconsistency between the two math layout options on Wikipedia, and I propose that a different font fallback sequence to be used so that a CM-based font is used first when available.

{{aligned table|class=wikitable|cols=3|row1header=y
|title=Comparison of math layout options
| 1=Current {{tlx|math}}
| 2={{tag|math|o}}
| 3=Proposed {{tlx|math}}<br/><small>(view source for CSS rules)

| 4={{math|123456789}}
| 5=<math>123456789</math>
| 6=<span class=texhtml style="font-family: 'Latin Modern Roman 8', 'CMU Serif', 'Nimbus Roman No9 L', 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">123456789</span>

| 7={{math|1={{!}}''f''(''x'') − ''a''{{!}} < ε}}
| 8=<math display=inline>\left|f(x) -a \right| < \epsilon</math>
| 9=<span class=texhtml style="font-family: 'Latin Modern Roman 8', 'CMU Serif', 'Nimbus Roman No9 L', 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">{{!}}''f''(''x'') − ''a''{{!}} < ε</span>

| 11=<math display=inline>(\lambda x.M)</math>
| 12=<span class=texhtml style="font-family: 'Latin Modern Roman 8', 'CMU Serif', 'Nimbus Roman No9 L', 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">(&lambda;''x''.''M'')</span>
}}
(There's something really odd going on with the CM OpenType fonts not having the greek stuff.)

Now this change does not make it indistinguishable from {{tag|math|o}}. There's still a stark difference in font weight (likely due to antialiasing and other rendering shenanigans), and the Greek letters somehow have to be filled in by the Times fallback. But it's one step closer for readers that have the fonts installed.

{{rfcquote|text=
The age of consent in Romania is 16. It was 15, but it was changed to 16 in 2020. 

The criminal code now reads:[http://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocument/109855]

Articolul 220

Actul sexual cu un minor
(1) Raportul sexual, actul sexual oral sau anal, precum și orice alte acte de penetrare vaginală sau anală comise cu un minor cu vârsta între 14 și 16 ani se pedepsesc cu închisoarea de la unu la 5 ani.

Translation: ''"Sexual intercourse, oral or anal intercourse, as well as any other acts of vaginal or anal penetration committed with a minor aged between 14 and 16 shall be punished by imprisonment from one year to five years."''

Here is the Law no. 217 of 29 October 2020, that was published in [[Monitorul Oficial]] on 30 October 2020, which modified the Criminal Code:[http://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocumentAfis/231967]

An ip is constantly  vandalizing the section, writing that the age of consent is 15. It is not, it used to be, but now it is 16! (the ip is citing outdated sources, and also non legal, non reliable sources).

If this continues, the article may need to be protected.[[Special:Contributions/2A02:2F01:53FF:FFFF:0:0:6465:7829|2A02:2F01:53FF:FFFF:0:0:6465:7829]] ([[User talk:2A02:2F01:53FF:FFFF:0:0:6465:7829|talk]]) 15:34, 29 May 2021 (UTC)}}

From time to time editors remove images identifying Islamic clerics and/or scholars from, or add images to, articles in the field of Islam. An example appears in [[Wikipedia:Files_for_discussion/2021_May_8#File:AkhtarRazaKhan(Image).jpg|this discussion]] which is due to have closed very soon, but the more general principle is important. That discussion was catalysed by this IP editor comment: "''Tajjusharia don't wanted to take photo video it's haram so don't put his photo here''". The word "haram" is significant.

For this RfC there are three questions:
* Question 1: Should Islamic articles (and Drafts) have images of Islamic clerics and/or scholars?
* Question 2: Should images of Islamic clerics and/or scholars be retained or be deleted insofar as this affects Wikipedia, not Commons?
* Question 3: Should the outcome of this RfC be embedded in this segment of the Manual of Style?

It's been over a year since an RfC on this topic, but we've done this rodeo twice before, once in [[Talk:Ilhan_Omar/Archive_7|2019]] and once in [[Talk:Ilhan_Omar/Archive_17#RFC:_Should_Anti-semitism_accusations_be_included_in_the_lede?|2020]], with opposite results. Anti-Semitism in the US has taken on new significance since then, and the section in the article body covering these accusations is quite extensive, so it's time to revisit. Two questions for my esteemed collegues: First, should we '''include''' or '''exclude''' some mention of these accusations in the lead. Second, should do we '''agree''' or '''disagree''' with the following compromise wording suggested by our esteemed collegue Toa Nidhiki05:

{{blockquote|Omar has been accused of antisemitism by both Democrats and Republicans as well as Jewish civil rights groups for comments about Israel which they said perpetuated the antisemitic canards that Jews have dual loyalty, a charge which Omar has denied.}} [[User:Benevolent human|Benevolent human]] ([[User talk:Benevolent human|talk]]) 20:21, 1 June 2021 (UTC)}}

They created a section titled "Political ambition" and then added "Anam's political ambitions surfaced when he supported Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus in efforts to form a political party called Nagorik Shakti (Citizen Power)." again no source. They wrote "One of Anam's most influential articles was "This is no way to strengthen democracy"," and then excerpted large content from the article; might possibly be a copyright violation. There is no source for the claim the article is one of Anam's most influential and I am left to conclude it is the users own opinion. Most of their edits contain personal comments and large excerpts from copyright work that might be pushing the boundaries of fair usage. I reverted their edits and they have reverted mine. Rather than risk an edit war I bring the issue up for further discussion.

The following fields are among those that automatically link to the party entered in [[Template:Infobox election]]:
*| party1 =, | party2 =, etc.
*| before_party =
*| after_party =
A problem arises on what to enter if the politician is independent of any party, or an [[Independent politician|"independent"]]—a lower-case word. One solution has been to enter <nowiki>[[Independent politician|Indpendent]]</nowiki>, which renders as "Independent". The problem with this is that the capitalization renders in the same manner that party affiliation one of the many [[Independent Party|Independent Parties]] would render, creating the impression that the independent politician actually belongs to a party. 

My solution would be to make the following entry: <nowiki>[[Independent politician|(independent)]]</nowiki>, which renders as "(independent)", yet does not seem glaringly different because of the lack of capitalization or appear to be improperly without a leading capital letter.

I invite editors to weigh in on the following choices of entry in the infobox fields, mentioned above:
#<nowiki>[[Independent politician|(independent)]]</nowiki>, which renders as [[Independent politician|(independent)]]
#<nowiki>[[Independent politician|Independent]]</nowiki>, which renders as [[Independent politician|Independent]]
#Some other solution that you suggest.

The following scenario is frustratingly common: An editor changes the longstanding status quo with an edit. You revert the edit and encourage them to discuss on the talk page. They then revert that revert. There should be repercussions for this disregard of civil discussion through the [[Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle|BOLD, revert, discuss cycle]]. I propose that the following becomes policy:

'''If a user's edit that changes the status quo is reverted, a revert of that revert will result in a talk page warning. A second revert of such a revert begets a 24 hour block.'''

This would not apply to an edit originally removing some gross violation of Wikipedia policy, such as a BLP vio. And, [[WP:3RR|3RR]] would still stand, as the 3 reverts do not necessarily have to be over the exact same issue. ~ [[User:HAL333|<span style="background:red; color:white; padding:2px; border:1px solid red;">'''HAL'''</span>]][[User talk:HAL333|<span style="background:black; color:white; padding:2px; border:1px solid red;">'''333'''</span>]] 18:36, 6 June 2021 (UTC)}}

I've attempted to add a short section about documented corruption involving the attribution of the Kongo contract to Vickers and Mitsui.  This addition has been removed twice.  The second time I posted it I added citations and removed an 'apparently offending' link to another Wikipedia article.

Here's my attempted addition:
Siemens-Vickers Scandal
Main article: Siemens scandal
In January 1914, a telegram leaked from Siemens' Tokyo office to Reuters along with further reporting by the New York Times and Asahi Shimbun led to an investigation by Japanese authorities which revealed a pattern of bribery and kickbacks by German and English armaments corporations. Siemens had been paying senior Japanese officials a secret 15% kickback, until Vickers had outbid them by offering 25%. Vickers had paid 210,000 yen to Admiral Fuji of the Imperial Japanese Navy procurement in 1911 and 1912, and 40,000 yen to Vice Admiral Kazu, related to obtaining the contract for building the Kongō. Kazu was court-martialed in May 1914, fined 400,000 yen and sentenced to 3 years in prison. As a result of the Siemens-Vickers Scandal revolving around the contracts of building the Kongo, the government of Prime Minister Yamamoto resigned March 23, 1914. Senior executives of the Mitsui corporation, Japanese partners of Vickers, also resigned [9][10]

How can I improve this contribution?  What are (is) the issue? Should it be placed in a different section, or placed in the article about the 'Kongo Class of battlecruisers'?

* "Omar’s tweet is the latest among her frequent criticisms of the Israeli government that drew ire from lawmakers of both parties who have condemned them as perpetuating antisemitic stereotypes." - Washington Post [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jewish-democrats-omar-israel/2021/06/10/45d5db22-c9e9-11eb-a11b-6c6191ccd599_story.html]
* "Her Twitter comment in 2019 that support in Washington for Israel was “all about the Benjamins baby” kicked off weeks of fighting that ended in a resolution on the House floor condemning bigotry and anti-Semitism. The comments played into anti-Semitic tropes that have roots in the Middle Ages, when Jews were barred from entering most professions and thus became moneylenders — a task that Christians would not take on because of prohibitions against usury." [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/10/us/politics/ilhan-omar-israel.html]

Per [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Index/Palestine-Israel_articles#ARBPIA_General_Sanctions|5.b.1 of ARBPIA]], I am therefore opening a new RFC whether, in light of this new information, some mention of criticism of Omar's alleged stereotyping of American Jews unaffiliated with Israel should be mentioned in the lead.

The policy relevant here is [[WP:NAVCOLOR]] and that would mean that this template and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AWhatLinksHere&target=Template%3ALargest+cities&namespace=10 templates that implement it] would need to be deprecated and deleted.

[[WP:NAVCOLOR]] is applicable here because the design is arbitrary and capricious.  This is due to the fact that this template gives options to list either 10 or 20 city entries and either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 pictures of cities and these options prevent the internal dimensions of the template from staying consistent.

Should the UploadVR be changed from Defunct to Operating?  
Background: The company operated 2 businesses before:  1) A media website at uploadvr.com 2) Workspaces located in LA and SF. The company shut down it's workspaces. Leases were transferred to new entities. The company re-organized under a new name UVR MEDIA, LLC and still operates uploadvr.com. Here is a supporting article [https://disruptglobal.io/the-uploadvr-lawsuit-media-men-list-and-tragic-unintended-impacts-of-metoo-in-media-and-tech/ this article]. It states: ''"Half a year later, UploadVR laid off their LA and SF coworking staff and transitioned the spaces to new operators, The Riveter and Starfish respectively, who continued to house their VR, AR and AI focused tenants. UVR Media LLC was formed and UploadVR continued to expand its existing platform of news and content. Even though the company was ultimately able to recover and reclaim its position in the media space, the whole thing dealt them a huge blow and destroyed much of what they had created to support the early VR and AR community."''

:It is also quiet aparant from the website that is still operating. I am asking that the first sentence be changed so that it says "UploadVR (formerly UploadVR, Inc. and Upload Inc.) is an American virtual reality-focused technology..."
:Also, the Infobox needs to be udpated and Defunct status removed.

* "Omar’s tweet is the latest among her frequent criticisms of the Israeli government that drew ire from lawmakers of both parties who have condemned them as perpetuating antisemitic stereotypes." - Washington Post [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jewish-democrats-omar-israel/2021/06/10/45d5db22-c9e9-11eb-a11b-6c6191ccd599_story.html]
* "Her Twitter comment in 2019 that support in Washington for Israel was “all about the Benjamins baby” kicked off weeks of fighting that ended in a resolution on the House floor condemning bigotry and anti-Semitism. The comments played into anti-Semitic tropes that have roots in the Middle Ages, when Jews were barred from entering most professions and thus became moneylenders — a task that Christians would not take on because of prohibitions against usury." [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/10/us/politics/ilhan-omar-israel.html]

Having addressed procedural concerns about the previous RFC, I am therefore opening a new RFC whether, in light of this new information, some mention of criticism of Omar's alleged stereotyping of American Jews unaffiliated with Israel should be mentioned in the lead.

the relativity infoboxes on [[Riemannian geometry]] should be moved to [[pseudo-Riemannian geometry]]. 

while Riemannian geometry may have inspired pseudo-Riemannian geometry, which this is one way people can understand its impact on science, the latter is not the former.

i don't think it's appropriate to talk about Riemannian geometry in the terms of physics. 

i would like to move any GR/SR infoboxes on Riemannian concepts to the pseudo-equivalent if they exist. if the equivalent does not exist, i would like to remove it.

Euler is described as a physicist in the lead paragraph, but can his predecessors', contemporaries' and own contributions be considered as mathematics when compared to the modern definition of physics?
 
just throwing this out there.

i mean, yes of course he used mathematics to give us some insightful and invaluable explanation for a physical phenomenon.

but i don't think this warrants automatic categorisation under physics since this website has pages explaining and describing the delineation of modern physics from classical physics. 

a good example of modern physics is the [[Lorentz transformation]]. it has been accepted as the cornerstone of physics for a century now.

i note that even when The Greats met the highest burden ([[mathematical proof]]) contributing to our understanding of physical phenomena using mathematics.

physics has not been required to meet this level of proof for some time, at least since the time of maxwell and faraday.

should we remove the description of 'physics' in the lead for The Greats who are known for their contributions to mathematics, since latter entails the former when considering the burden they met?

Editors felt that it should still be possible to access books currently in this namespace. Two options were presented to achieve this: the ability to [[WP:REFUND]] pages on request, and archival by moving pages in the Book namespace to another namespace. There seems to be a rough consensus that the first approach will be satisfactory, although this can be put to further discussion if there is disagreement. If a deletion route is taken then steps should be taken, preceding deletion of the namespace and its pages, to ensure that administrators will be able to provide copies of the deleted page in response to a [[WP:REFUND]] request.

is it fair to include a portrait of sir andrew wiles on the Number Theory page, considering there is a picture of erdos and terry?

i mean, he did prove The Last Theorem, right?

it seems there is a bit of text dedicated to this theorem on the page, right?
: from what i can see, it's mentioned under Early modern number theory, subsections fermat, euler, and 'lagrange, legendre and gauss'.

i know some would say he's not any of the people on this page, the 'lowest' probably being Erdos or terry. i respect all these guys.

but my view is if Erdos gets a spot, so does sir andrew. he did prove it. and he deserves some recognition outside of the fermat's last theorem page.

just my 2c

i disagree that euclid deserves to be in the infobox as an influence for archimedes.

i am not disputing archimedes read his work, best evidenced by his "author of the Elements" quote.

however, i just don't see it. i consider euclid and archimedes to be exact opposites. 

for a long time the influences and influenced portions of his infobox were blank, and recently there have been some introductions.

i call upon the community to argue and discuss the appropriateness of these insertions, given the scarcity of verified information we have on this figure.

if anyone influenced archimedes, i would argue it's [[Thales]] or [[Pythagoras]]. obviously no evidence for that either, nor am i asking for comment on that.
: this is merely an off-the-cuff comment when i assess archimedes' work in the context of the two individuals i've named above. it fits better. but again i am not asking for comment or approval on that.

should we keep the influences and influenced fields for archimedes infobox? [[Special:Contributions/198.53.108.48|198.53.108.48]] ([[User talk:198.53.108.48|talk]]) 19:48, 21 June 2021 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
archimedes is a significant figure in the history of many fields, including mathematics, physics and general science. are the influence{s,d} infobox attributes appropriate for a figure of his stature?

sorry for the new rfc, but this has been bugging me. i would ask readers to consider the fact i spent at least 5 hours investigating and contributing to these additions, and i ended up concluding they're not necessary.

i would like to have a discussion with the larger audience about whether we need the influence{s,d} infobox attributes for archimedes, given how many people he influenced and how his work shaped multiple fields.
: indeed, the lead of the article suggests he could be seen as the forefather of a entire field(s), which suggests the worthy additions to the infobox could far exceed a handful when including popular and important contributors from the 'teen' centuries.

i think it would be better to leave the infobox as it was before, which did not have the influence{s,d} fields. it is known how important he was, and i think making any list of figures just dilutes or potentially erodes from that.

thoughts?

{{rfcquote|text=
There's been a difficultly amongst editors regarding the statement "Sixty-nine states have signed declarations in statements at the UNGA affirming that the Holodomor was as a 'national tragedy of the Ukrainian people'..." The issue is whether it is OK to count the number of countries from the UN General Assembly statements from 4 documents [https://undocs.org/A/C.3/58/9], [https://undocs.org/A/C.3/58/9/Add.1], [https://undocs.org/A/63/613], [https://undocs.org/A/68/655], and [https://undocs.org/A/73/630]. No primary or secondary sources lists the count, however per [[WP:CALC]] routine calculations are allowed.

To be honest, I was the skeptical editor and didn't trust the 69 number for the longest time. It's an utter pain trying to calculate all the unique countries, so I wrote a Python script to do it[https://pastebin.com/cQ4vVzTu]. I'm still not 100% sure if I'm correct. I've never seen a page try to do this, so I'm worried that it's OR.

There are a few options:
*'''A: Keep the text as 69 (or 70), explicitly listing the amount'''
*'''B: Write "at least 69 (or 70)"'''
*'''C: Change it to "many countries" or something similar''' [[User:Stix1776|Stix1776]] ([[User talk:Stix1776|talk]]) 08:09, 30 May 2021 (UTC)}}

The previous [[Talk:Azov Battalion/Archive 1#Far-right%2C%20neo-Nazi%20as%20result%20of%20WP:NPOV%20rule%20ignoration|RfC]] has come to the conclusion the Azov Battalion can't be described as neo-Nazi, but several editors have noted that a new RfC is needed to settle the matter.

1. '''In the first sentence''' (Azov Battalion is a ___________ Ukrainian National Guard regiment), '''which adjective, if any, should be used to describe the political ideology of the military unit?'''

:a. Right-wing/nationalist;
:b. Far-right;
:c. Neo-Nazi;
:d. Do not use any adjective.
:e. neo-fascist

2. '''How should the article handle reports on Azov's links to neo-Nazi groups and descriptions as being such?''' (Note. You may combine answers from A-C with D-E).
:a. Mention that many political observers and news outlets have described it as a neo-Nazi organization;
:b. Mention that many political observers and news outlets have reported extensively on its links to neo-Nazi groups;
:c. Mention that many political observers and news outlets have described it as neo-Nazi and reported extensively on having links to neo-Nazi groups;
:d. State in wikivoice it is linked to neo-Nazis;
:e. State in wikivoice it is neo-Nazi;
:f. Do not include the information in the lead. 
:g. Mention that many political observers and news outlets have described it as a neo-fascist organization. (Using "Nazi" has baggage, since there may be weaker ties to WWII-era Hitlerism than to other modern neo-fascist groups, who may be as inspired by, say, Mussolini as by Hitler).

I think we should remove the ideologies of democratic socialism, eco-socialism, feminism and republicanism from the infobox as these are only supported by the party's website, which is not an [[WP:INDEPENDENT|independent source]]. However, [[U|Vif12vf]] said - ''"Because you largely can't find good third-party sources describing actual ideologies in Norway because ideology is not a subject ever spoken of in specifics, and practically all norwegian media outlets have a specific political standpoint meaning they lack neutrality on the subject."'' Personally, I do not have the knowledge to support or deny this claim. However, either way I don't think we should let claims stand that can't be backed by at least one reliable independent source. Also, even with these ideologies removed there will still be multiple ideologies left listed in the infobox (revolutionary socialism, communism, Marxism and hard Euroscepticism), all of which are supported by at least one independent source. I think this is enough ideologies to go with for the infobox. The infobox is too overloaded with 8 different ideologies, 4 is enough and these are properly cited. The infobox is supposed to be a summary and I've seen multiple editors state we should be limiting the number of ideologies we include the infobox to just a couple.

{{rfcquote|text=
Speedy deletion criterion U3 currently reads as follows:
{{quote|[[Wikipedia:Picture tutorial#Galleries|Galleries]] in the userspace that consist mostly or entirely of [[Wikipedia:Non-free content|"fair use" or non-free images]]. Wikipedia's non-free content policy prohibits the use of non-free content in userspace, even content that the user has uploaded; use of content in the public domain or under a free license is acceptable.}}
This criterion is unnecessary for multiple reasons. First, non-free media is automatically removed from non-articles by {{u|JJMC89 bot}}, usually within a few hours of being added. There is no way to disable this, meaning that it's not possible for a non-free gallery to stick around in userspace for long.
Secondly, these pages would be, if necessary, eligible for criterion under U5: a non-free media gallery is not closely aligned with Wikipedia's goals of being a free encyclopedia.

Following this, the criterion is rarely if ever used. I created a list of [[User:Elli/Last deletions|the 2500 most recent page deletions]] - not a single U3 among them. There is no reason to keep a redundant criterion that doesn't solve any problem that currently exists.

{{rfcquote|text=
The other day I tagged {{tl|Qonja}} for a G8 speedy, as I considered it a "subpage with no parent page" (the header article [[Qonja]] does not exist). {{user|Fastily}} overturned the G8 and upon being asked, responded that they didn't feel it fit G8.

I see no benefit to keeping a page around and letting it spend God knows how long in XFD simply because there isn't a CSD that clearly fits it. This seems like a blatantly obvious template to delete speedily, even if it doesn't quite fit squarely into an existing G8 or other CSD category. If the parent article -- that is, the article the navigational template is named after and/or clearly intended to be used on -- has been deleted or does not exist, that seems like it falls under "subpages dependent on a nonexistant or deleted page", and I don't understand why it's not already cited as an example of something fitting G8.

tl;dr: '''''Should G8 be amended to include "navigational templates where the parent article has been deleted or does not exist"?''''' I say yes for the reasons I just stated.

{{rfcquote|text=
At [[Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates#(Posted) Syrian presidential election]], there is much controversy about whether the ITN blurb about the [[2021 Syrian presidential election]] should reflect, as the article does, that the election was not free or fair according to reliable sources. Currently the blurb reads only "[[Bashar al-Assad]] is '''[[2021 Syrian presidential election|re-elected]]''' as [[president of Syria]]."

I propose that we seek to find consensus for future similar cases by selecting one of two possible options (with suboptions):

*'''Option 1: No qualification.''' E.g.: "X is elected president of Fooland".
*'''Option 2: With a qualification''' (a) in Wikipedia's voice or (b) attributed to sources, or (c) either, depending on the stable wording in the article's lead. E.g.: "X is elected president of Fooland in unfree elections", or "X is elected president of Fooland in, according to international media, unfree elections.".

I would welcome a view on the colour schemes used in various professional wrestling navigational templates. I've added the RfC here but there are many more examples, e.g. as seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:World_Championship_Wrestling_navigational_boxes here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:WWE_championship_navigational_boxes here].

There's an increasing tendency for editors to add idiosyncratic colour schemes, some of them very vividly coloured, to these templates. I have concerned that this may be causing some issues with reference to the below points:

*[[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Professional_wrestling/Archive_109#template_colors|"Ensure that color is not the only method used to convey important information. Especially, do not use colored text or background unless its status is also indicated using another method, such as an accessible symbol matched to a legend, or footnote labels. Otherwise, blind users or readers accessing Wikipedia through a printout or device without a color screen will not receive that information.]]"
*[[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Professional_wrestling/Archive_109#template_colors|"Some readers of Wikipedia are partially or fully color-blind or visually impaired. Ensure the contrast of the text with its background reaches at least Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0's AA level, and AAA level when feasible (see WCAG's "Understanding SC 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum)").]]" 

I would welcome views from the community on whether or not these colour schemes are potentially creating issues.  [[User:McPhail|McPhail]] ([[User talk:McPhail|talk]]) 13:29, 3 June 2021 (UTC)}}

I note that [[Land yacht]] redirects to [[Land sailing]], where all the vehicle shown are sail-powered, and that [[Wind-powered vehicle]] includes rotor-driven vehicles, like ''Blackbird''. Furthermore, Merriam-Webster defines "land yacht" as a "3-wheel wind-driven recreation vehicle consisting usually of a bare-frame structure and a single sail and used especially on areas of firmly packed sand" or "a large motor vehicle", which shows ambiguity of meaning. Furthermore a [[Yacht]] often connotes on-board accommodations. Therefore, by the [[WP:SURPRISE|principle of least astonishment]], I recommend moving this article to [[Blackbird (wind-powered vehicle)]].

just in the off-chance {{ping|SilverMatsu}} and {{ping|Researcherphd}} engage in a dispute over the quote, i want to say that i like it.

and while applied mathematics isn't explicitly mentioned by engels, he does specifically state 'pure mathematics'. the question i guess would be: was there any distinction at that time?

since engels was born in 1820 it would be fair to say we had a few titans who were active in this time period, Lords [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|rayleigh]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|kelvin]] immediately coming to mind.

what do others think? i will admit i'm not a huge hardy fan, but that in no way affects my opinion on the relevance of the engels quote.

what do you think dr {{ping|David Eppstein}} ?

maybe some context around the quote would help, but it seems to stand well on its own. [[Special:Contributions/198.53.108.48|198.53.108.48]] ([[User talk:198.53.108.48|talk]]) 20:13, 12 June 2021 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
{{bcc|Peaceray|NekoKatsun|GreenComputer|Autumnking2012}}For years there has been dispute as to which pronouns this biography should use to refer to its subject. In 2017 {{u|Wilderwill}} edited the article to only refer to Barry by his surname (see {{slink||A_New_Solution_to_the_Pronouns_Issue}}), a compromise that saw no opposition (although also not much support). In the years since, that compromise has become the ''status quo''.

Notably, over the years, there has been no discussion of the applicability of [[MOS:GENDERID]], the guideline that governs biographical subjects' pronouns, which advises (emphases added):{{tqb|Refer to '''any person whose gender might be questioned''' with gendered words (e.g. pronouns, "man/woman", "waiter/waitress") that reflect the person's '''latest expressed gender self-identification''' as reported in the most recent reliable sources, even if it does not match what is most common in sources. This holds for any phase of the person's life, unless they have indicated a preference otherwise.}}

Much discussion in the past has focused on whether Barry was [[transgender]], but GENDERID is not exclusive to transgender people. '''It is not the goal of this RfC to determine whether Barry was transgender, or what his "true" gender identity was''' (or for that matter what his sex was). This RfC instead asks two questions:
# For the purposes of GENDERID, is it accurate to say that Barry's "latest expressed gender self-identification" was as a man?
# Should we follow GENDERID in this case?
("Yes" to both would mean switching to he/him pronouns.

{{rfcquote|text=
This is for not only this template, but all templates covering a international television edition of the ''Got Talent'' franchise. Under the section in this template denoted as "Other Notable Contestant", how should this field be defined by editors? Please answer with the following; more than one choice may be given, but please explain your reasoning:

*'''A''' The contestant made a notable career for themselves before appearing on a ''Got Talent'' programme.
*'''B''' The contestant became notable for their performance during their appearance on a ''Got Talent'' programme.
*'''C''' The contestant became notable for beginning a career after appearing on a ''Got Talent'' programme.

The need to define this section is due to the amount of Wikilinks being used in templates crafted with this section, such as [[Template:Britain's Got Talent]] and [[Template:America's Got Talent]]. Its need clear clarification to editors how this should be defined as in terms of relevant articles/subject matter. [[User:GUtt01|GUtt01]] ([[User talk:GUtt01|talk]]) 14:23, 8 July 2021 (UTC)}}

Later in 2021, 109.78.194.208 began removing it in several articles. At WikiProject Film, they [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Film&oldid=1029951595 brought up] the concern that the template might be abused. The WPFILM thread sees no resolution, and the template continues to be removed, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hellraiser:_Judgment&diff=1030039913&oldid=1027916296&diffmode=source in ''Hellraiser: Judgment's article] by 109.76.200.100.

So, what should happen to Film and game ratings:

A. Keep, and recommend it at [[MOS:FILM]] to widen usage, like in [[MOS:VG]]

B. Keep, and retain its optional fashion

C. Delete it

{{rfcquote|text=
I'm opening this RfC due to recent disruptive editing and because a known Hungarian user KIENGIR who participated in previous discussions has been banned earlier this year.

1) Infobox cleanup – keeping "National conservatism", "Social conservatism", "Right-wing populism", "Economic nationalism", "Euroscepticism" and "Anti-immigration" in the infobox including the present political position. Illiberalism itself isn't an ideology and the historical section can be instead moved to the introduction, in my opinion, they don't have to stay in the infobox. The source for Christian democracy is old and that label itself isn't used today to describe the party, but, if there are recent sources describing the party like that, then it can stay.

2) Right-wing → far-right – Should the infobox and introduction state the party as solely "far-right", or should the status quo remain?

3) Introduction – Regarding the introduction, it can be expanded to include their current and historical political positions and ideologies. The general question for this one is "Should illiberalism and authoritarianism get included in the introduction?" (eg. [[Law and Justice]]'s page).

While voting, use '''support''' and '''oppose''' in the subsections below. Discussing how the introduction should look can be discussed in the "Discussion" subsection below. --[[User:Vacant0|Vacant0]] ([[User talk:Vacant0|talk]]) 14:42, 25 June 2021 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Recently, I've come across an editor who is removing reference names from articles ''where the reference is only used once'' in the article. Thus <code><ref name=ABC123></code> becomes <code><ref></code>. This is not the same as consolidating references where a full reference is later repeated in full and is cut back to use the shortened ref name. The removal of named references is something I'm not comfortable with. Even if a reference is only used once, it is handy to have it named. Another editor may come along later and insert material so that the reference now needs to be used more than once. If it is named, the is is a simple matter of re-using the existing name. Without a name, the editor then needs to give the reference a name, and maybe also check for other uses of that reference elsewhere in the article. I appreciate that any "harm" done by these actions is minimal, and I'm not looking to get editors who have done this in the past sanctioned. What I would like to happen is that the issue is fully discussed and a consensus formed as to whether or not the practice of removing reference names should be deprecated. My preference is that if an editor has named a reference, then it should stay named. Others may feel different, but lets discuss this please.

Every couple of months, an editor adds child molester, sex offender, or similar, to either the first sentence of the article or the short description. All of these edits have been promptly reverted, and a group of regular editors argue against this. The argument against including this is that Savile was never tried in a court of law or convicted of such acts. The counter-argument is that his crimes weren't known until after his death (making a trial impossible) and all reliable sources describe as a child molester and that there is no serious doubt that he molested hundreds of children.

So the question for this RFC is: '''Should the first sentence of the article and the short description describe Savile as a child molester?''' [[User:Oiyarbepsy|Oiyarbepsy]] ([[User talk:Oiyarbepsy|talk]]) 02:10, 4 July 2021 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Hello all! While editing recent articles in Peruvian politics, especially regarding [[Pedro Castillo]] and the [[2021 Peruvian general election]], ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' was encountered on multiple occasions. There are some interesting interviews and articles written by ''Jacobin'', though there has not been a clear consensus on the reliability of the magazine as a source.

Previous discussions with dedicated sections were held, with the oldest being seen [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_302#Jacobin|here on Archive 302]], while in [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_324#Jacobin|Archive 324]] users shared that the reliability of ''Jacobin'' was between generally reliable and no consensus/addtional considerations after reviewing discussions from Archive 302.

Since it appears that ''Jacobin'' [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Jacobin_(magazine)&limit=500 has hundreds of links throughout the project], it is suggested that we determine the level of reliability of the source so it can be present on the [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources]] page.

Options are as follows:

*'''Option 1:''' The source is recognized as being [[WP:GREL|generally reliable]].
*'''Option 2:''' There is [[Wikipedia:MREL|no consensus or additional considerations apply]].
*'''Option 3:''' The source is recognized as being [[Wikipedia:GUNREL|generally unreliable]] in most cases, though it can be used under certain circumstances.
*'''Option 4:''' The source is recognized as being not reliable at all and should be [[Wikipedia:Deprecated sources|deprecated]]

{{rfcquote|text=
An RfC is being made to determine the scope and primary topic of the article.

This article currently deals with the engagement at Fort Saragarhi on 12 September 1897 in which 21 Sikh troops fought a last-stand battle against Afghans.

There were six forts around Fort Lockhart on the Samana Ridge (including Fort Saragarhi). They were spread over about 5 miles.  They were engaged by Afghans from about 28 August until 14 September [https://books.google.com/books?id=SAGzBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA20] (see also discussion above and article).

The current article makes passing comment about other engagements in the vicinity in the "Background" and "Aftermath" sections.

A position presented in preceding discussion is that all of the engagements occurring around this time are part of the "Battle of Saragarhi".  Consequently, the article would need to be rewritten to reflect a broadened scope and revised primary topic, which is not just the engagement at Saragarhi.

'''There are two questions (options):'''
#Should the status quo be retained with the present scope and primary topic being the engagement at Saragarhi on 12 September 1897?
#Should the scope and primary topic of the "Battle of Saragarhi" article be expanded to include other engagements in the Samana Ridge area between about 28 August to 14 September?

Suggest removing the '''Major figures''' criteria from [[Wikipedia:In_the_news/Recent_deaths#Blurbs_for_recent_deaths]]. It's a silly carry-over from when every death needed justification. There is no difference between a blurb or RD for a death except that a blurb pushes another item out of the box. If a person is truly a major figure, then they'd qualify for a blurb due to the "newsworthy reaction" to their passing as per '''Death as the main story'''.

'''''Did you know ...''' that articles nominated for [[WP:Did You Know]] often wait months for approval?''

Editors nominating an article for ''Did You Know'' generally must review someone else's nomination; this is called the QPQ (''[[quid pro quo]]''). But because new DYKers are allowed to make up to five nominations exempt from this requirement, there are always slightly more nominations coming in than reviews being performed, and over the years a large backlog has accumulated.

To reduce this backlog, so that nominations can be reviewed more promptly, DYK regulars have !voted to change the [[WP:Did_you_know#Review_requirement|rules for DYK's review requirement]]. Those rules currently provide
:''If, at the time a nomination is promoted to the main page, its nominator has fewer than 5 DYK credits (whether or not self-nominated) then the nomination is exempt from QPQ.''
The proposal is to substitute this text:
:''At the time a nomination is promoted to the main page''{{nbsp}}...
:* ''(a) if the nominator has fewer than 5 credits (whether or not self-nominated), no QPQ is required;''
:* ''(b) if the nominator has at least 5 credits but fewer than 20 credits, the nominator must do one QPQ;''
:* ''(c) if the nominator has 20 or more credits, the nominator must do two QPQs (if there's a backlog) or one QPQ (if not).''

Note: The above text is the result of extensive discussion [[#EEng's_alternative_for_addressing/preventing_the_unapproved_backlog|above]]. 18:43, 4 August 2021 (UTC)}}

There doesn’t seem to be anything controversial about the coverage that I’ve found so far, but I’m a bit unsure about its editorial standards and therefore accuracy.

i think the musician infobox is in great need of both the influence{s,d} parameters. that way we can trace pedigree of great musicians in the course of history.

it's no different than the scientist infobox. it gives us a great idea of who deserves to come before and after for specific musicians.

of course for jobber musicians it can be debated if they deserve this, but we can fight on those talk pages about whether they warrant them (maybe they're borderline [[WP:NOTABLE]] and thus don't deserve to piggyback on bigger names) [[Special:Contributions/198.53.108.48|198.53.108.48]] ([[User talk:198.53.108.48|talk]]) 01:38, 2 August 2021 (UTC)}}

For Australia, the two publications most frequently cited are ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]'', sister papers in Melbourne and Sydney that share some articles. However, they're currently missing from RSP. So, how should these be seen?

*'''Option 1:''' The source is recognized as being [[WP:GREL|generally reliable]].
*'''Option 2:''' There is [[Wikipedia:MREL|no consensus or additional considerations apply]].
*'''Option 3:''' The source is recognized as being [[Wikipedia:GUNREL|generally unreliable]] in most cases, though it can be used under certain circumstances.
*'''Option 4:''' The source is recognized as being not reliable at all and should be [[Wikipedia:Deprecated sources|deprecated]].

Please indicate in your !vote whether it applies to the ''SMH'', ''The Age'', or both. <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088">[[User:Sdkb|<span style="color:#FFF">'''Sdkb'''</span>]]</span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup>[[User talk:Sdkb|'''talk''']]</sup> 17:15, 12 August 2021 (UTC)}}

Request to add info box parameter: '''existing works'''

'''Description''': the number of existing or surviving paintings, drawings, engravings or other attributed art works 

The following info box parameter would tell how many paintings survived.  For example El Greco has 500 existing paintings. 

This will help historians understand how many paintings are attributed to each artist, Monet has 2500 existing works.  

'''existing works''' = 500 paintings survived

Hi. I would like to ask for your opinion about the reorganization of the '''defunct Italian parties'''. These parties are currently listed by dissolution date but divided into two lists (major and minor) and therefore into two chronological orders. I propose to list them by dissolution date <u>in a single chronological order</u>, eliminating the distinction between major and minor parties and adding the date of foundation and dissolution next to them in brackets. I propose eventually to divide them into institutional / political eras, as in the pages on the parties of other countries, for example: ''"Kingdom of Italy (1845–1946)"'', ''"First Republic (1946–1994)"'', ''"Second Republic (since 1994)"''.

See above discussion. 

All Reliable Sources refer to James the Just as a martyr. No one argues that James was not killed for his faith. WP defines [[Martyr]] as someone who suffers persecution and death for their beliefs. A martyrdom is not an ordinary death. I think that means ''all reliable sources'' say James the Just suffered persecution and death for his faith. Slatersteven believes the word persecution must be used and that martyrdom is not a sufficient simile for persecution to include James the Just here in this article [[Persecution of Christians]]. 

The question is: does the term martyrdom include the concept of persecution? [[User:Jenhawk777|Jenhawk777]] ([[User talk:Jenhawk777|talk]]) 19:43, 15 August 2021 (UTC)}}

This essay has repeatedly and historically been cited as policy at [[WP:Articles for Deletion]], but it is not actually an official policy endorsed as an [[WP:SNG]]. Likewise [[WP:CLERGYOUTCOMES]], has widely been cited at AFD without an underlying SNG supporting it as policy. It's my opinion that both this guide and [[WP:CLERGYOUTCOMES]] needs input from the wider community and not just editors who work frequently in this content area. I personally don't think religious leaders should be exempt from meeting the threshold of [[WP:SIGCOV]], and that presumed notability as indicated here should be overturned. Likewise the pro-Catholic and anti other religious sects bias in the policy is problematic as written and I think needs some scrutiny. If the community disagrees, then this guide or something similar should become an officially endorsed SNG rather than being an essay that in all practical purposes has been acting like an official SNG. Rather than crafting a proposal for voting off the bat, I would like to hear other's opinions first in order to craft a proposal that is likely to pass.

Hello, fellow members of WPTC. Today I come to you with my first big proposal: to make the track map website that {{ping|CodingCactus}} and I created ([https://trackgen.codingcactus.repl.co/ link]) an official generator alongside the one that people use. We believe it is now up to speed, with it being pretty much exactly like the other generator. It takes manual input, and can parse HURDAT, IBTrACS, ATCF, and JMA best track files. It is much easier to use than the current track map generator. I would appreciate it if you take a look and offer your own comments down below. Thank you.

Bringing ample secondary sources of the NYT's falling foul on climate change in the article lede (like the [[WSJ]] lede), they were deleted on grounds, all simply refuted just above. Sources intact, Administrators assert: "you may not re-insert this challenged content without consensus". 

I am not allowed to claim that this is censorship or unfair, or name anyone. I meekly accept that whatever sources I bring, will never be enough. Good sources, facts, parity of treatment are not relevant factors. 'Consensus' must be achieved, that magical mirage. What is the threshold for acceptance? Is this an open encylopedia or a doctrinal religion?

From my objective view, the changes that made English wiki article [[Pahonia]] redirect to [[Coat of Arms of Lithuania]] are mistaken. Emblem Pahonia was official emblem of [[Belarusian People's Republic]] in 1918 and [[Republic of Belarus]] in 1991-1995. It has no relevance to current "[[Vytis]]" of Lithuania. It also has no relevance to [[Coat of arms of Lithuania]]. That's why Pahonia has to be returned, as it also offends belarusians, 'cause this is officially intangible historical and cultural value  of Belarus, same as the national emblem of Belarus.

The emblem also has [[Slavic]] roots and name<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.belarusguide.com/as/history/pahonia.html}}</ref>. And is official emblem of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Grand duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, and Samogitia]]. Both Lithuania and Belarus are successors of the state, although emblem Pahonia([[Latin-language|lat.]] ''pogonia'', [[Ruthenian language|ruth.]] ''Погоня'') was ''mostly'' considered as slavic. Most of voivodeships in [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|GDL]] that were on the territories of modern Belarus have Pahonia on it<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldicum.ru/lietuva/voevod.htm}}</ref>. 

… According to ancient custom, the pursuit of the enemy is the duty of every man in our land; such a joint movement for the expulsion of the enemy from our Lithuanian land is popularly(by people) called "pogonia". - [[Jagailo]] in his privilegium of February 20, 1387.

Lithuanian names Vykimas and [[Vytis]] are [[Neologism|neologisms]], created in late XVIII-XIX centuries. None of official or unofficial documents of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|GDL]] or foreign countries have ever mentioned these names. And Vykimas is literal translation of Pogonia in lithuanian.

Josephus reports in the Antiquities of the Jews that High Priest Ananus ben Ananus took advantage of the death of Roman procurator Porcius Festus to have James the Just and others stoned to death. This act angered the new procurator Lucceius Albinus and the Jewish king Herod Agrippa II, who had Ananus deposed and replaced by Jesus ben Damneus.

And 

The first official hostile act of the Empire towards Jewish-Christians happened under the reign of Claudius: according to the Acts of the Apostles[2] and ancient historians Suetonius, Cassius Dio and Orosius, Claudius had both Jews and Jewish-Christians expelled from Rome because they were causing disturbances. Both groups were re-admitted in the Capital after Claudius's death.[[User:Slatersteven|Slatersteven]] ([[User talk:Slatersteven|talk]]) 15:16, 24 August 2021 (UTC)}}

Pratt replied the church wasn't because the church was open to everyone. Several actors defended Pratt.
}} 

I propose removing the Zoe Church section and putting it back to the ''Personal life'' section before it was changed in the latest controversy, recycling the best citations. 

There are other elements of his faith in the ''Personal life'' section, so I believe it will fit better there. --[[User:P37307|P37307]] ([[User talk:P37307|talk]]) 17:54, 31 July 2021 (UTC)}}

There have been some discussions about what nationality to list in the lead, but none that have had a lot of discussion. Listing three different nationalities is rarely done. The facts to keep in mind: he was born in New Zealand, however it's unclear if he has New Zealand citizenship because New Zealand doesn't have birthright citizenship. The article currently states that he does have New Zealand citizenship, but it is tagged as citation needed. Urban moved to Australia at a young age, grew up there, and started his career there and is sourced to have Australian citizenship. Urban's career however, didn't really take off until he moved to America in the 90s. Some time before the 2016 US election, Urban became an American citizen and voted in America for the first time that year. In [https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/328373-country-music-star-keith-urban-unsure-if-hed-accept-invitation this article], he says he has dual Australian-American citizenship, with no mention of New Zealand. With this in mind, which of the following options do you think is best to use in the lead? (If you have an alternative option, feel free to add it)
*'''Option 1''' ''New Zealand-born Australian-American'' 
*'''Option 2''' ''New Zealand-born Australian''
*'''Option 3''' ''Australian-American''
*'''Option 4''' ''Australian''

I would like to suggest that the "Legacy" section be solit into "YTS.AG and other unofficial clones" and "In popular culture". The reason for this is because i see a lot of editors and viewers confusing the old YIFY with the new YTS and having a section with YTS in the title will reduce this confusion greatly instead of it being hidden inside "Legacy". When it comes to this topic a lot of people are also unaware that YTS and YIFY are different entities and make first impression edits based on this. The article edit history is filled with these types of edits and is being constantly reverted.

'''Proposed modification''' to [[WP:BLOCK]]: 

That once an account is blocked by an administrator, other administrators must wait at least 24 hours before unblocking that account.

During the initial 24 hours, the account may only be unblocked by the initial blocking administrator or due to community consensus.

While unblock may be requested at any time by the account blocked, as normal - as stated above, during the initial 24 hours, the request can not be approved except by the initial blocking admin, or by community consensus.

(Note: This does not affect anything “above” the admin level, like arbcom taking over a block, or steward action, etc.) 

------------------------------
'''Added for clarity:''' The initially blocking admin (just like the community) can obviously give consent that some other uninvolved admin may unblock during that initial 24 hour period (such as specifically asking for help with a technical blocking issue). In such a case, they do not have to be the one to actually press the unblock button. They can also set clear criteria for unblocking, such as: "If xyz is done, then any uninvolved admin may unblock", such as in the case of a username block.. - <b>[[User:Jc37|jc37]]</b> 19:30, 18 August 2021 (UTC)}}

BMI categories are defined by ranges of numbers per this reliable source ([https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43190/9241593024_eng.pdf The SuRF Report 2], p. 22), which uses two decimal precision (e.g. Overweight: 25.00-29.99; Obese I: 30.00-34.99). Some feel "29.999", etc. are "gaps" unaccounted for that can cause confusion and feel it unscientific and want to include all numbers by rounding the upper limits/boundaries (25-30; 30-35) implying ranges that exclude the upper limit (30 and 35 respectively) and barely "touch" the next category's lower limit. Others feel worrying about "29.99X" unnecessary, [[MOS:RANGE]] includes the upper limit, "30" in two categories is inaccurate and a confusing "overlap", and we should stick to [[WP:RS]] with one decimal precision being clear enough (25.0-29.9; 30.0-34.9).

So this has been on ongoing issue for a while with editors changing her name from one to the other, I feel we should come to some consensus and sort the issue once and for all. I feel, as the article is titled '''Carla Connor''', the lede should begin with '''Carla Connor''' (also '''Barlow''' and '''Gordon''').

There's been a difficultly amongst editors regarding the statement "Sixty-nine states have signed declarations in statements at the UNGA affirming that the Holodomor was as a 'national tragedy of the Ukrainian people'..." The issue is whether it is OK to count the number of countries from the UN General Assembly statements from 4 documents [https://undocs.org/A/C.3/58/9], [https://undocs.org/A/C.3/58/9/Add.1], [https://undocs.org/A/63/613], [https://undocs.org/A/68/655], and [https://undocs.org/A/73/630]. No primary or secondary sources lists the count, however per [[WP:CALC]] routine calculations are allowed.

To be honest, I was the skeptical editor and didn't trust the 69 number for the longest time. It's an utter pain trying to calculate all the unique countries, so I wrote a Python script to do it[https://pastebin.com/cQ4vVzTu]. I'm still not 100% sure if I'm correct. I've never seen a page try to do this, so I'm worried that it's OR.

There are a few options:
*'''A: Keep the text as 69 (or 70), explicitly listing the number'''
*'''B: Write "at least 69 (or 70)"'''
*'''C: Change it to "many countries" or something similar''' [[User:Stix1776|Stix1776]] ([[User talk:Stix1776|talk]]) 08:09, 30 May 2021 (UTC)}}

I would like some other editors to comment on what seems to me a rather bizarre claim made by User:Bluesatellite about “Elvis” allegedly not being a mononym. I have tried to use tbe talk page and converse with the user, but he just keeps removing the information from the article, and simply expressed an opinion without any sources to back up his claim. Oh, and to make matters worse, he has had the audacity to warn me on my talk page. Anyway, according to the user, if “Elvis” were a mononym then the title of the article would only be “Elvis”, but that isn’t the definition of a mononym. A mononymous person is someone known by a single name and Elvis Presley since he became a global superstar in the 1950s has been known by his unusual name Elvis without any need for his surname to be mentioned. The information “also known simply as Elvis” has been included in the article as far back as 2019 without any problems whatsoever. User:Bluesatellite made the false analogy between Elvis Presley and Mariah Carey - the former has always been known by his first name whereas the latter has always been known by her full name. There are lots of mononymous people that people know the surnames of as well - Oprah (Winfrey), Kylie (Minogue), Beyoncé (Knowles), etc. I have provided reliable sources stating that “Elvis” is a mononym and that his surname “Presley” was explicitly omitted to make that point. Go anywhere in the world and say “Elvis” and people will know which person you are on about straightaway. The [[Kylie Minogue]] article and many other articles (see above) state “also known simply as” followed by that person’s name. The user’s false analogy and opinions are not relevant or carry any weight - I have provided reliable sources to back up the claim and I don’t see why someone is trying to create a problem that isn’t even there.--[[User:Emily19911991|Emily19911991]] ([[User talk:Emily19911991|talk]]) 11:10, 8 September 2021 (UTC)}}

There is a longtime dispute regarding the first sentence of [[Ramones]], specifically, whether it should begin as "{{tq|The '''Ramones'''}}" or "{{tq|'''Ramones'''}}". [[WP:THE|Current policy regarding the naming conventions of music groups]] doesn't appear to adequately address disputes regarding the use of [[definite articles]] in an unofficial capacity.

It's universally agreed that the band is officially known as "Ramones" because that is how they are credited on their CDS, audiotapes, and records. However, most other publications refer to this band as "the Ramones". Interviews reveal that the members of the group also refer to their band with a definite article in everyday speech. [https://www.artistwd.com/joyzine/music/ramones/joey.php] [https://punkrockinterviews.com/interview-with-marky-ramone-from-the-remainz-the-ramones/] Other articles, such as [[Electric Light Orchestra]] and [[Nazz]], take the same approach being proposed in this RfC.

This is not an RfC about changing the title of the article, but in how Wikipedia writes about this band and others with similar naming disputes.

Should we use Vice Ganda's last name, ''Viceral,'' or his stage name, ''Vice Ganda'', to refer to him in the article? "Viceral" as a last name is not really a last name that is notable for Vice Ganda, with not many people knowing her by said last name. There are also instances in articles where a stage name is used to refer to someone instead of their real last name, namely, [[Megan Thee Stallion]]. Would like to hear people's thoughts on this, thanks.

There are fighters in this list like [[Anderson Silva]] and [[José Aldo]] who use Muay Thai heavily in their MMA fighters.
However I'm not sure if they can be still considered "Muay Thai based fighters" because they also trained a lot in other areas.

This is in contrast to fighters like [[Valentina Shevchenko]] and [[Joanna Jędrzejczyk]] where we can see have spent a lot of time in  Muay Thai itself gain huge accomplishments before switching to Mixed Martial Arts.

Should we allow fighters in the former to appear in this list or keep it strictly to only fighters from the latter?

anybody can provide a reference with certain that congenital hymen absence is scientifically proved.

Should we remove the minor parties and independents section? The [[National Revolutionary Dividends Party]] has no elected representation at any level in South Korea and from what I can see from the opinion polls their candidate hasn't even appeared in any polls. As for the [[Progressive Party (South Korea, 2017)|Progressive Party]] we don't even have a confirmed candidate for them and they also have no elected members in the National Assembly. The Progressive Party's predecessor ([[People's United Party (South Korea)]]) finished in 8th place in the last South Korean presidential election in 2017 with 0.08% of the vote. These parties don't seem to be notable in this election unless their candidates at least begin to appear in opinion polls. The citation for the National Revolutionary Dividends Party may also be a first party source although I'm not sure and as for the Progressive Party we don't even have a citation talking about them running in this election or any of their potential candidates.

'''Background:'''

Currently, a candidate must receive more than 5% to appear in most US election infoboxes. This is a good standard and I do not agree with changing it. 

'''Proposal:'''

If a candidate wins a county in a statewide election, they should appear in the infobox. Currently, winning a county doesn't necessarily guarantee that a candidate goes in the infobox. This results in the candidate's name appearing in the map caption but no other information like their % of the vote, # of votes, party, picture, and full name. For example, the [[1976 United States Senate election in Virginia]] saw Martin Perper win a county but not appear in the infobox due to only receiving 4.5% of the vote. This makes the infobox a bit confusing to look at because there is no other mention of Perper besides the map caption

This would be an easy change to make because only a few elections have seen candidates win counties and not get more than 5% of the vote. [[User:MrOinkingPig|MrOinkingPig]] ([[User talk:MrOinkingPig|talk]]) 21:02, 16 August 2021 (UTC)}}

Statement:
Should the following text be in the article?

On 26 June 2021, Stundin, an Icelandic newspaper, reported that a key witness in the United States’ case against Assange had admitted to giving false testimony used in the superseding U.S. indictment. The witness, Sigurdur Thordarson, told the paper he fabricated earlier testimony that Assange had instructed him to hack into the computers of members of Iceland's parliament, as well as other allegations. Thordarson said he had been working with the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI in return for a promise the agencies would not share with Icelandic authorities information that could lead to a prosecution of Thordarson. According to the interview, Thordarson continued his criminal activities while working with the FBI with the promise of immunity from prosecution.[462] The Washington Post reported that Thordarson's testimony served as background for what Assange allegedly told Manning. The paper noted that supporters including Edward Snowden have said the admission of fabricated testimony undermines the case against Assange. However, their report states that the interview does not touch on the core allegations against Assange.[463] Private Eye states that the claims from the witness feature extensively in the UK court judgement, and that the U.S. hacking charges rely heavily on the testimony that the witness now admits was fabricated.[464][[User:Slatersteven|Slatersteven]] ([[User talk:Slatersteven|talk]]) 09:57, 18 August 2021 (UTC)}}

Myself & {{ping|Lecen}} are in dispute as to how the names [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], [[Peter III of Portugal|Peter III]], [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] & [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] should be displayed in this article. IMHO, they should be shown in their ''english form'', per their respective ''article titles'' (see [[WP:COMMONNAME]]), where's Lecen argues they should be shown (pipe-linked or redirect) in their ''portuguese form''.

{{rfcquote|text=
A law in Texas, effective 1 September 2021, requires abortion providers to try to detect an embryonic or fetal heartbeat, and prohibits them from performing the abortion if the heartbeat is detected, except for medical emergencies. Normally it's possible to detect a heartbeat about 6 weeks after the last menstrual period. Most women tend to find out that they are pregnant after this time, thus missing the legal opportunity to abort, but if they find out earlier they are still allowed. Given these circumstances, how should Texas and the United States be shown in [[abortion law]]? (See the article for the meaning of the colors.)
*'''Option 1''': In the table, mark the last 4 columns of Texas in light red, and the last 4 columns of the United States in yellow, with notes explaining the details. In the map, mark Texas in orange, and the rest of the United States in blue.

This discussion will be applied to the following articles:
* [[2002 Winter Olympics]]
* [[Short track speed skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics – Men's 1500 metres]]
* [[Kim Dong-sung]]
* [[Apolo Ohno]]
* [[James Hewish]]

{{Reply to|188.65.246.175}} I still believe that [[Kim Dong-sung]] unfairly lost the gold medal thanks to [[James Hewish]]'s misjudgement and [[Apolo Ohno]]'s simulated foul that led to it. But I tried my best at maintaining NPOV while I was revising the paragraphs in question days ago to best describe what actually happened (or what appeared to happen) back in 2002. If you still think my writing was biased, why don't you reword them to adhere to what you think was neutral, instead of reverting them outright?

Also, while I was on it, I replaced some dead and/or questionable Korean language sources with remaining and/or credible ones.

And I moved the detailed writings about the incident from the [[Apolo Ohno]] article to [[Short track speed skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics – Men's 1500 metres]] because I think it's better suited in the article about the event, while the article about the American skater can focus on Ohno's feelings and later remarks about the incident. --[[Special:Contributions/175.124.86.89|175.124.86.89]] ([[User talk:175.124.86.89|talk]]) 12:23, 24 August 2021 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
There is currently a dispute about could Amrullah Saleh become president as successor of former president per Afghan constitution and what sources could be used to prove that. It regards important note that in article should be to described how Amrullah Saleh obtained his highest public function.  What sources for such edit exists and how they could be used?

Could we add in article -
"under Afghanistan constitution article 60 Vice President can become president in case when president is absent as he is direct successor" 

with support of primary and other secondary source regarding constitution 

or simply add he is 

"president per Afghanistan constitution" 

as it is supported by many sources or both as one part is regarding ways of succession and other is actual state. Is constitution reliable as a primary source when used with care and backed by secondary sources that confirm that it is used with care - is it good for editing when it comes to legal matters that should be very strict in this case to describe succession possibility.

I am trying to improve article to add statement that it is possible for vice president of Afghanistan to become president according to constitution including maybe some legal quotes or statement about succession.

Primary source - Afghan constitution - is at my opinion here in this situation best available source in terms of reliability about succession while one secondary source exists that confirms that First Vice President of Afghanistan becomes President under constitution

Should the article [[Julian Assange]] include the following information, sourced to ''The Daily Telegraph'', ''The Guardian'', ''The Times'' and ''Yahoo News'':

According to former intelligence officials, following the Vault&nbsp;7 leaks senior officials in the CIA discussed plans to either [[kidnapping|kidnap]] Assange from the embassy or assassinate him, going so far as to request "sketches" or "options" for doing so. No plans were approved, partly because White House lawyers raised concerns about the legality of such an operation. Some officials, interviewed as part of an investigation by ''[[Yahoo News]]'', stated that they were sufficiently concerned about the proposals that they alerted staffers and members of the House and Senate intelligence committees.

The central argument is completeness: Several editors (including myself) use this guideline to determine where to place various elements, and the lack of a common template type like DISPLAYTITLE is destined to cause inconsistencies. There was no concurrence on ''where'' these elements should be placed within the list of elements.

{{rfcquote|text=
This page includes many entries about supposed hoaxes that do not meet the inclusion criteria (quoting from this very article: "For the purpose of this list, a hoax is defined as '''a clear and deliberate attempt to deceptively present false information as fact'''."). And from [[WP:HOAX]] "A hoax is an attempt to trick an audience into believing that something false is real". Also, please note this is not a wiki-jargon issue: from [[Hoax]]: "a falsehood deliberately fabricated to masquerade as the truth", CED [https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hoax] "a plan to deceive someone". The key issue is that a hoax needs to be '''deliberate''', but we don't have any proof that this is the case for many entries here, most of which are just various errors - but ones that could've been added in good faith. Calling them hoaxes violates [[WP:AGF]] and creates a misleading impression that many errors on Wikipedia are deliberate - a violation of [[Hanlon's razor]], better known as the adage "never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity". Please read below for a more detailed analysis. --<sub style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;">[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|<span style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;"> reply here</span>]]</sub> 12:39, 7 September 2021 (UTC)}}

There is currently a lack of consensus as to which countries the geographical descriptor of [[North Africa]] should include. This region is messy, with the [[Maghreb]], [[Northwestern Africa]], [[Northeastern Africa]] and [[Middle East]] regional groupings all overlapping. One question that has been discussed extensively on this page in various forms, but lingered unresolved for decades, is whether to include [[Sudan]]. At present, the principle source that includes Sudan in its definition of North Africa is the UN Statistics Division, which uses the UN geo-scheme as its basis. However, the African Union, World Bank, Encylopedia Britannica sources and others exclude it. Sudan is also included as part of [[Northeastern Africa]] and the [[Sahel]] group of countries, and, in some sources, as part of [[East Africa]]. Again, it is principally the UN Statistics Division that excludes it from East Africa. Should Sudan be included in North Africa? Please comment below.

Prior to 2016, Nation of Islam (NoI) was a NPOV article that recognized NoI's hate group status in the opening paragraph. More recently it has morphed into a sales pitch. The two main authorities on hate groups in the United States, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] and the [[Anti-Defamation League]] are dismissed as "critics" rather than being recognized as reliable sources as they are in well written hate group articles such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. At least one police officer has been murdered since Wikipedia stop recognizing NoI as a hate group and started promoting it via a sales pitch. The NYT reports:

"Noah Green, the knife-wielding man killed after ramming his car into a checkpoint at the U.S. Capitol on Friday, was a troubled former college athlete whose life was disintegrating in the months leading up to a violent outburst that left one officer dead and another injured.

On the football field at Christopher Newport University in Virginia, Noah R. Green was No. 21, a dependable and good-natured, if soft-spoken, presence in the defensive backfield. Off the field, he was focused on Black economic empowerment and planned a career to help close the racial wealth gap.

By late March, after a bruising pandemic year that friends and family said left him isolated and mentally unmoored, Mr. Green’s life appeared increasingly to revolve around the Nation of Islam and its leader Louis Farrakhan, who has repeatedly promoted anti-Semitism." https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/us/politics/heres-what-we-know-about-the-man-behind-fridays-attack-on-capitol-hill.htm

I'm working with Ted to redesign his website and offered to post information about him on Wikipedia. He provided all the content and I vetted, assembled and published this article. We have done our best to include extra citations where possible to validate Ted's description, and have satisfied ourselves that his entry is within the WikiProject Biography and biographies of living persons, which appears to have been validated by another reviewer. As such, we want to find out how to have the qualifying banner at the top of this page removed or adjusted to reflect sincere efforts to make this a neutral, correct and worthy article.

Can I get some direction please on what to do or how to get assistance so this article does not convey a sense of suspicion or lack of credibility? Otherwise, I have also asked about assistance draftifying or otherwise moving this article to a space where more time can be spent to get it up to article standards/requirements.

{{rfcquote|text=
There is some dispute on the [[chiropractic]] talk page about the removal of stroke/vertebral dissection as risks in the article's infobox. Presently, this discussion is hinging partially on the reliability/neutrality of a source. The source is a MEDRS compliant source with in-universe authors, but published by an out of universe journal. I contend that the peer review process of the medical journal neutralizes much of the risk of bias due to an all-medical review board and that it should be included because it is MEDRS compliant. The opposing contention is that the article is unreliable because it is written by in-universe authors.

This source from ''IGN'' writer Christopher Marc has been previously [[User talk:Some Dude From North Carolina/Archive 4#Wonka|discussed at my talk page]]. One editor sites a [[Talk:Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness#The Ronin|claim]] that the source cannot be used because it is run by one person. On my talk page, others say it can be used because Marc has connections to the industry from his work for ''IGN''. I also believe the source is reliable because most of his reports have proven true across several film and television topics. So, I am looking for a consensus.

In 2011, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_(New_Zealand)/Archive_1#Dual_and_alternative_place_names following a discussion between two editors], the following paragraph was added to the New Zealand-specific naming convention guidelines. Is there a consensus to '''keep''' it or '''remove''' it?

{{tq|'''Dual names.''' If there are sources that indicate that a dual name has usage beyond mandatory official usage, put the article at the dual name, with redirects from each of the component names. The redirects may require disambiguation, but it is highly unlikely that the dual name will be ambiguous. The date of renaming should be noted and sourced in the article. Links to the article need not use the dual name unless it is appropriate, and the dual name should not be used where historically inaccurate (e.g. a historical reference before the renaming). If sources do not support use of the dual name, the English name will almost certainly be the one in common usage.}}

The background to this is that in New Zealand many place names (currently 425) officially have a dual name consisting of names derived from both European and Māori origins; for example, since 2013 ''"Cape Reinga"'' is now officially ''"Cape Reinga / Te Rerenga Wairua"''. Government and government related or owned bodies such as Crown entities are required to use the full "dual name" in written documents, but the public are not required to do so.

Should there be no consensus, or a consensus to keep with alterations, a second RfC will be held to determine what alterations are necessary. 07:19, 27 September 2021 (UTC)}}

[[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (government and legislation)#Elections and referendums]] claims to contain guidelines as to how to title articles about such democratic exercises. However, it appears to be a guideline which is not in sync with practice and which sometimes even leads to results which are outright contrary to the [[WP:TITLE]] policy.

Thus, I propose that all relevant phrases of NCELECT be altered to reflect actual usage, i.e. elections should be at [Date] [location name ''or'' adjective] [election], with the preference being left to other considerations of the article title policy (notably [[WP:COMMONNAME]]).

I came across this article while reading up on Panchen Lama selection. I was a little surprised to see some text (about the purpose of the golden urn selection process being to prevent cheating) had been replicated verbatim in this and a couple related articles. I notice the user responsible for that text has made substantial contributions to multiple related pages, including deleting Golden Urn's "controversy" section wholesale. I'm not familiar with the subject matter or Wikipedia's policies (or, on a meta level, whether this is the right way to ask for help) but it seems like they might benefit from a set of eyeballs familiar with the neutral point of view policy. <span class="autosigned" style="font-size:85%;">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:69.215.157.199]] ([[User talk:69.215.157.199#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/69.215.157.199|contribs]]) 06:09, 29 October 2021 (UTC)}}

*The lead of the article is not following Wikipedia guidelines for the lead. The first sentence contains almost 50 words, which compromise the readability of the lead. Also the lead, instead of introducing the subject, is giving a conclusion on his lifework.

*Subhas Chandra Bose(/ʃʊbˈhɑːs ˈtʃʌndrə ˈboʊs/ (About this soundlisten) shuub-HAHSS CHUN-drə BOHSS; 23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945) was an Indian nationalist. He served as leader and commander of Indian National Army (Azad Hind Fauj ) during 1943-1945. Often called as Netaji (Hindustani: "Respected Leader"), the honorific title was given to Bose in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin, Germany. His defiant patriotism made him a hero in India, but his attempts during World War II to rid India of British rule with the help of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a troubled legacy.

The proposal is to move the following sentences out of the ethnic groups sub-section and to the end of the paragraph at the start of the demography section: "The census results are contested by the Republika Srpska statistical office and by Bosnian Serb politicians.[140] The dispute over the census concerns the inclusion of non-permanent Bosnian residents in the figures, which Republika Srpska officials oppose.[141] The European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, concluded in May 2016 that the census methodology used by the Bosnian statistical agency is in line with international recommendations.[142]" and to add something like "The RS statistical office has published its own, rival version of the results". Suggested references: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nana.12500, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17449057.2020.1821335 and https://www.sarajevotimes.com/republika-srpska-published-census-results/.

This is necessary because it's not only the results on ethnicity that are contested - the RS government claims that there are fewer people overall in the country than the state-level statistics office and uses its own results on the territory of the RS.

Evidence that Utada continues to use feminine pronouns (i.e. she/her) keeps increasing. Not only does the [https://www.utadahikaru.jp/en/profile/ profile] on her personal website ''still'' use feminine pronouns, but recent news items on there do as well:

*{{tq|Hikaru Utada recently has announced her first tie-up with a TBS drama series in four years.}} [https://www.utadahikaru.jp/en/news/detail.html?id=534178 October 15]
*{{tq|The last time Hikaru Utada marked the US Billboard charts was 2019, for her first time in the Billboard Hot 100...}} [https://www.utadahikaru.jp/en/news/detail.html?id=532821 September 1]

She has never said or implied her pronouns are they/them, and that her personal website uses she/her shows that that is what is in accord with her self-identification per [[MOS:GENDERID]]. The website would ''not'' use them if she did not. It is ''not'' true that being non-binary means a person uses they/them. Many non-binary people are open to any pronouns, or use "she/they" or "he/they" (meaning both are good); some may even just use the binary pronouns. Being non-binary also does not mean that one sees oneself as non-feminine.

The only arguments I can see against using she/her are original research or POV. All the evidence of self-identification as specified by GENDERID comes down on the side of she/her. The fact that she never said anything about pronouns also strongly implies she never desired a change from the she/her pronouns used in the past.

Also, I remember reading somewhere recently that in Japanese, even the first-person pronouns ("I", "me") are gendered. {{u|Hijiri88}}, since you know the language, any evidence from that angle? <span style="font-family:Palatino">[[User:Crossroads|'''Crossroads''']]</span> <sup>[[User talk:Crossroads|-talk-]]</sup> 20:58, 24 October 2021 (UTC)}}

Propose to summarize [[Julian Assange#2016 U.S. presidential election]] section that is subject of extended [[WP:TE]]
 
'''Option A'''. Proposed text: "During the U.S. 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, WikiLeaks hosted a searchable database of emails sent or received by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State. The emails had been released by the US State Department under a Freedom of information request in February 2016 and were widely cited in press during the election. Assange spoke negatively of both candidates stating "The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers." On 7 October, Assange posted a press release on WikiLeaks exposing the second batch of emails, these from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The Oct 7 email leak was attributed to the Russian government but Assange stated the Russian government was not the source of the DNC and Podesta emails, and accused the Clinton campaign of "a kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria" about Russian involvement."

'''Option B'''. Summarize to any other one-paragraph summary of similar size to Option A that contains no quotations of anyone except the article subject. (There is no need to add additional proposed paragraphs to this RFC, that can be done is a subsequent RFC if necessary.)

'''Option C'''. Leave it as is or expand it.

Soul singer and writer [[Sam Cooke]] did a cover of the song "Unchained Melody" in 1960, as one can see [https://www.google.com/search?q=Sam+Cooke%27s+version+of+Unchained+Melody&oq=Sam+Cooke%27s+version+of+Unchained+Melody&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i22i29i30l8.15538j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 here], and which version gained somewhat popularity, but not as much as that made by the "Righteous Brothers."

Should cover songs have separate sections in articles if they only list chart positions? According to one view: "separated sections and chart tables for each cover are almost always use in song articles to prove these covers are actually notable and do meet [[:WP:SONGCOVER]]"?[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AWhole_Lotta_Love&type=revision&diff=1049574401&oldid=1049570502]  This has been used to justify repeating chart info already included in prose, by adding a separate section using subsections with a series of chart tables for each cover. 

Other applicable guidelines include [[:MOS:OVERSECTION]] ("Very short sections and subsections clutter an article with headings and inhibit the flow of the prose") and [[:MOS:NO-TABLES]] ("If a list is simple, it is generally better to use one of the standard Wikipedia list formats instead of a table. Lists are easier to maintain than tables, and are often easier to read.")

'''Keeping it very concise this instance:''' While it's understandable that no list on this site is meant to be exhaustive, but I noticed that some arguably notable titles, with articles of their own, are missing from the list. However, I also see that it's thus far confined to the [[Boston|City of Boston]] and not the greater [[Greater Boston]] area as a whole. Since the adjoining urban agglomerations and even counties in said tri-state zone are most likely not notable enough to merit a "<Name> in fiction" listicle of their own, should the scope of this article be expanded? Thereby also avoiding any potential future-dispute over additions, relevant to the geographic-expanse? Also, so far the indication of this listicle appears to be that its merit is only to cover titles which has their narrative, whether scripted or "unscripted" (unless it's a settled policy-question for "[[WP:TV]]" that reality TV can't be defined as “fiction” whatsoever; mockumentaries, no matter how extremely reliant on ad-libbing/improv, are already out-of-consideration), set in a "real" or fictionalized region. But what if say, a project that [principally] films in Boston but: Is in fact set in some fantastical/mythical or futuristic (hitherto-undeveloped) location? Should those titles be also be disqualified for inclusion because they take place at somebody "elsewhere" than anywhere resembling Boston, even if the restriction for disqualifying the titles which are produced in the area but in fact set in other real-life location[s] of the world, is also taken out of consideration? –[[Special:Contributions/103.163.124.73|103.163.124.73]] ([[User talk:103.163.124.73|talk]]) 00:50, 5 November 2021 (UTC)}}

Prabook.com is an openly editable wiki that describes itself as a place to make a encyclopedic profile for any person, not just those notable enough to be included in an encyclopedia like Wikipedia. It’s content is a mix of automatically scraped details from other sources, and contributions from anonymous editors. It allows individuals to “lock” a profile, but has no mechanism to ensure it is only locked by the subject of the profile.

This iteration of Prabook.com appears to be founded in 2018 (per [[Valery Tsepkalo#Prabook]]), but there are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Prabook&prefix=Wikipedia%3AReliable+sources%2FNoticeboard&fulltext=Search+the+noticeboard+archives&fulltext=Search&ns0=1 earlier posts at RSN] about a similar-sounding website.

How should we list it on [[WP:RSP]]?

* '''Option 1:''' Generally reliable for factual reporting
* '''Option 2:''' Additional considerations apply. For example, do not used to satisfy [[Wikipedia:Notability]], only for [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]].
* '''Option 3:''' Generally unreliable for factual reporting
* '''Option 4:''' Publishes false, fabricated, or unverifiable information, and should be deprecated

I have already removed it from several articles where I’ve found it used as a source, but would like to formally propose deprecating it per [[WP:USERGENERATED]].

In keeping with the comments above that my previous RFC was insufficiently, I am opening a new one to replace it.

As I have mentioned here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:%C3%89ric_Zemmour&diff=prev&oldid=1049175921] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3A%C3%89ric_Zemmour&type=revision&diff=1049539640&oldid=1049523020] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:%C3%89ric_Zemmour&diff=next&oldid=1049564037] and edited here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C3%89ric_Zemmour&diff=prev&oldid=1043876971] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C3%89ric_Zemmour&diff=prev&oldid=1049026741], I consider it appropriate for the term 'polemicist' to appear from the first paragraph, as it cited by tens of different reliable sources. As far I am concerned, it's the main thing he is known for. It is also uncontested on the French version of the page. 

As I mentioned here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3A%C3%89ric_Zemmour&type=revision&diff=1051014223&oldid=1051012600], the word 'pundit' was added to replace the word 'polemicist'. The editor argued that 'pundit' would be a better translation for 'polémiste' than polemicist', which is contrary to Robert Collins French-English English-French dictionary and contrary to what is found on [[wikt:polémiste]]. As I mentioned here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3A%C3%89ric_Zemmour&type=revision&diff=1051012600&oldid=1050998368], some of the many sources which support the word 'polemicist' are still in the article, it's just the description associated has been changed.

An IP address above has suggested the option of putting in the third - the second, as I mistakenly stated above - sentence instead of the first. This may be a compromise option, but the word 'polémiste' is the word most used to describe Eric Zemmour that it would be inappropriate not to have it.

This RFC attempts to gain consensus on the wording of the first half of the opening sentence, which at time of writing reads: "The LGB Alliance is a British advocacy group and registered charity[neutrality is disputed] founded in 2019". A number of other forms of words have been proposed on this talk page. Some of these forms of words are not mutually exclusive (e.g. one could say it was an advocacy group, a hate group, a registered charity AND something else as well).

Given that there has been edit warring over the lead image, I think it's due time for an RfC. Two images are being considered for the lead- the former was taken in September 2017, while the latter was taken in August 2018. 
* Proponents of the 2017 image say it is better because Minaj is looking forward at the camera, the lighting is better centered on Minaj's face, and it is also a more flattering photo.
* Proponents of the 2018 image say it is more recent, of a higher resolution, and Minaj is in a standing position.
For more examples of these type of lead image discussions, please look at [[Talk:Kelly_Clarkson#Image_change]] as an example. Thank you.

Most coverage of Rowling in the media over the last couple of years has focused on her anti-trans views. It seems fair to say that she is primarily known as 1) the former author of the Harry Potter book series and 2) for her anti-trans activism and views. In light of that it would be reasonable for the first sentence to reflect that, especially given how it includes far more obscure descriptors such as "philanthropist, film producer, television producer, and screenwriter" (activities that have received comparatively little media coverage). Perhaps some of those obscure descriptors should also be removed from the first sentence, and only be mentioned further down? --[[User:Amanda A. Brant|Amanda A. Brant]] ([[User talk:Amanda A.

Should the lead sentence of this article mention Rowling's involvement in controversies about trans issues (roughly defined) and if so, how should it be mentioned?

'''Option A''': Do not mention them in the lead sentence.

'''Option B''': Mention them as a direct statement about Rowling's views, e.g., "anti-transgender activist". 

'''Option C''': Mention the controversy without making a direct statement about Rowling's views, e.g. "who has received criticism for statements that have widely been considered transphobic". 

Hopefully specific options help clear up the disorganized discussion above. As I see it, there is consensus to keep mention of her other activities (e.g. producer) in the lead sentence, and only notable disagreement about the trans part. <span style="background-color:#20B2AA;padding: 2px 3px 1px 3px">[[User:A._C._Santacruz|<span style="color:#fff">Santacruz</span>]] <span style="color:#fff">&#8258;</span> [[User talk:A._C._Santacruz|<span style="color:#fff">Please tag me!</span>]]</span> 15:57, 25 November 2021 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Prior to 2016, Nation of Islam (NoI) was a NPOV article that recognized NoI's hate group status in the opening paragraph. More recently it has morphed into a sales pitch. The two main authorities on hate groups in the United States, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League are dismissed as "critics" rather than being recognized as reliable sources as they are in well written hate group articles such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. SPL was the sole source cited for the opening paragraph of the KKK article prior to Oct. 25 2021. 

RFC Question: Should the following be restored to the opening paragraph:

The NOI is tracked as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

This is an issue not exclusive to the biography of Kim Dae-jung but also the biography of all Koreans who born and died in Korea under Japanese rule (1910-1945).

'''Should birth locations and death locations in [[Korea under Japanese rule]] be referred to as in:'''
*'''A''' - "Chōsen", one of the English names given to the territory by the Japanese Empire during annexation. This name was internationally recognized during the annexation. This is the current naming convention across Wikipedia.

This name was internationally recognized during annexation. "Korea" is also the modern English name of the territory since after WWII.

R. Kelly was previously listed as spouse in Aaliyah's infobox for years until it was recently removed. This is a sensitive topic for fans of Aaliyah, but Wikipedia isn't a fan page, it's an encyclopedia. There is a section detailing their illegal marriage, so readers are well-informed that she was underaged, but if her parents filed for annulment on her behalf, that means she had a spouse. Many other celebrities have had a marriage annulled and their spouse is still mentioned in their infobox, it's just specified that they had an annulment instead of a divorce. For example [[Renée Zellweger]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Pamela Anderson]]. Aaliyah is also mentioned as a spouse in R. Kelly's infobox. This inclusion isn't to romanticize their relationship, but it has been heavily documented, so should R. Kelly be added as a spouse?[[User:Twixister|Twixister]] ([[User talk:Twixister|talk]]) 06:58, 11 December 2021 (UTC)}}

For years now editors have disagreed on whether to use the word 'federal' as prefix on articles related to Austrian politics and public administration (especially when it comes to the [[President of Austria|president]], the [[Chancellor of Austria|chancellor]], and the [[List of Ministries (Austria)|ministries]]), e.g. [[Ministry of the Interior (Austria)]], [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Austria)]].

Arguments for omission: 
:1) [[User:Kramler]] has written an [[User:Kramler/Federal translation repair|essay on why it is misleading to use the prefix]] from a legal and scholarly perspective 2) The vast majority of English language sources omit 'federal' (examples: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/09/sebastian-kurz-to-quit-as-austrian-chancellor-due-to-corruption-inquiry?utm_term=Autofeed&CMP=twt_b-gdnnews&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1633805503 1] [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58856796 2] [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/austria-kurz-resigns-corruption/2021/10/09/fd58ac5a-2927-11ec-8739-5cb6aba30a30_story.html 3] [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/09/world/europe/austrian-chancellor-sebastian-kurz-resigns.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur 4] [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/11/schallenberg-takes-office-as-opposition-say-kurz-remains-in-charge.html 5] [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/austrian-presidential-vote-won-left-leaning-candidate-alexander-van-der-n691731 6])

Arguments for inclusion: 
:1) It is the literal translation 2) The English language websites of government ministries use the prefix (examples: [https://www.bundeskanzleramt.gv.at/en.html 1] [https://www.bundespraesident.at/en/index 2] [https://www.bmf.gv.at/en%20 3] [https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/ 4] [https://www.bundesheer.at/english/minister/cv_tanner.shtml 5])

Which color scheme is more accessible?

The current colors have been used across weather for the past decade. I believe these colors are hard to distinguish between on track maps for the dots, particularly between the Category 1-4 range. There simply isn't enough contrast between the colors to tell them apart (C1 and C2, C2 and C3, C3 and C4). This has presented a challenge for me as a reader and editor with normal color vision and decent eyesight with glasses. This issue would be even worse for color-blind editors. On the grounds of [[WP:ACCESS]], I am proposing a change to the below SSHWS colors, which increase the contrast between the hurricane colors. To summarize these changes, the Tropical Depression color was lightened ever so slightly, the Tropical Storm and Category 1 colors were left untouched, Category 2 was darkened, the current Category 4 and 5 colors were moved down to 3 and 4, respectively, and a new purple color was introduced to fill the empty Category 5 spot. These changes would apply to track maps and infoboxes for weather articles. I would also propose adjusting the colors used for the infoboxes for other scales to match the changes being proposed here for SSHWS so we maintain a mostly-uniform color scale for the different tropical cyclone and weather scales. Below are tables of the old colors and proposed changes. I have also included a side-by-side comparison between the two color schemes for [[Hurricane Ivan]]'s track.

Keeping in mind the fact that the Bangladesh Liberation War took place on the Eastern front, do you support:

*'''Option 1''': Include only the strength on the Eastern Front for both sides
*'''Option 2''': Include the total strength across all fronts for both sides
*'''Option 3''': Include the total strength of one side, but only the strength on one front for the other (as the article currently does)

At this point, [[Portal:Current events/April 1994]] has been deleted. If that has been deleted, then we might as well delete the pages for all the other months in 1994 too. So, we need an RfC.

Which year (from 1994 to 2006) should be the cut-off point for the monthly subpages? The current status quo is 1994. If there is consensus not to have monthly subpages for any month in a particular year yyyy or earlier, then all the following pages and their talk pages should be deleted:
*The following for all twelve months from January to December in years yyyy and earlier:
**[[Portal:Current events/Month Year]]
**[[Portal:Current events/Month Year/Calendar]]
**[[Portal:Current events/Month Year/Sidebar]]
*[[Portal:Current events/Year Month Day]] for all the days in years yyyy and earlier
*[[:Category:Year by day]] for years yyyy and earlier

This only affects the [[Portal:Current events]] subpages. Users may still recreate an article at [[Month Year]] with detailed references that follows the format used at [[December 1993]] and earlier months. These mainspace pages do not follow the same format as the [[Portal:Current events]] subpages.

These views have been criticised as [[Transphobia|transphobic]] by [[LGBT rights]] organisations and some [[Feminism|feminists]], but have received support from some other feminists and individuals.
:'''B:''' Since 2019, Rowling has received significant attention for her views on [[Politics_of_J._K._Rowling#Transgender_people|transgender people and related civil rights]]. These views have been widely criticized as [[transphobia|transphobic]] in mainstream media and mainstream [[feminism]], yet has received support from [[TERF|trans-exclusionary radical feminists]], some artists, and a few [[Conservative politics|conservative politicians]].
:'''C:''' Since 2019, coverage of Rowling's views on [[Politics_of_J._K._Rowling#Transgender_people|transgender people and related civil rights]] has gained increasing prominence in the media. Her views, published on social media and her personal website, have been widely criticized as [[transphobia|transphobic]] in mainstream media and mainstream [[feminism]], yet have received support from [[TERF|trans-exclusionary radical feminists]], some artists, and a few [[Conservative politics|conservative politicians]].
:'''D:''' Leave it out of the lead completely.
:'''E:''' Include in the lead section, with other language to be determined later.
:'''F:''' Other. Please propose an alternative if you do vote this option.

As somebody who has written on many subjects outside the English-speaking world but who lives in the English-speaking world, I see many websites like the Teller Report in my search results. These websites Google Translate major news websites from the rest of the world. The articles are 1) often incomprehensible and 2) violate copyright. Teller Report is cited on many pages: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&limit=500&offset=0&profile=default&search=tellerreport.com&ns0=1]. It is my opinion that there is no room for negotiation here: this site must be blacklisted for 1) copyright violation and 2) not being written or edited by humans. I found on [[Ralf Rangnick]] that a Teller Report page [https://www.tellerreport.com/news/2019-07-10---ralf-rangnick--%22i-am-one-of-the-greatest-romantics%22-.ryMCpV7bS.html had been removed on request] from the German newspaper Zeit. For those unfamiliar with the Teller Report's content and quality, here is a story from today which even copied the image from RT: [https://www.tellerreport.com/news/2021-12-28-zhirinovsky-proposed-to-increase-the-holidays-of-russians-at-the-expense-of-holidays.rJfNOkG_oK.html "Zhirinovsky proposed to '''increase the holidays''' of Russians '''at the expense of holidays'''"] [[User:Unknown Temptation|Unknown Temptation]] ([[User talk:Unknown Temptation|talk]]) 20:16, 28 December 2021 (UTC)}}

Common Sense Media is a San Francisco-based non-profit organization that provides education and advocacy to families to promote safe technology and media for children. It reviews entertainment in terms of age-appropriate educational content, and it has also developed a set of ratings that are intended to gauge the educational value of videos, games, and apps.

But I think [[Common Sense Media]] is unreliable for the following reasons. I used rottenwebsites.miraheze.org/wiki/Common_Sense_Media which has a page on the wiki.
#They are too gullible about lessons, believing that every media influences children. For example, on their [[Teen Titans Go!]] review they gave it a 3/5 in teaching positive messages, and they gave [[13 Reasons Why]] a 4/5 due to the show supporting suicide.
#As an advocate for education, they pander towards educational shows and they are biased against shows that entertain, such as Spongebob SquarePants.
#They pander towards [[social justice warriors]], meaning the source is ideologically biased and they pander towards media supporting their ideology. For example, they entirely neglect content containing sexual violence against men.[[User:Bsslover371|Bsslover371]] ([[User talk:Bsslover371|talk]]) 01:27, 28 December 2021 (UTC)}}

# Luaficate its wikitext structure to lower the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=Chembox&namespace=10 vast number of its subpages];

Are the following paragraphs sourced to John Robson, considerable as {{tq|criticism of Sikhism}} and more particularly, {{tq|Sikh practice of biblolatry}}?
{{talkquote|Govind Singh at his death did not appoint any guru to succeed him, but told them to look to the ''Granth'', to which he had added a supplement, as their guru. This has led to what is the most marked feature of the Sikh religion — Bibliolatry. ''Sri Granth'', the honourable Book, is the object of worship in all Sikh temples. It is dressed in expensive cloth, laid carefully in its bed at night, like one of the Hindu idols, and when brought out, receives divine worship before it is read. Next to the ''Granth'' the ''Guru'' or master is honoured, and he has great power over his disciples. In doctrine they are not very different from the Vaishnavas; in morality, except in soldierly virtues, they are said to be even below the average Hindus. They are divided into twelve sects, some of which are relapsing into image worship, and in process of time it is not unlikely that they will all take their place in the ranks of all-absorbing Hinduism.{{pb}}Meanwhile Sikhism may fairly claim to be a distinct religion; and it is remarkable as being the only eclectic creed which has ever become the religion of a large body of disciples, and welded them into a nation. Even it proves the rule. It is not its eclectic creed which gives Sikhism its power over its followers, but the sectarian and patriotic dogmas inculcated by Govind. These gave it power so long as the power of fighting and of conquest remained. But now that it is lost, and it has only its eclecticism and bibliolatry to fall back on, it seems to have lost its expansiveness, and is increasing only with the increase of the population.|source={{Cite book|last=Robson|first=John|url=http://archive.org/details/hinduismandchri00unkngoog|title=Hinduism and Christianity|publisher=Oxford University|p=158-159|year=1905}}}} [[User:TrangaBellam|TrangaBellam]] ([[User talk:TrangaBellam|talk]]) 14:50, 1 December 2021 (UTC)}}

This article by user {{u|BunnyyHop}} has text that reads mostly straight out of an ML manifesto or an argumentative essay. It at one "The exploitation of man and nature are also linked at the level of consciousness. The mystification of wages forms a basis for the [[Trinitarian formula]]. One aspect of this formula is that man perceives the soil in a mystified way. It appears as if the soil is an independent source of value" followed by: ''"Exploitation of man and exploitation of nature go hand in hand. Thus Marx states in the first volume of Capital that every advance in capitalist agriculture is 'not only an advance in the art of robbing the worker, but at the same time in the art of robbing the soil, every advance in increasing its fertility for a given period of time is at the same time an advance in ruining the permanent sources of this fertility. [...] Capitalist production develops [...] only the technique and combination of the social process of production, undermining at the same time the springing sources of all wealth: the soil and the worker."''

These templates are presently documented as intended for use a) on cross-namespace redirects (e.g. {{tlx|R to project namespace}} goes on [[MOS:CAPS]], a shortcut in a "MOS:" pseudo-namespace that is really a mainspace page); and b) on within-same-namespace redirects (e.g., put that same {{tnull|R to project namespace}} on [[WP:MOSCAPS]], which is already in the same "Wikipedia:" namespace as the target page of the both WP:MOSCAPS and MOS:CAPS).

Presently the documentation on whether to do this is inconsistent.  {{tlx|R to main namespace}}, {{tlx|R to template namespace}}, {{tlx|R to user namespace}}, {{tlx|R to category namespace}}, and {{tlx|R to draft namespace}} are only for cross-namespace redirects.  {{tlx|R to talk page}} is a variant of this, in being for redirects to any talk namespace from any non-talk namespace, but not for redirects within a talk namespace or between one talk namespace and another.  Only {{tlx|R to project namespace}}, {{tlx|R to portal namespace}}, and {{tlx|R to help namespace}} say to use them also for redirects within the same namespace.

'''Which of the following is preferable?'''
# Apply such templates only to cross-namespace redirects.
# Apply such templates also to same-namespace redirects.
# Different for different cases (please specify, with rationales).

I'm RfCing this because there has been sporadic argument about this for several years, without resolution. Notices about this RfC have been posted to all the relevant talk pages I could think of. <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''']] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] 😼 </span> 19:07, 24 December 2020 (UTC)}}

If my experience is anything to go by, most reverts do not follow the guidelines on this page. I've been reverted without inadequate explanation or no explanation at all. When I make changes, designed to make the text clear or less misleading, I might be reverted by somebody who likes the old version better. I've even been reverted for failing to provide a citation.

I do realize that this page is an essay, not policy. But it would still be helpful if reverters were forced to consider these ideas. In any case, reversion needs to be a lot less impulsive.

To accomplish this, I propose these software changes:

# Instead of simply telling editors that revert comments are required, refuse to accept reverts without one.
# Provide a message about limiting use of reverts, with links to [[WP:OWN]] and/or [[WP:RV]].
# Force the editor to acknowledge these issues by checking a box to indicate that they're sure that reversion, instead of editing or discussion, is the right thing to do. Admins would be exempt, to make their vandalism cleanup less onerous.

I think we should make criteria to make belligerents clearly. It is too difficult and vague, because it contains too much information in one template.

We don't have to add all belligerents. I also do not prefer describing some specific belligerents such as Soviet Union in [[Invasion of Poland]] whose statue as Axis was controversial at 1939 to 1941, or Finland which describes as co-belligerent which is contradict to other articles.

Two separated points I'd like to highlight here. First, authoritarianism is being removed from the infobox without reason despite being supported by multiple citations and there is no consensus not to include it in the infobox.

On the second, separate point, we should not include only one of the two cited political positions in the infobox in the lead. Both right-wing and far-right are cited with multiple citations in the infobox. Either we include both of the cited positions in the lead or neither. To only include one position in the lead gives unnecessary weight to one position over the other.

CCTV is a distinctly depreciated source, as the community decided per a RfC Archive 312 in September 2020 [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_312#RFC:_China_Global_Television_Network here].

Exceptional claims via CCTV were deleted in good faith [diff] then readded. Inline citations to CCTV were then added in good faith [diff], per policy on adding contentious information on living persons. Those were reverted [diff] and characterized as "disruptive" [diff].

At issue is the exceptional CCTV claims (read ridiculous) were used in RS during the 2008 Tibetan uprising anniversary, or in the 'heat of the moment'.

This is a RfC on requiring inline citation of CCTV in such instances. If in these instances the depreciated status of CCTV allows for the deletion of edits sourcing CCTV indirectly, clarification is welcome.

There is a dispute regarding the classification of Due Weight view in this article. This situation is quite unusual, because traditionaly it would be just 2 clear views: skeptics vs ufologists, and perhaps government denial

I categorizes the current views as 4:

View #1: U.S. Department of Defence - The UFO, after their investigation is officially classified as "unidentified".

View #2: UFO Skeptics - it is for sure, not "unidentified". Listing different mundane explanations.

View #3: UFO advocates - it is probable that it is of extraterrestrial origin. Listing different mundane observations analysis.

View #4 Inconclusive without more info - a call of both skeptics and Ufologists alike from the DOD to release all information for scientific critical inspection in order to reach a conclusion.


All 4 views are available from reliable sources (many times even the same source), so that is not an issue.

My view is that the DOD view is Prime, and should not be marginalized or create a misrepresentation of it's weight by either views #2 & #3. Currently the article section "possible explanations" is inappropriatly giving due weight to view #2 (via long quotations from skeptic Mick West) which contradicts and marginalize view #1. View #3 is not presented according to [[WP:FRINGE]].

This reverted edit, corrects the current article  per above
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pentagon_UFO_videos&oldid=998819223

See also talk section "List of sources we could use" for detailed discussion regarding DOD position https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pentagon_UFO_videos#List_of_sources_we_could_use

Currently the article is mostly edited and debated in the talk page by the same UFO Skeptics, who are pushing for view #2.
Hence a call for an RfC to uninvolved editors.
Do you agree with the above assessment and categorization? [[User:Bigbaby23|Bigbaby23]] ([[User talk:Bigbaby23|talk]]) 09:22, 7 January 2021 (UTC)}}
