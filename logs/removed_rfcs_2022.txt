Should the line {{tq|The scope of this guideline covers all groups of people organized together for a purpose with the exception of non-profit educational institutions, religions or sects, and sports teams.}} be altered to state:
*'''A''': That esports are within the scope of this notability guideline
*'''B''': That esports are not within the scope of this notability guideline

This RfC is proposed in the context of the no consensus [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Stalwart Esports (2nd nomination)|Stalwart Esports AfD]] where the closer opined that there was a "real need" for guidance on which guideline or policy was controlling.

The infobox type has {{Diff2|1053292414|recently}} been changed to "Infobox character", with [[User:tgeorgescu|Tgeorgescu]] reasoning that this is the right infobox to use for fictional characters, such as biblical patriarchs. The effect of the change is that some fields are hidden from view, a change in layout and that a banner saying "In-universe information" appears. The undersigned argues that the infobox should be chosen pragmatically, that the hidden fields are relevant and that the "in-universe information"-banner is slightly jarring outside the context of modern fiction.

A similar change has recently been made for other biblical characters: {{Diff2|1057903602|here}}, {{Diff2|1053292117|here}}, {{Diff2|1053292022|here}}, {{Diff2|1053292893|here}}, {{Diff2|1053292662|here}} and {{Diff2|1058237890|here}}.

This request for comment covers three distinct unresolved questions relating to [[List of presidents of the United States]] and [[List of vice presidents of the United States]]:

# Should the lists be sortable? ([[#1: Sortability|section]])
# Should the lists' headers contain [[wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility/Data tables tutorial#Overview of basics|scope]] metadata? ([[#2: Scope metadata|section]])
# How should the columns be ordered? ([[#3: Column order|section]])

A brief summary of related edits to the list of presidents from 21 October to 17 November, which led to discussion and this RfC, can be found [[Special:PermaLink/1055809556#c-Tol-2021-11-17T23:04:00.000Z-Thewolfchild-2021-11-17T22:22:00.000Z|here]].

{{rfcquote|text=
The newer source in the article seems to refute the older one regarding the existence of shields with the Lambda symbol on them (Relevant excerpts from both https://imgur.com/a/kjDy64C). 
Both seem to be more PopHist rather than academic, so I believe there is reason to collect an overview of recent scholarship and establish a consensus on whether the use of the symbol should be included in the article.

The reason why this is an RfC relates to the widespread use of the symbol on a shield across Wikipedia. The "Spartan Constitution" Template as well as the [[Sparta]] main article use a [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sparta_shield.svg drawing] of the supposed shield as illustrations, which seems to be inspired by the old movie [[The 300 Spartans]]. All of which should probably be replaced if there is no real evidence for the historicity of the design (maybe by a spartan helmet?). In recent years the particular shield design popularized by the 2007 version of ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' also became the logo of the [[Identitarian movement]], which received media attention at the time,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Sparta Fetish Is a Cultural Cancer |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/154563/sparta-myth-rise-fascism-trumpism}}</ref> where it is treated more like a popular misconception, while on Wikipedia it is essentially stated as fact.

User generated news site, seems to be quite new, and has so far [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=insource%3A%22twnews.co.uk%22&title=Special:Search&profile=advanced&fulltext=1&ns0=1&ns1=1&ns2=1&ns3=1&ns14=1&ns15=1&ns118=1&ns119=1 only been used a handful of times]. Mostly local news in the UK at the moment like complaints about roadworks, dogs up for adoption and such. However there are obvious issues that anyone can just "create" a reliable source there. The [[Adrian Câciu]] (a Romanian politician) article is one BLP article that uses it as a source. This might be a bit of a premature rfc, and one with a forgone conclusion but I think that it's better to deal with it explicitly now than wait until it becomes a problem later.

Is it:
# Generally reliable for factual reporting
# Unclear or additional considerations apply
# Generally unreliable for factual reporting (and therefore ruled out for BLP articles)
# Publishes false or fabricated information, and should be deprecated

This dispute has also carried over to the [[2021 MLS season]] page. [[User:Jay eyem|Jay eyem]] ([[User talk:Jay eyem|talk]]) 05:06, 15 December 2021 (UTC)}}

Proposal to remove the historical ideologies, political positions and national affiliations from the infobox as it makes it far too cluttered and difficult for people to easily read and navigate. This information and the corresponding citations should definitely still be included on the page, just incorporated into the main text with the corresponding citations rather than being placed in the infobox. The infobox can then be kept to what can be cited as the party's current ideologies, current political position and current national affiliation. I'd be more confident if the historical information could be incorporated into the main body by another editor who can read French and/or has more knowledge of the party than myself though.

Currently, there is a dispute on article [[Battle of Peshawar (1758)]] where the user keeps adding unreliable sources. So I would like to have a Yes or No vote from all editors whether the source is reliable or not according to your opinion. These sources are:
'''Book: Chhatrapati Shivaji The Maratha Warrior and His Campaign By Jeneet Sorokhaibam · 2013'''<br>and<br>'''Book: Third Battle of Panipat by Abhas Verma ISBN 9788180903397 Bharatiya Kala Prakashan'''

Article [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Potentially_unreliable_sources/Books_that_plagiarize_Wikipedia], under section "Others" shows that author Jeneet Sorokhaibam is not reliable. This is what it says:

''Chhatrapati Shivaji: The Maratha Warrior and His Campaign by Jeneet Sorokhaibam (Vij Books, 2013)For example, see page 139: "Afzal Khan felt that the ensuing battle..." Copied from the 2012 version of the Wikipedia article on Afzal Khan (general).''

Also author Abhas Verma is not reliable as he has no professional expertise in the historical academic area and is actually an IT professional working for a company in Bangalore, India. He stated that he is writer by choice. Also the writer is a regular user on quora as well and a blogger. Here is his profile, [https://trunicle.com/author/abhas/]. Also this user's/author's account was banned on quora [https://www.quora.com/profile/Abhas-Verma] but rejoined with a new account [https://www.quora.com/profile/Abhas-Verma-9?q=abhas%20verma]. 

Please provide your opinion(s) with Yes or No on the reliability, so that the dispute about the above references can be resolved? [[User:MehmoodS|MehmoodS]] ([[User talk:MehmoodS|talk]]) 23:32, 13 January 2022 (UTC)}}

As {{reply to|SMcCandlish}} said, a set of RfCs to make certain changes to the lead might be the best approach to avoid edit wars and such. However, since some of these changes are very small and minor, I'm instead putting them in a singular RfC, but where you can support or oppose certain changes. ("Support all", "Support A/B but Oppose C", "Oppose all") I'm hoping this won't run too long (maximum of 2 weeks maybe?) given that these changes don't seem too contentious in general.

{{rfcquote|text=
I think that the page [[Poaceae]] and [[Grass]] should be separated. This was merged by [[User:Plantsurfer]] in a small vote of 4 to 1 on 26 February 2016. The reasons are below:
# 5 votes is not enough for such a fundamental page. The voting process should have been much larger, and opened up to the greater public for more comments and arguments.
# I think the concept "grass" is much more ubiquitous that Poaceae, and has many more uses beyond just the scientific. Poaceae should refer to just the scientific classification, and grass to the non-scientific group. They have some overlap, but are also very distinct.
# I started the move request above, and the reality is that Poaceae and grasses are not synonymous or exactly equivalent. Grasses tends to refer to certain strains, some of which "(rushes, sedges)" are not in Poaceae at all, so you can say that grass is a non-diffusing category.
At worst, there should be a DAB page at the base name, although I contend grass should probably have a page for itself. I don't think it makes sense for the more popular and universally used concept of grass to have been the merged into the more specific poaceae.--[[User:Ortizesp|Ortizesp]] ([[User talk:Ortizesp|talk]]) 22:05, 17 January 2022 (UTC)}}

Is the style of the current "Uses" section detrimental to covering the topic in an encyclopedic manner?

'''Survey'''

*'''Yes, as starter''' — I believe that the current uses section reads like a list of news items/headlines rather than a comprehensive analysis of how NFTs are used. Additionally, as all criticism is left for the "Issues and criticisms" section at the bottom of the article rather than throughout the article, it means that readers that come across the section are not given a concise understanding of how NFTs are used.{{pb}}Additionally, having separate subsections for things like games and media does not make much sense to me as, from my understanding, there is not much difference in what the NFTs of these mediums are (a certificate of authenticity/ownership and not the work itself).

This request for comment pertains to the deletion, on spurious or quibbling grounds, by two other users, of a contribution to the page entitled "God" by the undersigned.

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=God&type=revision&diff=1067723405&oldid=1067722697

There is possibly no more contentious and politically fraught subject in the history of the sociology of humanity than the notion of "God". For milennia, the concept of God has been the cause-celebre of wars, genocides, and every imaginable abuse of human rights, so Wikipedia bears a heavy responsibility to ensure it does not allow itself to be abused by propagandists censoring scientific archaeological and historical political objectivity.

That heavy responsibility must not be taken lightly and allow technical argument to blockade an objective and verifiable scientific fact: the fact that human cultures around the world had notions of the concept of God (even of a single omnipotent God) long before the Christian Bible was written.

My [deleted] contribution identifies that fact as a linear thread that runs throughout prehistory and history, citing sources which cite other sources, providing objectively verifiable evidence for the existence of that thread, which (somewhat astonishingly) is so simple and clear that it can be written on a single A4 page!

I think it would be valuable re-evaluate the need to dismiss one aspect of population data included on the lead paragraph for several reasons :
# The data is too old, when newer data is available
# Other UK cities lead paragraphs use population data that takes into account the conurbation and not just the immediate city centre population  
# There is more than 6 different population stats to choose from when measuring the size of the city, so why choose this particular data set without a thorough discussion of the other available data given by the ONS?
# Consensus was not achieved in previous edit disputes and unilateral action was taken. 
# There is evidence from the Birmingham article talk page that there is a minor edit war between Manchester and Birmingham articles and thus some editors maybe pandering to a covert bias by choosing certain population data over others for advantatious reasons.

*The July mid-year critics lists on the body: the article features the following lists: {{tq|"[the song] appeared on the mid-year "Best Hip Hop Songs of 2021 (So Far) critics list by HipHopDX.[228][229] Minaj's verse on "Fractions" from Beam Me Up Scotty appeared on the mid-year "Best Rap Verses of 2021 So Far" critics list from Complex.[230]}}. These lists published in July do not hold weight compared to the actual year-end lists, posting them is just fillers. while there isn't an specific policy to remove mid-year lists, it is just an indiscriminate collection of information.

There has been much discussion about pre-print repositories, such as [[bioRxiv]], here at RSN. Several times, people have come here asking if they are reliable sources, and in each instance, most people seem to agree that they are not: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_304#bioRxiv_%28discussion_on_RS_for_haplogroups%29 Example 1] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Is_a_preprint_quoted_in_an_article_by_someone_not_a_DNA_specialist_ok_as_a_source_for_DNA? 2]

Despite the widespread acknowledgement among elite editors that we should rely on peer-reviewed secondary sources, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Biorxiv&title=Special:Search&profile=advanced&fulltext=1&ns0=1 citations of bioRxiv content remain hugely popular,] particularly at articles relating to human ethnicity or human genetic origins. Most of these articles are patrolled by smart people, who simply aren't noticing the problem. 

By no means is it my intention to single out bioRxiv. I have nothing against them or their mission, and there are definitely other pre-print repositories just like them which are also cited on Wikipedia. Websites like preprints.org, thesiscommons, peerj.com, and the osf.io repository should be considered here as well. 

The only point I am trying to make is that these types of sources evidently fail WP:RS, yet are widespread on Wikipedia. It looks to me like deprecation is a viable solution, so I'd like to hear all of your thoughts. [[User:Hunan201p|Hunan201p]] ([[User talk:Hunan201p|talk]]) 01:52, 29 January 2022 (UTC)}}

Srivastava Group is a holding company registered in India which was found to be operating a disinformation network with at least 265 identified fake news websites.

As the article Nicki Minaj has added the sentence "[She] has been referred to as the 'Queen of Rap'" to its lead section, I was reading some of the reasoning on [[Talk:Justin_Bieber/Archive_7#Request_for_comment|Bieber's 'Prince of Pop' discussion]], and there's a point on these mentioned nicknames not being exclusive, not essential to just one person, and actually being passed around. And newer artists have already started to get the nickname within the press.

Aside from the mentioned, there's two other articles that have the nickname "Queen of Rap" on their lead sections:
*Queen Latifah
*[[Missy Elliott]]
Both widely covered

{{small|(Also [[Lil' Kim]] and [[MC Lyte]] have the same nickname within their articles)}}

Seeking uniformity and integration in Wikipedia, I'm proposing their lead (of the three) go from

*[Name] has been referred to as "the Queen of Rap" by several media outlets
to
*[Name] is among the women that have been cited as the "Queen of Rap" by multiple media outlets.

I am requesting a comment on a deleted draft of [[User:Rhhslv|User:Rhhslv's]] [[User:Rhhslv/sandbox|sandbox]] for a new draft article on holistic scoring due to [[Wikipedia:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion#U5|U5: Misuse of Wikipedia as a webhost]]. The article was deleted due to one citation Dr. [[User:Rhhslv|Richard H. Haswell]] used of his own work. 

How does this go against [[WP:SELFPUB]] and [[WP:SELFCITE]]? Specifically, self-citation is allowed on Wikipedia only when "produced by an established subject matter expert, whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable, independent publications" and the article "should not place undue emphasis on your work" (WP:SELFPUB, WP:SELFCITE). Would one citation of his work be considered self-promotion on a topic that he has widely published on by reliable publications and the work itself is critical to a comprehensive understanding of the topic? The article contributed to a more complete understanding of [[Holistic grading]] and contributes to the efforts of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Writing|WikiProject Writing]]. 

See talk page discussion on [[User_talk:Bbb23/Archive_55#blocking%20of%20an%20uncompleted%20draft%20of%20a%20new%20arictle|User:Bbb23's talk page]] for our prior discussion on the issue. We are requesting comment now to receive greater response and concensus on the issue.

Should the article subject be changed from Nestorian to Assyrian? I explained my reasoning on the talk page; 

the main source used in this article "The Emergence of Kurdish Nationalism and the Sheikh Said Rebellion, 1880–1925" states the people were Assyrian. "One of these was the Assyrian (Nestorian) rebellion of 3-4 September 1924 of Beyt Sebab, which, as indicated above, was itself very much related to the Sheikh Said rebellion." Nestorian is a theology of Christianity that is incorrect and does not apply to Assyrians and was incorrectly used sometimes to describe them. The Assyrian people page explains this as well: [[Assyrian_people]]

 I tried to edit this article by inserting Latisha’s correct and chosen name along with her correct pronouns. There has been other editors trying to correct the issue as well as early as 2017. The constant misgendering and use of Latisha’s deadname is blatantly disrespectful and transphobic. It saddens me how the deceased are still disrespected and told who they are. It’s distasteful, for the community and shows that even in death, trans men and women can’t even die as they wished to live. I would love to hear others respective thoughts on this.

Vision Therapy is an umbrella term for many practices, some of them fraudulent, but many of them - based on my own and several family-members' experiences - ''not'' fraudulent. Going by the rest of the talk page, I am far from the only one who's upset that this whole entire field of medicine is being framed as a pseudoscience - but the fact that most of the existing sources are sneerish handwringing about the efficacy studies which have been done, makes it hard to actually edit the thing.

The names of two buildings, the South Houses and North Houses, have been capitalized in this article since it was created in 2005.  There have recently been discussions and edits proposing that these terms should be lowercase.  The disagreement arises from whether these building names are proper nouns, and whether the sources using capitals constitute a "substantial majority".  

According to [[MOS:CAPS]], "In English, [[Proper noun|proper names]], which can be either single words or phrases, are typically capitalized," and "Wikipedia relies on sources to determine what is conventionally capitalized; only words and phrases that are consistently capitalized in a substantial majority of independent, reliable sources are capitalized in Wikipedia."  This RfC applies to this article as well as the related articles [[History of the Caltech house system]], [[Campus of the California Institute of Technology]], and [[California Institute of Technology]].

Should Daily NK ([https://www.dailynk.com/english/ website link]) be considered an unreliable source? I noticed that Daily NK is used a lot in the article [[COVID-19 pandemic in North Korea]], and noticed that it seemed to somewhat contradict the World Health Organization about Covid-19 in North Korea during April 2020, not a complete contradiction, but Daily NK reported a positive case from a dead North Korean defector, while a WHO representative reported 100% negative cases. Additionally, I could not find any other sources that confirmed North Korea is lying about cases, implying that Daily NK has not been able to show definitive evidence of anything.

Doing some more research into Daily NK, I found this article that also points to the unreliability of Daily NK and it's influence on misinformation in the Western world: [https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2020/5/6/why-the-western-media-keeps-getting-north-korea-wrong Al Jazeera article].

Additionally, here are some Snopes articles, all which points to the unreliability of Daily NK: [https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/04/25/kim-jong-un-near-death/ Heart surgery], [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/north-korea-ban-skinny-jeans/ Skinny jeans], [https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/04/10/north-korea-insists-it-has-no-coronavirus/ Coronavirus]

While it appears that Daily NK is not often being debunked, it appears that there is also no reason to particularly trust them as a reliable source. They use anonymous sources without further fact-checking (though I haven't found anything about them using defectors in particular as sources). While the number of sources that questions its reliability/call it unreliable seem a good bit limited, I have not been able to find a single source that confirms it as reliable.

Am wondering if the website ''[[Next Avenue]]'' can be considered a reliable source for information within a BLP.  Article: [[Morrison Polkinghorne]], url of source is [https://www.nextavenue.org/cambodia-second-act-business/ here].  Appears to have an editorial staff, is published by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], and claims to adhere to the [https://www.pbs.org/standards/ PBS Standards and Practices] (which looks like it means this source qualifies as generally reliable).

Abolish the current version of [[WP:NSPORTS|NSPORTS]]. This page, far from being {{tq|rules of thumb which some editors choose to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to keep an article}}, does not help the decision process, but actively hampers it. Examples are countless of one group of editors (whether it be football, olympics, or plenty of others) arguing that an article should be kept because (correctly or not) its subject "passes N[some random sport]" or that "sportsperson from long time ago, there [[WP:MUSTBESOURCES]]"; and others correctly arguing that the existing coverage is not sufficient to write an encyclopedia article ([[WP:NOTDATABASE|as opposed to a database entry]]). This leads to needless conflict, pointless AfDs and DRVs, and above all bureaucratic waste of time. Abolishing this guideline and falling back directly to GNG would also help in reducing issues of [[WP:BIAS]] and the disproportionate amount of (usually white, male, European) sports figures that are included, as well as make policy more understandable to newer and more experienced editors alike by avoiding issues of [[WP:CREEP]].

Hi All,
I would like to expand this list with online encyclopedias that do not have  their own Wikipedia articles. I believe they are relevant to Wikipedia but don't necessarily need their own articles ([[List of 19th-century encyclopedias|other]] encyclopedia lists also have items without an article). I would use [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mix'n'match/Catalogues this list] compiled for Wikidata properties - plenty of important, academic encyclopedias. When I tried to start expanding the list, my edits were reverted by {{ping|MrOllie}}. See our discussion about this [[User_talk:MrOllie/Archive_15#List_of_online_encyclopedias|here]]. One of his concerns was that the list would be filled with fan wikis - this can be avoided easily that the list only includes non-open reference works. Anyway, could you chip in and tell if it's okay for me to expand the article? Thanks.

West's influence extends far beyond rap, and several current musical acts have publicly expressed that they were influenced by him, or have multiple media outlets saying that their music is influenced by West (eg - Billie Eillish, Frank Ocean etc). He has a lot of influence in hip hop, but also on mainstream pop, RNB and other genres. I think we should change 'one of the most influential rappers of all time' to 'one of the most influential musical artists of all time'.

If that sounds too grandiose, 'one of the most influential musical artists of the 21st century' is also appriopriate. [[Special:Contributions/59.93.255.148|59.93.255.148]] ([[User talk:59.93.255.148|talk]]) 19:30, 26 January 2022 (UTC)}}

# [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Billion&oldid=1070657022 Version 1], using bullet points to treat the definition on the two number scales equally and clearly.
# [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Billion&oldid=1070653570 Version 2], prioritising the modern-day definition in English speaking countries.

{{rfcquote|text=
An anonymous editor has twice removed the word "funeral march" from the description of the slow movement. He has justified this by saying that the tempo marking on the movement only mentions "marcia" and does not mention funeral. However, the form is unquestionably that of a [[Funeral March]] and not of, for example, a military march, and it is universally referred to in the literature as a funeral march. When I restored the term funeral march to the article, I added a reference, but the anonymous editor removed it again.
I do not want to edit war with this editor, so I am referring to the hive mind to adjudicate the matter. I will abstain from editing for a few days while responses gather here like bees to a honeypot.

All right. Since I haven't gotten much response from the second party to this content dispute, particularly some key points, and instead gotten accusations of canvassing, I'm inviting others here in a completely unselective manner, although said party is still welcome to find further verification for his or hers (or their) position. Anyway! On with it. The second party's edit (which had remained, according to them for over a year here before I reverted it today) had made the release date in the infobox to claim "February or March 1957" and same in the lead, with multiple sources cited together, one claiming the March release and the other two or three claiming February. I reduced it to one source after seeing enough sources that made it in my mind a majority claim. After a bit back and forth, much off-topic, here we are.

{{rfcquote|text=
A significant amount of Talk page discussion and reverting has focused on the question of whether or not to include a summary of the subsection of the article dealing with Controversies in the lead section. The RFC is to determine if consensus among editors is that article should or should not include a summary of the Controversies section in the lead section, and what form it should take if consensus is that some version of a summary of the Controversies section should be included in the lead section.

:Option (A): The lead section should not include a summary of the subsection on Controversies in the lead section, since the article is ostensively about the sporting events taking place at the Olympics.

:Option (B): Include a neutral version of a summary of the subsection on Controversies which does not single out any of the nearly two dozen Controversies currently listed in the subsection on Controversies.

:Option (C): Include a version of the summary of the subsection on Controversies which lists the human rights issues and Ugyur controversies as examples of the many Controversies currently taking place at the Winter Olympics.

:Option (D): Other options. 

Editors are requested to await the conclusion of the RFC before adding further edits about Controversies into the lead section. [[User:ErnestKrause|ErnestKrause]] ([[User talk:ErnestKrause|talk]]) 17:07, 7 February 2022 (UTC)}}

Should the political status of the territory of Taiwan as a province of China, which is the ROC's, PRC's, and US's official position, and as far as I know not questioned by any other state, be mentioned in the lede, perhaps in the first paragraph, and described in the article (It is currently not described as a province anywhere in this article)? ( In the Joint Communique, the United States recognized the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35855.htm )  There are currently 2 articles [[Taiwan Province]] and [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China]], should they be linked to from this article?  There was a previous RFC [[RFC Talk:Taiwan/Archive_30#RfC:_Taiwan,_"country"_or_"state"]] which did not address this issue, but for some reason there is an info box on this page banning reference to Taiwan as a province based on that RFC.

{{rfcquote|text=
Which color scheme is more accessible?

The current colors have been used across weather for the past decade. I believe these colors are hard to distinguish between on track maps for the dots, particularly between the Category 1-4 range. There simply isn't enough contrast between the colors to tell them apart (C1 and C2, C2 and C3, C3 and C4). This has presented a challenge for me as a reader and editor with normal color vision and decent eyesight with glasses. I have to open the full resolution to tell the difference between the colors and even then it can be a challenge for some. This issue would be even worse for color-blind editors. On the grounds of [[WP:ACCESS]], I am proposing a change to the below SSHWS colors, which increase the contrast between the hurricane colors. Please place comments in the formal discussion section below.

{{rfcquote|text=
I screwed up and erroneously contested a reasonable CSD over the redirect [[Mike Hart (outfieldr, born 1951)]], instead causing it to be sent to RFD, wasting other editors' time. I did this because R3 contains the phrase "Implausible typo", which leads to the idea that plausible typos (such as forgetting a letter, as was the case in the CSD I contested) should be kept, or at least sent to RFD. After {{User|Tamzin}} told me about what I did wrong, I cast my non-vote as '''Delete''' and then proceeded to type this up.

Overall, the word "Typo" in R3 implies that redirects that are '''NOT''' plausible, intentional search terms, but are still likely to be accidentally typed, should be kept. This is not the case, and as such, I think we should remove the term "Typo" from the page. This both reduces confusion ''and'' sets a clear precedent for dealing with such redirects, as they are now "Implausible Misnomers" and can therefore be deleted.

Wikipedia's interests in increasing the visibility of both disabilities and LGBTQ+ identities while diminishing the possibility of demeaning or hurtful presentations of these minorities sometimes may cause tension that is difficult to resolve. Issues arising in this area must be addressed with a high sensitivity to the competing concerns and editors must remain civil and continue to assume good faith from others in the discussion. This RfC is an effort to address such an issue on this page. A previous discussion happened above in [[Talk:List_of_fictional_characters_with_disabilities#Sexual_orientation_and_disabled_characters|this section]], but an involved editor disputed the consensus from this discussion based on how few editors were involved. Thus,  I have started this RfC to gain more involvement as low participation is a valid concern.
# The list should not include this information and limit itself just to describing the disability of the character(s); (Table 1)
# Add an additional column to the list titled "Character Notes" to include this information and other character descriptors that readers might find interesting or relate to, keeping the disability information in a "Disabilities" column; (Table 2)
# The list should include this information in the "Notes" section (status quo) (Table 3)

My suggestion is to also deprecate Baidu Tieba, or even we should add it to spam blacklist due to mass user-generated contents, mass copy-paste of copyvio contents and mass release of republic of fake news.

{{rfcquote|text=
I suggest to split the article into two articles: "Military academies in Russia" and "Military schools and institutions in Russia" on the basis of the following justification:
* Higher military schools and military institutions prepare career commissioned officers for active duty service as platoon/company commanders and at equivalent positions (tactical level). It is the first level of higher military education. Any citizen who graduated from secondary school can entry military school or institution.
* Military academies improve skills of commissioned officers to allow them to be appointed to battalion/regiment/brigade commander or equivalent positions (operational-tactical level). It is the second level of higher military education. Officer can entry military academy only after several years of active duty service as commissioned officer. In addition, there is [[Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia]], which is the third level of higher military education. (strategic level).

I think it would be better to avoid the mixing of military educational institutions accessible to all citizens without officer's rank for enrolment and military educational institutions accessible to career commissioned officers only.

Also, I'm totally against the inclusion in the article's text of  Suvorov, Nakhimov and similar schools. These schools don't prepare military personnel at all. These schools are usual secondary schools, just with a military focus, which graduates can choose either military or civilian way of life. So, we need a separate article for these schools.

What evidence do we have of the reliability of Századvég as a pollster? Do they fairly poll respondents across a broad range of all ages and demographics, weight age and sex of respondents etc and ask questions in a neutral manner? For example, if the questions were worded exactly how they are set to be in the proposed changes set out in the referendum, then there could be accusations levelled against their neutrality and wording. Do they have any links to the Hungarian government? I think it is also important that we note how the questions in the poll were worded, the number of people polled and the demographics of those who were polled.

I was surprised to discover that we have [[:Category:Swiss footballers]] with a subcategory of [[:Category:Swiss women's footballers]] yesterday, since this seems to contradict [[Wikipedia:Categorization/Ethnicity, gender, religion and sexuality#Gender]], specifically "sportsperson categories should be split by gender, except in such cases where men and women participate primarily in mixed-gender competition". I think that we need to have "men's" subcategories to match "women's". It seems that this is a systematic problem with footballer categories, and the CfD at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2022 February 18#Category:Swiss footballers]] had a lot of procedural opposes since this needs a wider discussion. Hence this RfC - '''should we have "men's footballers" categories to match the "women's footballers" categories that already exist?''' Thanks.

Should the above colors for the maps also be adopted for infoboxes and other weather templates using the same scale? Should the timeline background color be changed for all weather articles?

It has been brought to my attention that the above RfC may not have been clear about the entire scope of the changes. Given that consensus was achieved above to remove links from infoboxes for colored regions, that contrast aspect is no longer an issue. However, two issues still remain. Some people have mentioned above that they want to keep consistency between the maps and the infoboxes as it could be confusing if there are differences between the two. Additionally, the color blindness issue still remains for those who use colors to tell apart different statuses as the same contrast issue between colors exists, especially when multiple statuses are in an infobox for different agencies. This proposal increases the contrast between colors in infoboxes and other templates which use the same scale to match the maps which were changed in the above RfC. I recently also discovered a serious breach of MOS:ACCESS on the timelines where the TS color blends in with the background for folks who possess a color blindness. Another header is added below to provide a change that in conjunction with the new colors will fix that issue as well.

Some content is under dispute, with me, @[[User:AllSaintsNext|AllSaintsNext]] and @[[User:80.6.178.12|80.6.178.12]] disagreeing on various sentences, as per discussions above. The proposed content has been slightly modified for readability and suggestions made above.

# Should the section "Issues of ethnicity" contain the following sentence, with a reference to the [https://www.rotherham.gov.uk/downloads/file/279/independent-inquiry-into-child-sexual-exploitation-in-rotherham Jay report], p. 147? {{diff|Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal||1064332964|Original removal diff}}
#:The inquiry's report stated that "agencies should acknowledge the suspected model of localised grooming of young white girls by men of Pakistani heritage, instead of being inhibited by the fear of affecting community relations."
# Should the section "''The Times'' investigation", subsection "Background" contain the following, with a reference to this [https://archive.fo/Dg2Cq 2014 Times article] (non-paywall link)?
#:Groups of men would flatter young girls in public places, offering them alcohol, cigarettes and lifts in fancy cars. One man would become the "boyfriend", and soon the girls were expected to have sex with the whole group, including contacts out of town. Norfolk writes that most sex offenders in the UK are white men and lone offenders; according to Norfolk, these cases were distinctive because most of the men had "Muslim names" and were working in groups.
# Should the section "''The Times'' investigation", subsection "Background" contain the following, with a reference to the same 2014 Times article?
#:The cases involved two or more men who had groomed young girls they had met on the street. Several cases resembled Rotherham, with girls being passed around groups. According to Norfolk, of the 56 perpetrators, 53 were Asian, with 50 of those having "Muslim names" and mostly Pakistani heritage - the other three were white.

There have been two sections now discussing Shane's status in WWE and whether or not we should say he was fired after the 2022 Royal Rumble. These discussions do not appear to have reached a consensus nor a conclusion, and there seems to be a bit of a stalemate. As this is a [[WP:BLP]] I think we should formalise this discussion as an RfC and reach a definitive conclusion.

* [[:Chicago Illinois Temple]] → {{no redirect|Chicago Mormon Temple}}

– There are at least 265 LDS temples listed at [[List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. They all use the same naming convention of <city> <state or country> Temple. They all fail [[WP:PRECISION]]. The titles need something to distinguish what kind of temple they are. See for example the disambiguation page [[Chicago temple]] and the various types of temples in that city. Each one has an unambiguous title, but the [[Chicago Illinois Temple]] seems to only lack disambiguation because someone chose to include the state in the title.

'''A''': Yes, there is a general consensus among reliable sources that the state flag of Alabama is based on the Confederate battle flag and therefore this should be included in the lead.

'''B''': No, there is disagreement over the origins of the state flag among reliable sources and therefore no mention of claimed Confederate (or Spanish, or other) origins or symbolism should be included in the lead

:'''(ii)''' although the fact that there is disagreement should be mentioned.

{{rfcquote|text=
This RFC affects the following articles: [[cattle]], [[aurochs]], [[taurine cattle]], [[zebu]], ''[[Bos]]''.

Currently, these articles show contradictory and inconsistant information about the taxonomy of cattle. This is due to the fact that the different types of cattle were recently re-established as separate species after previously being considered sub-species of a single species. Both taxonomies are contentious and neither is universally accepted by reliable sources. Wikipedia, however, needs to choose one or the other and implement it consistantly. Please indicate which taxonomy you believe Wikipedia should follow:

'''Taxonomy A'''<br>
According to MSW3, the taxonomy of cattle is:[http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/biology/resources/msw3/browse.asp?id=14200687]

*''Bos taurus'' (domestic cattle)
*''Bos taurus taurus'' (taurine cattle)
*''Bos taurus indicus'' (zebu)
*''Bos taurus primigenius'' (aurochs, the undomesticated ancestor)
In this case, the [[cattle]] article would correspond with the taxon ''Bos taurus''.

'''Taxonomy B'''<br>
According to Mammal Diversity Database, the taxonomy of cattle is:[https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxa.html]

*''Bos taurus'' (taurine cattle)
*''Bos indicus'' (zebu)
*''Bos primigenius'' (aurochs, the undomesticated ancestor)
In this case, the [[cattle]] article would correspond with the subgenus ''Bos'' (not to be confused with the genus ''[[Bos]]'').

<small>''This RFC does not affect the classication of Bison and does not serve as a referendum on the overall use of MDD or MSW3 on Wikipedia. It's scope is limited to domestic cattle and aurochs.''</small><br>

(RFC per [[Talk:Nicki_Minaj#Discussion|previous discussion]])

In the opening sentence of the lead section, it is claimed that the subject is known "{{tq|for her lyricism}}". However, not a single reliable source has stated that lyricism is what she is known for. Artists may stand out for their song lyrics (which is not the same as lyricism), but there isn't any important difference to push that here. Some sources may mention it as an ability, describing it with an adjective, or what a group of fans think, but others also mention is has been overshadowed by other aspects of her or her music.[https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/music/nicki-minaj-best-lyrics-verses-songs-features-queen-album-release-a3908781.html] It is a strong claim for an opening sentence that is only found in this Wiki; the word should be removed to avoid pushing minority pov and wp:synt. 

These are examples of sources stating someone is actually known for their lyricism:

*[https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/rapsody-says-jay-z-nfl-partnership-isnt-about-colin-kaepernick Complex] Rapsody is known for her lyricism..

There are two aspects of the article, Zefr and I cannot agree on:
* Scientific consensus suggests that the primary mode of action of flavan-3-ols is via improving vascular function - that is stated in reference 13. They should therefore be included in the text at least as prominent as the effect on blood lipids.
* Flavan-3-ols have been investigated in a large (n=20,000 subjects, 3.5 yr) clinical trial and shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular-diseases. While this is primary research, it is a large study that provides considerably more evidence for a potential health effect than all other cited evidence as it uses hard endpoints. I therefore belief it has sufficient relevance to be at least mentioned.

Can we get a consensus on the purpose and scope of this article? Is this article a list of
# All territories considered by another country to be "occupied" by Russia, or
# All territories considered by the United Nations and several UN countries to be ''militarily'' occupied by Russia?

The first sentence of this article is "Russian-occupied territories include ''the lands outside of Russia's internationally recognized borders which have been designated by the United Nations and most of the international community as under a Russian military occupation''." (emphasis mine) This wording implies the latter categorisation, but the [[Kuril Islands dispute]] between Russia and Japan does not fit that criteria (evidenced by the sources given), nor do the territorial disputes between Estonia and Russia as discussed above; they do, however, fit the former categorisation.

'''TL;DR:''' The purpose and scope of this article is unclear because some of the article's content contradicts the lead. In particular, the example of the Kuril Islands dispute between Russia and Japan contradicts the criteria set out in the first sentence of the article. '''Thus, should the content in this article meet the criteria outlined in 1. or 2.?'''

Should users without successful DYK Nominations be asked to judge other DYK Nominations?<br>
Until now, users who submitted DYK nominations were asked to judge a DYK Nomination '''if''' the nominator had 5 or more 'successful DYK Credits' (aka 'DYK credits' checked using [https://betacommand-dev.toolforge.org/cgi-bin/dyk.py this tool]). A proposal to change this rule was made on 4 April at [[#QPQ freebies]], where it was proposed that users with 5 or more DYK nominations (Successful or unsuccessful or pending) be asked to start judging DYK noms that others have filed. This RfC is to ratify [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADid_you_know&type=revision&diff=1081556143&oldid=1072019505&diffmode=source this change]. This proposal, if approved will demand users with 5 unsuccessful nominations, to start judging DYK nominations. Asking people with failed nominations to judge is a major change in [[WP:DYKRULES]] and deserves wider community consensus before implementation. 

'''Currently being followed''' 
:  Review requirement (QPQ) – For every nomination you make you must review one other nomination (unrelated to you){{mdashb}}this is called ''[[quid pro quo]]'' or QPQ. The review must address all five criteria listed here.<br />''Exception:'' If, at the time a nomination is promoted to the main page, its nominator has fewer than five <u>[[Wikipedia:List of Wikipedians by number of DYKs|DYK credits]]</u> (whether or not self-nominated) then the nominator is exempt from QPQ.

{{rfcquote|text=
Ferdinand Marcos is a controversial figure, recently there's been disagreement whether or not to use the term "kleptocrat" in the opening paragraph of this article, especially in a first-person tone. I find it disconcerting that other figures who can be compared to Marcos as similar such as Suharto has no mention of "kleptocrat" in any part of the article. Other figures in listed in the example section of the Kleptocracy wiki ([[Kleptocracy#Examples]]) has little or no mention of the term "kleptocrat" in their respective wikis as such I find this wiki odd. Another point I have raised is the term has become a pejorative in common parlance and I have discouraged its use when there are neutral alternatives of the term and I find its use in an encyclopedia unsuitable.

See section [[Talk:Ferdinand Marcos#Consistency with Wikipedia's use of the term "kleptocrat"]] for reference for the current discussion on the issue: Consistency with Wikipedia's use of the term "kleptocrat" [[User:Jay.zero21 9911|Jay.zero21 9911]] ([[User talk:Jay.zero21 9911|talk]]) 14:42, 15 March 2022 (UTC)}}

For example changing the population of the UK in this article, and replacing it with a "June 2021" figure coming from God knows where (the [[Office for National Statistics|ONS]] has not published mid-2021 population figures yet, they will do it only in September 2022), while not even bothering to change the source which still links to the mid-2020 population that this editor has now removed from the article and replaced with his "2021" figure: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population&diff=1079500922&oldid=1079434210].

Upon a cursory search of the archives, it seems that we [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Infobox_musical_artist/Archive_11#Spouse,_partner,_and_children_support last had an RfC about this matter exactly 10 years ago, by which time the parameters had been requested over 23 times.] The requests have not stopped since then, and I've failed to uncover any new extended discussion regarding the matter.

In the past week new documents concerning allegations of misused nonprofit funds have been published and reported by NY Mag, Snopes, Jezebel, The Independent, and other RS. Many other non-RS have picked up on this. The culprit, from the documents unearthed, is Mrs. Patrisse Cullors and she is being directly accused as the beneficiary of over $6 million dollar homes with misused BLM funds. After a request for protection on this page was granted, [[user:Slatersteven|Slatersteven]] and [[user:FDW777|FDW777]], two editors who collaborate together frequently as seen by visiting FDW777's talk page, have refused to add any of these RS sources. FDW777 going so far as accusing all these RS of orchestrating a smear campaign and only referring to year-old articles from these same sources to argue for non-inclusion. After requesting an outsider to take a look at this, Slatersteven directed me to the Admin's noticeboard and told me not to post anything there in what could be (mis)understood as a menacing tone.

{{rfcquote|text=
An ongoing discussion as to whether bolding the descriptive article title of tornado outbreaks and winter storms is compliant with [[MOS:BOLDTITLE]] and [[WP:SBE]] requires comment from others. As it stands now, tornado outbreak articles typically have the event type followed by the date while and winter storm articles have the date preceding the event type: [[Tornado outbreak and floods of April 28 – May 1, 2017]], [[Tornado outbreak of April 4–7, 2022]], [[January 14–17, 2022 North American winter storm]], or [[January 2022 North American blizzard]].
:Per WP:SBE, bolding these titles in the opening line "{{tq|gives undue weight to the chosen title, implying that it is an official term, commonly accepted name, or the only acceptable title; in actuality, it is just a description and the event or topic is given many different names in common usage.}}"
:Per MOS:BOLDTITLE, 
:{{tq|If an article's title is a formal or widely accepted name for the subject, display it in bold as early as possible in the first sentence.}}
:These titles are descriptive and not formal names.
:{{tq|Otherwise, include the title if it can be accommodated in a natural way.}}
:These titles require the whole sentence to be written around them, such as {{tq|The '''January 2022 North American blizzard''' was a powerful and disruptive [[blizzard]] that impacted the...}}. This would also fail MOS:BOLDTITLE.

Which color scheme is more accessible? Which color scheme balances accessibility and aesthetics?

The current colors have been used across weather for the past decade. I believe these colors are hard to distinguish between on track maps for the dots, particularly between the Category 1-4 range. There simply isn't enough contrast between the colors to tell them apart (C1 and C2, C2 and C3, C3 and C4). This has presented a challenge for me as a reader and editor with normal color vision and decent eyesight with glasses. I have to open the full resolution to tell the difference between the colors and even then it can be a challenge for some. This issue would be even worse for color-blind editors. We also have issues with the TS color and the timeline background for red color blindness (demonstrated in the above RfC). On the grounds of [[WP:ACCESS]], I am proposing a change to the below colors, which increases the contrast between the weather colors. Please place comments in the discussion section below.

As a compromise between keeping the old scale and improving for WP:ACCESS for color blind, I propose the following new scale. I would also like to make it very clear, '''Consensus was reached above to NOT have ANY links on colored backgrounds''' so the below colors only need to have AA contrast against black text.

{{rfcquote|text=
The issue of using the terms ''[[:mercenaries]]'' v ''[[:auxiliaries]]'' in reference to ''Hessian soldier'' has once again come to the ARW Talk page. To achieve a lasting neutrality it has been suggested that we remove all usages of both ''auxiliaries'' and ''mercenaries'', and just refer to the German soldiers as ''Hessian soldiers'' in a strictly neutral fashion. To help clarify matters we would include a footnote after the first usage of ''[[:Hessian (soldier)]]'' (see proposed footnote directly above) which simply points out that historians often use the two terms interchangeably, while others use either term and offer facts and ideas that lend support to both ''auxiliaries'' and ''mercenaries''. As this debate has occurred many times over the last several years, with no lasting agreement, it would seem this is the best way to put this issue to rest and come up with an article that doesn't leave half the readership disappointed or wondering about the integrity of WP editors.  -- [[User:Gwillhickers|''Gwillhickers'']] ([[User talk:Gwillhickers |talk]]) 22:27, 19 April 2022 (UTC)}}

There are two aspects of the article, Zefr and I cannot agree on:
* Scientific consensus suggests that the primary mode of action of flavan-3-ols is via improving vascular function - that is stated in reference 13. They should therefore be included in the text at least as prominent as the effect on blood lipids.
* Flavan-3-ols have been investigated in a large (n=20,000 subjects, 3.5 yr) clinical trial and shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular-diseases. While this is primary research, it is a large study that provides considerably more evidence for a potential health effect than all other cited evidence as it uses hard endpoints. I therefore belief it has sufficient relevance to be at least mentioned.

Hi, everyone. There was recently some discussion regarding the article's infobox pic. I missed the first round of talks, but I think that this is a pretty important (and sensitive) issue which should be discussed at greater length with more diverse input. I think that the picture, as is the case for every other Nazi military leader and war criminal on Wikipedia, should show him in military dress; not to glorify him, but to show how he looked while he was most influential.

{{rfcquote|text=
I’m renewing a subject that [[User:Stephen Balaban]] began two years ago. Because Stephen had use the term “country”, can we renew the debate whether it’s a “country”, “state” or “partially recognized state”? The term “country” seems to be used by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] and the [[Taiwan independence movement]], but I prefer “partially recognized state” to be more neutral because the Republic of China only controls Taiwan, Penghu and the two small islands of Fujian Province while claiming the territories controlled by the People's Republic of China.

On a contrary, the article’s name “Taiwan” is getting out of hand. Because Taiwan is the island controlled by the Republic of China, its status is still controversial since 1945 since that regime fled the mainland in 1949. There has been much debate and no consensus formed over whether to use the name of the article "Taiwan" or the "Republic of China" when referring to the ROC-controlled territories.

Sound off below.  -[[Special:Contributions/142.112.224.106|142.112.224.106]] ([[User talk:142.112.224.106|talk]]) 23:45, 13 May 2022 (UTC)}}

This RfC is in response to [[Talk:Supertramp#English vs British|a recent edit war regarding Supertramp]], a band that formed in London and had a mix of English, Scottish, and American members. What default position should we take when a band is formed in one country, but contains members who are from elsewhere?
# Band nationality determined by '''place of formation''' ("Supertramp was an Englsh rock band formed in London [...]")
# Band nationality determined by '''nationalities of members''' ("Supertramp was an Anglo-American rock band formed in London [...]")
# as above, but limited to '''nationalities of core or founding members''' (in the Supertramp example, we would be accounting just [[Roger Hodgson]] and [[Rick Davies]], who are both English)
# Band nationality '''ignored''' ("Supertramp was a rock band formed in London [...]")

Some other bands to consider are [[the Velvet Underground]] (American, even though [[John Cale]] is Welsh), [[the Monkees]] (no nationality given), and [[Fleetwood Mac]] (British-American). [[User:ILIL|ili]] ([[User talk:ILIL|talk]]) 20:33, 26 April 2022 (UTC)}}

As the title of the section suggests, should navigational templates for bands, such as [[Template:Megadeth]] have items that do not have their own ''dedicated'' pages or are simply redirects to the respective artists' discography (such as) <nowiki>[[Deathstars#Discography|Decade of Debauchery]]</nowiki>? Obviously redlinks in navboxes are prohibited, but is it okay to include a non-wikilinked item? The subject of this is [[Template:Eisbrecher]], where I have attempted to add a compilation album (best hit album) section for their best hits album Ewiges Eis - 15 Jahre Eisbrecher, but it has been reverted by [[User:Jax 0677]], firstly under the grounds of WTAF, which is not valid since band members who do not have have their respective articles have remained (don't tell me notability reasons, Ewiges Eis charted on German charts) and previous albums that did not have articles (namely Schicksalsmelodien, which I created myself), remained intact. Following a short discussion which Jax has decided to ignore, citing BRD (how is this change even bold??), I have come to here to settle this. He has violated 3RR and I cannot be bothered reporting this to WP:AN/3RR.

I am requesting an additional viewpoint in relation to this issue. Both involved parties (including myself) disagree as to the title of the article. While I don’t have the right to discuss the other parties reasons, my own reasoning is that Jat is the common name of the topic of discussion and that peripatetic refers to a number of groups that are not necessarily Jats hence I am of the opinion that the article name should be kept as is. Most sources including the Encyclopaedia Iranica article and Aparana Rao’s seminal work which I have referenced also use the term Jat.[[User:RuudVanClerk|RuudVanClerk]] ([[User talk:RuudVanClerk|talk]]) 12:40, 12 May 2022 (UTC)}}

Some usages may be allowed if a ''specific edit request is made, only if independent secondary reliable coverage from outside these countries on the topic requested is unavailable, is published in what would otherwise be a generally reliable source at least two days after the event's occurrence (with the exception of official statements of government entities), and there is consensus to introduce it. In particular, avoid using sources liable to censorship by [[Roskomnadzor]].''
*The official statements of the sides shall be described according to independent, secondary, ''reliable'' sources ''[further mentioned as ISRS]'', limiting the scope of mentioning of the official position by the extent to which these positions are expounded on in these sources. Military advances should not be stated as fact unless confirmed by both sides of the conflict, either as separate statements as quoted in ISRSs, or by summary of the statements in ISRSs. All mentions of these positions shall be added with appropriate attribution, in a neutral form, without excessive citations and preserving due weight to them. The addition of the positions of the officials from one side that are not mentioned in ISRSs in order to balance the mentions of the positions of officials mentioned in ISRSs is forbidden, nor should independent assessments of ISRSs be balanced by the statements of officials denying said assessments.

The problem is that Hospitality Club does not really work anymore. But there hasn't been any official statment, because the creator(s) of the project just abandoned it. So, no one takes care about the portal anymore, since February 2021 the login did not work anymore, and since April 2022 the page is even offline. The service already lost its popularity in the years before, and there is no media coverage anymore. The result is, that there is no undisputed source which we could use for citation. I did add the information that the service is not functional anymore and used the [[Wayback Machine]] and some Uptime-Portal for citation, but this was considered as [[WP:OR]]. Otherwise the initiation was changed from "is" to "was" but without citation. So the question here is: Is it really [[WP:OR]], and if yes, will we find another way to get more specific about the current situation of the project, or won't we be able to do any updates unless some media will report about this? - [[User:Flexman|Flexman]] ([[User talk:Flexman|talk]]) 14:10, 2 May 2022 (UTC)}}

I really don't know and I do appreciate that the current editors on this new page have been formatting well and finding sources to build their page.

Should the following paragraph be shortened and move some parts to more relevant sections?  

{{talkquote|According to a RAND Corporation policy report, while in Paris, Massoud Rajavi began to implement an "ideological revolution", which required members an increased study and devotion that later expanded into "near religious devotion to the Rajavis". After its settlement in Iraq, however, it experienced a shortfall of volunteers. This led to the recruitment of members including Iranian dissidents, as well as Iranian economic migrants in countries such as Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, through "false promises of employment, land, aid in applying for asylum in Western countries, and even marriage, to attract them to Iraq". MEK also gave free visit trips to its camps to the relatives of the members. According to the RAND report, the recruited members were mostly brought by MEK into Iraq illegally and then were asked to submit their identity documents for "safekeeping", an act which would "effectively trap" them. With the assistance of Saddam's government, MEK also recruited some of its members from the Iranian prisoners of the Iran-Iraq war.{{sfn|Goulka|Hansell|Wilke|Larson|2009|p=38}} During the second phase of [[#Ideological revolution and women's rights|the ideological revolution]], all members were forced to surrender their individuality to the organization.<ref name="Barker" />|}}

Consensus is Wikipedia's friend. It is the backbone of discussion and the statute which decides all that is done here. However, sometimes I feel it fails to accurately represent the problem at hand. There are certain situations in which stalemates should be enough to continue with the implementation of guidelines/policies (see [[WP:LEADCITE]]).

WP: STALEMATE would address two issues: the relatively minor issue of what to do when stalemate happens, and the controversial issue of what to do when consensus isn't needed to proceed (WP:MINORCONSENT?) I think there is a need for a policy such as this, as sometimes stalemate proves that a problem is important enough to be addressed. This would apply only to specific policies and guidelines, and consensus would take precedent in most cases. What do yall think? Is it serious enough to pursue?

attempted to vote to kill the RFC before it could go active or be noticed on (currently) mistaken procedural grounds. [[WP:RFC]] currently ''recommends'' using short clear questions and avoiding open ended requests but there's nothing about either being ''mandatory'' and the ending policies assume that conversation be allowed to procede until there's consensus that the issues raised have been adequately addressed. The posters above on the other hand truly believed that it was fine to shut off requests for discussion that weren't narrowly tailored to individual questions. (This would seem to require multiple RFCs for a single page when the issues to be addressed, as here, are wide ranging.)

#'''Does WP:RFC need to be rewritten to end all RFCs that are not phrased as short questions?'''
#'''Does it need to be rewritten to ban all open-ended requests for comment?''' or 
#'''Does it need to be rewritten to more clearly explain that RFCs can't be "voted closed" by the group happy with the current page?'''

To my mind, it's clear that more involvement is always helpful, especially on ultrasensitive subjects. I know more recent wikipedians are more generally in favor of tighter gatekeeping, but do the admins really want cliques of local editors shutting out open requests for outside voices? If some specific person is being unhelpful or disruptive, that can be pointed out separately. On the otherhand, {{sc|[[wp:ownership]]}} used to be viewed as a bad thing, which RFC was a tool to help address without brigading or building up teams of allies (which just repeats the same problem at a higher level).&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User talk:LlywelynII|<span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em; class=texhtml">Llywelyn<span style="color: Gold;">II</span></span>]] 16:09, 11 May 2022 (UTC)}}

According to the Star Tribune, Jensen was regarded as a moderate and maverick during his term in the legislature, but his views have shifted to the right after leaving the legislature.

This has been discussed at [[WT:Comics]] many times ([[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics/Archive 50#Essex in X-Men: Apocalypse|one]], [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics/Archive 49#Non-appearances|two]] [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics/Archive 47#Name-drops in other media|three]], [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics/Archive 47#Easter eggs in The Amazing Spider-Man 2|four]], [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics#Doctor Octopus would have been...|five]]), and I'm putting this here to get more/outside perspectives.

Over the last three decades, there have been many superhero films. During development, many characters are considered for inclusion, but not used. Some planned films die in [[Development hell]]. Some characters are alluded to in the film, but not actually present. Examples for your consideration include [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Darkhawk&type=revision&diff=1084164838&oldid=1084161765 a director tweeting that a character was considered], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mister_Sinister&type=revision&diff=721015456&oldid=720946867 an obvious Easter Egg], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zzzax&type=revision&diff=1083766849&oldid=1082059594 unfilmed scripts], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beta_Ray_Bill&type=revision&diff=810510009&oldid=810449546 visual references to the character].

With every new film, there is a wave a editors wanting to add these non-appearances to character articles. There is a large volume of websites catering to fans, and reasonably-acceptable sources can usually be located to support any Easter Egg. The best-sourced material of this kind is often included in franchise articles like [[Spider-Man in film]], but those pages do not always exist.

Gothic metal is associated with gothic subculture. I'm not saying it is or is not a gothic rock subgenre or have any intent on removing gothic rock.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should Disney's political affiliations be included in the infobox? The section "World War II and beyond: 1941–1950" explains in several sentences his partisan affiliation and allegiance. Here are some more sources on his political involvement: [https://worldofwalt.com/walt-disney-conservative-liberal.html 1], [https://www.discovery.org/e/5769/ 2], [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/26/film.usa 3]. Disney was lightly involved in Democratic politics, but during The Second World War and the Cold War Disney became known for his conservative and staunchly anti-communist views. His brother [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]], who was also politically active, has his party in his own infobox.

I, personally, do not feel strongly one way or another about including this, but would love to gage other editors' opinions. -- [[User:Titi68999|Titi68999]] ([[User talk:Titi68999|talk]]) 17:09, 3 June 2022 (UTC)}}

An editor is seeking consistently to add this article (imo) excessive citations, for sources which may not be considered reliable, relsting to corrspondence between [[Fredieric Chopin]] and Woychiechowski. The issue relates to some sentences in a letter from Chopin which contain references which can be costrued as homoerotic on Chopin's part, although the consensus of Chopin scholars is that this is, at best "not proven". Some of the above comments on this talk page relate to this. No evidence exists of any sort to suggest that Woychiechowski was homosexual at any time in his life. To stress Chopin's correspondnce with Woychiechowski in this article is [[WP:UNDUE]] and certainly not [[WP:NPOV]]. The issue of Chopin's homosexuality itself was addressed in an [[Talk:Frédéric_Chopin/Archive_23#RFC:_Chopin_and_Sexuality|RfC at Frederic Chopin]] which editors are invited to consult.

Should this article about a particular method of suicide continue to include (i.e. keep) a list of specifically-named notable people who have died by this particular method? Does such a list have substantial value to explain or illustrate the topic of this article? Or should the existing list be removed (i.e. remove) with the consensus that it not be replaced without a new future consensus to do so?

The list in question is, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suicide_by_jumping_from_height&oldid=1091839275 as of this writing], the list beginning with "Prominent examples of autodefenestration include..." followed by a list of linked names.

''What this RFC is not:'' This is not on the question of whether such a list should not be included (a) due to concerns about either sensitivity for the surviving friends and relatives of people on the list, (b) due to concerns about whether such a list publicizes suicide in a way that might empower or encourage living individuals to kill themselves by this method of suicide or in general, or (c) similar concerns. This RFC is also not about the sentence beginning "The highest documented suicide jump..."

''What this RFC is:'' This is only about whether the list benefits this article under ordinary Wikipedia principles for inclusions of lists of things in articles.

Please weigh in by beginning with '''Keep '''or '''Remove '''or '''Other ''' meaning, respectively, '''Keep '''the existing list in the article, '''Remove '''the existing list from the article and do not replace it without a new future consensus to do so, or '''Other''' and explain.

* I think yes. Slight preference to both, but either will do, really. My arguments can be found both above, and [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard#Image for Jessica Cisneros|at the BLPN]], but basically Zaereth said it best at BLPN - this image is a thousand times better than no image. We are here to improve the article, not to act as Cisneros's PR agency. Now that doesn't mean we should harm her, we shouldn't, we should certainly try to find a middle ground between that and improving the article - but leaving information, this image, ''out'' either because she looks young in it, or because it draws too much attention to the fact that she ran twice against the guy she formerly interned for, is bending too far over backwards in a misguided attempt to improve her political career. We don't do that. Arguing that an image that was fine when it was taken, then becomes a BLP violation a few years later is ... let's say overstating the case. This is the image we have, and it is a fair one. If we get a better one, great: we worked hard to look for one, we asked her representatives, they didn't respond, we found another one, it was deleted; until we get a better one, it will do, and if we never get a better one, it will also do. --[[User:GRuban|GRuban]] ([[User talk:GRuban|talk]]) 15:31, 7 July 2022 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The term "Past perfect" redirects here. Should the redirect go to [[Past perfect (disambiguation)|Past perfect disambiguation page]] instead of this page?

*'''Yes''' it should. As nominator I will explain my rationale. First, it seems more likely someone would plug in "past perfect" as a Wikipedia search term to look for a book title, a film title, an album title or some other kind of media. Check out the linked disambiguation page above for more clarity on that. It is true that the [[OED]], says "past perfect" is a synonym for "pluperfect." 

:However, this does not mean that it as widely used as the term "past perfect." For instance, in school I learned about "past perfect" but  "pluperfect" was never brought to my attention. I have to say "pluperfect" must be close to being archaic, even though the OED does say this word is in current use. Also, I just noticed even this article says, "'pluperfect' [is] usually called 'past perfect' in English" - first line of the intro. ---[[User:Steve Quinn|Steve Quinn]] ([[User talk:Steve Quinn|talk]]) 03:59, 8 July 2022 (UTC)}}

See [[#14th : Elizabeth II for Jamaica]] section above. I've noticed the inconsistency with having Elizabeth as 2nd and 14th longest-reigning monarch(s?), and other wikipedians have. But at least one wikipedian (two ? I'm not sure what Peter O. thinks about this specific number question) disagree, the discussion can't go further. There's also the more general issue of having two separate Elizabeth entry (one for Jamaica and one for the other countries), me and others are also against it, but it seems to me that it's less important as it's a presentation issue, not an inconstistency issue.

{{rfcquote|text=
An editor has added false information about the demographics of Balochistan claiming that:

1. Baloch make up 60% in the province
 
2. There are Turks living in the area

In support of the first point a random newspaper article is claimed source (whose numbers are contrary to any official source). While for the second point only imagination has been used. 

I first tried to update the numbers to 2017 census (latest census) i.e. Baloch make up 35% and there are no Turks in the area. But after discussing with other editors I came to know that there is no official definition of "Baloch ethnicity", and numerous Barahvi, Pashto, Sindhi and Seraiki speaking communities also identify as Baloch. So in that effect I preferred to remove that information to keep the article clean of imaginations, and just stick to facts.

All of my edits were removed by the editor who added the baseless numbers in the first place, claiming that his version WP:STATUSQUO

Also, there is no such thing as 2008 census. The 2008 data is based on 1998 census in which Pashtuns were underrepresented (see discussion), while in 2017 their representation was restored (and hence the jump in their numbers).

Added inline flag on a part of sentence that claims the show has political affiliation. It is within the synopsis section. This section contains zero citations, though I understand a tv show synopsis may not need a ton (or should this section have citations?). However, a claim is made within this section regarding the “hinting” of political affiliation with one party. I respectfully ask for some sort of verifiable evidence of this claim, especially considering that it is widely reported that the show avoids party affiliation.

{{rfcquote|text=
Recently there was controversy over what map or other image, if any, should be placed in the article's lead, eventually an RfC was held, with the conclusion that there was consensus against the proposed maps due to concerns over original research, but given that the only users who took part in it were ones who were already involved in the dispute, I thought it was appropriate to at least have further discussion on this issue.

I made some proposals which were already mentioned above:

# The world map based on The Man in the High Castle, which was recently removed: [[c:File:The Man in the High Castle Plausible World Map.png]]
# A world map based on Fatherland: [[c:File:Fatherland.png]]
# Another map based on Fatherland, but this time of Europe only, this was the one originally in the lead: [[c:File:Fatherland's 1964 Europe.jpg]]
# A model of the Volkshalle, which was to be built if Germany won: [[c:File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1986-029-02, "Germania", Modell "Große Halle".jpg]]
# A broader model of "Germania", the planned rebuilding of Berlin: [[c:File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146III-373, Modell der Neugestaltung Berlins ("Germania").jpg]]

Other suggestions would be welcomed. -- [[Special:Contributions/2804:248:f650:6600:86f:165c:bba5:8f4|2804:248:f650:6600:86f:165c:bba5:8f4]] ([[User talk:2804:248:f650:6600:86f:165c:bba5:8f4|talk]]) 04:51, 11 June 2022 (UTC)}}

This is a dispute over yes or no of a rewrite of lead sentence of the current "Comfort Women" article. The content of the dispute is shown in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Comfort_women#Suggested_changes_to_first_paragraph Talk]. We agree that there are two opinions about "comfort women": "licensed prostitutes" and "sex slaves", and also that we have exhausted our arguments. In the current article, the first paragraph reads, "Comfort women or comfort girls were women and girls '''forced into sexual slavery''' by the Imperial Japanese Army ..."　and the writing of "licensed prostitutes claim”is excluded as this basis. To maintain neutrality,  shouldn't this paragraph be changed to, for example, "Comfort women or comfort girls were women and girls '''to provide sexual services''' to the Imperial Japanese Army..." ?

The reason for oppositon to the writing of "licensed prostitutes" is based on the claim that the majority of comfort women is sex slaves. There is an objection to "majority of sex slaves" with evidence. Even if they are a minority, wouldn't be against wiki's 5P1 and 5P2 to exclude dissenting opinions ? Please read through Talk and comment. If you have any questions, I will answer them. [[User:Eyagi|Eyagi]] ([[User talk:Eyagi|talk]]) 05:19, 29 June 2022 (UTC)}}

RFC on Page name

I'm not sure why this page is still referred to as "Aunt Jemima", but then I saw the two page move requests up top and understand why.

The argument for before was [[WP:COMMONNAME]] but I think this doesn't meet that, Aunt Jemima is not a common name. But it fails [[WP:NAMECHANGES]] at this point. This is not a self published name change, there are plenty of [https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/31/business/pearl-milling-company-aunt-jemima/index.html reliable sources] verifying the branding name change. Even the Common Name part says "Although official, scientific, birth, original, or trademarked names are often used for article titles, the term or name most typically used in reliable sources is generally preferred."

So, should this stay Aunt Jemima, or should this go the way of [[The Chicks]], [[Lady A]], [[Ben's Original]], and [[Washington Commanders]], and let the new name reflect on this page? [[User:FrederalBacon|FrederalBacon]] ([[User talk:FrederalBacon|talk]]) 16:09, 13 July 2022 (UTC)}}

"The church is supposed to direct the government. The government is not supposed to direct the church. That is not how our founding fathers intended it. And I am tired of this separation of church and state junk. It's not in the Constitution."[https://www.npr.org/2022/07/01/1109141110/the-christian-right-is-winning-cultural-battles-while-public-opinion-disagrees?t=1657193726927]

As historian Neff notes, the Civil War lacks a precise end date: "In practice, the war was brought to an end on a piecemeal basis, by way of a welter of specific measures by the Union government." But since we remain in the business of conveying information, '''how should we communicate the end date in the infobox?''' Please peruse the above sections, with excellent research by Donner60 and company. The following dates stand out, but your solution needn't be limited to those listed:
*April 9: Lee surrenders at Appomattox Courthouse, setting in motion a wave of surrenders. The earliest possible date we could claim.
*April 26: Johnston's large force surrenders. John Wilkes Booth killed.
*May 5: Effective dissolution of the Confederate government.
*May 9: The disputed, but ''status quo ante'' version. Refers to Johnson's proclamation that belligerent rights are at an end.
*May 10: Confederate President Jeff Davis captured.
*May 13: Battle of Palmetto ranch, last of the war.
*May 26: Edmund Kirby Smith's forces surrender, last large force surrender. Later argued as the end date by the Government.
*June 2: Department of the Trans-Mississippi ordered to stand down.
*June 19: Juneteenth, the slaves of Texas are freed.
*June 22: ''Shenandoah'', unaware of Lee and Johnston's surrender, fires the last shots of the war.
*June 23: Stand Watie is the last Confederate general/land force to surrender.
*November 6: ''Shenandoah'' surrenders in the UK, the last naval surrender.
*August 20, 1866: President Johnson declares the insurrection suppressed. The last date we could claim. Supreme Court declares this as the end date for legal purposes.

Other possible approaches include:
*1865
*Spring 1865
*April-June 1865
*April-May 1865
*May 1865
*[Date] (disputed)
*[Date] (exact end date disputed)
*[Date] (debatable)
*[Date] (exact end date debatable)
*[Date] (effective)
The topic is also covered at [[Conclusion of the American Civil War]], though the above research has exposed the article as rather lacking.

It has been almost 15 years since it was delisted from the title and it has certainly a better article from then. All opinions are welcome but the main question I'm asking is do you think it's ready to be nominated again? Thanks!

{{rfcquote|text=
How should UK churches be sorted in categories in en.wiki?  For background, including links to previous inconclusive discussions, please see the section [[#DEFAULTSORT for churches]] above. Note that articles on UK churches have a wide variety of title formats. Consider [[St Chad's Church, Far Headingley]], but also:
* [[St Mark's Church, Woodhouse, Leeds]]
* [[Church of St Thomas the Apostle, Killinghall]]
* [[Parish church of St Giles, St Giles in the Wood]]
* [[Bethel Chapel, Ynysybwl]]
* [[Lenton Methodist Church]]
* [[The Holy Sepulchre, Northampton]]
* [[Church of Christ the King, Bloomsbury]]
* [[Mount St Mary's Church, Leeds]]
* [[Leeds Minster]]
*[[Our Lady of Mount Carmel and St Simon Stock]]. 
(It is of course possible that some of these should have other article titles).

The practice of expanding "St" or "St." to "Saint" is mandated by [[WP:SORTKEY]] and appears uncontroversial, so "Sort by article title" or similar, in this RfC, can be taken to mean "Sort by title with "St" expanded to "Saint" (and with a leading "The" removed in rare cases)".

The only existing guidance on sortkeys appears to be that at [[WP:SORTKEY]], which includes the option that "{{tq|Systematic sort keys are also used in other categories where the logical sort order is not alphabetical (for example, individual month articles in year categories such as Category:2004 use sort keys like "*2004-04" for April). Again, such systems must be used consistently within a category.}}". There is no one Wikiproject dedicated to UK churches, though they come within the interests of many Wikiprojects: [[WP:WikiProject Christianity|Christianity]] and its denominational subprojects; [[WP:WikiProject Architecture|Architecture]]; [[WP:WikiProject United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]; and [[WP:WikiProject UK geography|UK geography]] and its country, county or regional subprojects. [[WP:WikiProject Categories|Categories]] is also relevant. There seems no obvious place to record the consensus with which this RfC will close, but an archived RfC lodged in the wiki-memory of a variety of editors will be useful. If agreement can be reached, we can (a) move towards consistent sorting within categories and (b) avoid conflict between editors and time wasted in changing DEFAULTSORTs.

{{rfcquote|text=
There has been heated debate recently over the claim by some editors that all train stations are inherently notable. Proponents of this idea say there is a long-term consensus establishing inherent notability of train stations. Opponents state that there is not a specific policy or guideline establishing any inherent notability. An RfC was held in 2019 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Notability/Archive_65#Request_for_comment_on_train_station_notability] on this question, and closed with no consensus to find all train stations inherently notable, while also identifying several aspects of the question to be further considered. I am starting this RfC to follow up on the previous one in 2019, and attempt to come to an answer on the question of inherent notability for train stations. 

I foresee the following possible outcomes of this discussion:
# All train stations are inherently notable.
# Some subset of train stations are inherently notable (for instance, excluding [[flag stop]]s).
# Train stations are inherently notable, but may still be merged into other articles, a la [[WP:NOPAGE]].
# Train stations do not have any inherent notability, and must be evaluated individually against [[WP:GNG]] and/or subject-specific notability guidelines. [[User:Trainsandotherthings|Trainsandotherthings]] ([[User talk:Trainsandotherthings|talk]]) 22:23, 2 July 2022 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Which color scheme is more accessible? The current colors (CC) or the proposed colors (PC)?

The legacy colors (LC) are shown on the table for reference, however, I will make it very clear that we are NOT reverting back to those colors as they have serious accessibility issues. People inside and outside this project have acknowledged these colors are not acceptable due to their incompatibility with [[MOS:ACCESS]]. Comments that are made solely to attempt to revert back to the legacy colors due to work it may create or on [[WP:IDONTLIKEIT]] grounds should not be considered as a result. The legacy colors must go or else articles may lose their GA and FA statuses for failing to be accessible.

The current colors were recently approved in the last RfC when the proposal to change them was rejected. I believe these colors are hard to distinguish between on track maps for the dots for those who have monochromatic color blindness. Keep in mind that this also fixes the maps for people printing them in black and white (two birds with one stone). There simply isn't enough contrast between the colors to tell them apart on the grey scale. We also have issues with the TS color and the timeline background for red color blindness (demonstrated below) which hasn't been fixed since people want to keep the background unchanged. On the grounds of [[WP:ACCESS]], I am proposing a change to the below colors, which increases the contrast between the weather colors. <s>Please place preliminary comments in the feedback section below.</s> Please leave comments for the RfC in the discussion section below.

As a compromise between keeping the old scale and improving for WP:ACCESS for color blind, I propose the following new scale. I would also like to make it very clear, '''Consensus was reached above to NOT have ANY links on colored backgrounds''' so the below colors only need to have AA contrast against black text.

{{rfcquote|text=
The situation. On March 1st the governing bodies of tennis (ATP,WTA,ITF) told the world that no Russian or Belarus player can play a tennis tournament under their nation's flag because of the attack on Ukraine by Russian forces. All tournaments agreed and since that time you will see no player nationality listed at any tournament. No problems there. However, authorities did not say they would remove all nationalities from rankings, nor did it say that we should erase the nationality of a player for other reasons. The ATP website software seems to have a problem in that it removed all traces of nationality of Russian/Belarus players... everything. [https://www.atptour.com/en/players/daniil-medvedev/mm58/overview Daniil Medvedev's bio shows no trace of his Russian flag]. Rankings [https://www.atptour.com/en/rankings/singles?rankRange=0-100&rankDate=2020-12-28 from 2020 also show no nationality]. This is a software error and makes missing nationality from rankings on the ATP and WTA unreliable at the moment.

If we use other sources for rankings we see a different picture. [https://www.espn.com/tennis/rankings ESPN rankings], [https://www.foxsports.com/tennis/atp/rankings FOX rankings], [http://stats.washingtonpost.com/tennis/rankings.asp?tour=ATP Washington Post rankings], [https://tennisabstract.com/reports/atpRankings.html Tennis Abstract rankings]... these all show a nationality... as they should. Individual tournaments, which we can source, are a different matter. Nationality is not allowed for the tournaments and those affected players are allowed to enter team events.

These ranking templates will be affected:
*[[Template:Current ATP singles rankings]]
*[[Template:Current WTA singles rankings]]
*[[Template:Current WTA doubles individual rankings]]
*[[Template:Current ATP doubles individual rankings]]

These templates are used in multiple articles and inside other templates, and readers have complained about missing nationalities where I have no good answer for them. Since I see no large discussion of this and another editor and I are at a complete impasse, I have started this RfC.

{{rfcquote|text=
The issue can be reviewed in the exchanges by editors in the above section, "Ableist phrasing". It has been speculated that Alkan suffered from Aspergers syndrome and/or other ilnesses. This speculation is cited in the article. The use of the word 'suffer' was originally queried by [[User:Smasongarrison]], and that query was contested by [[User:Mathsci]] and myself. Smasongarisson's justifications were basically on a [[WP:OR]] basis; when they were contested in the above section, Smasongarisson demurred from giving further explanation (although they did subsequently repeat their edit, which I reverted).

That might have been the end of the episode. What gives me concern here is that this episode was, for reasons I do not comprehend, brought up in a [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive1101#User%3AMathsci_at_Double_group|separate discussion on User:Mathsci, concerning another WP article]], whch resulted in a site ban for Mathsci. I do not understand the issues of the formal objections in that discussion, I did not contribute to it (although for some reason my name was mentioned in it), and I have no views on the outcome or on the decision re Mathsci. 

However it seems to have been as a consequence of that discussion, which had no bearing on the issues of the article [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]], that [[User:Amakuru]] has resolved to repeat Smasongarrison's unsupported edit to this article. In doing so they have imo seriously misconstrued WP guidelines in a way which threatens the freedom of WP editors to use standard English in the way that they choose. In particular they have summonned to justify their edit  [[WP:SUFFER]] - which is specifically a part of (quote) "the style guide for editing medical articles. The general rules from the Wikipedia:Manual of Style also apply when writing medical articles." The present article  is not a medical article, and this guideline clearly does not apply here.

I set out again here my comments from the section above: "McCallum suggests Alkan may have had these disorders and that they may have detracted from his social, physical and mental abilities. That is, (in normal English usage), that he suffered from them. The sentence in the article reflects these comments by McCallum. There is absolutely nothing in the present phrasing that suggests that "the lives of those with Asperger's, schizophrenia, and ocd are less valued." "

The article might indeed use a direct citation by McCallum as follows: ""His life has been regarded as a puzzle – Ronald Smith calls it an enigma. I would like to speculate that - like Schumann, Wolff, Satie and possibly even Mozart – Alkan may have suffered from a serious mental illness which affected his ability to engage successfully with the world." (see [http://alkansociety.org/Publications/Society-Bulletins/Bulletin75.pdf McCallum ASB75]). Are we to rewrite citations in line with prejudices about language? - that would seriously undermine WP as a work of reference. 

I should be grateful for editors' opinions on this issue, which has very important implications far beyond this article. If editors are going to be nit-picked on their use of language by anyone who wishes to construe that certain words, part of everday discourse, may risk offending some others - then the foundations of Wikipedia are imo theatened.--[[User:Smerus|Smerus]] ([[User talk:Smerus|talk]]) 13:05, 25 June 2022 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Following on from various AFDs and other discussions in recent years (e.g., [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Abadi Zavarzmand Shomareh Mowtowr 55|this one]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ağcakent, Aziziye|this one]], [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive1064#Mass-creating articles based on one unreliable source|this one]], [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_357#RfC%3A_GNIS|this one]], [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard/Archive 362#GEOnet Names Server %28GNS%29|this one]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Paşakonağı, Düzce|this one]], and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Emmet, North Dakota|this one]]), it can be seen that there is a difference as to whether, and to what degree, rural localities such as Iranian ''[[Abadi (rural locality)|ābādī]]'', Turkish ''[[Mahallah#Turkey|Mahalle]]'', and similar unincorporated communities/localities having people live in/about them should be presumed notable. 

At AFD it is typically to see, on the one hand, people pointing out that we have many [[Wikipedia:MASSCREATE|mass-produced]] stub-articles for locations for which the only source is a bare-mention in a statistical database or in a long list of place-names, and this being a violation of [[WP:NOT]]. On the other hand, you typically see people expressing the view that as well as being an encyclopaedia Wikipedia should be a [[gazetteer]] and should therefore include all such localities for which there is a source regardless of the depth of coverage. 

Both sides appeal to [[WP:GEOLAND]]#1 as supporting their point of view, typically based on very different interpretations of the meaning of {{tq|"populated, legally recognized places"}} and {{tq|"census tracts"}}. The [[WP:GEOLAND]] guide is therefore not resolving the issue. The availability of redirection per [[WP:NOPAGE]] also does not seem to resolve the issue.

It is therefore sensible to test the community consensus on this. I foresee four possible outcomes:

::1. All places having anyone recorded living at or near them ever (e.g., in obituaries, [[Wikipedia:Run-of-the-mill|run-of-the-mill]] news stories about people from them etc.) are presumed notable.
::2. All places having anyone ever recorded living at or near them in an official document (e.g., official list of place-names, census) are presumed notable, all others should be evaluated individually against [[WP:GNG]].
::3. All populated places having ever had a degree of self-governance conferred through a process of law (e.g., incorporated/chartered towns and cities) are presumed notable, all others should be evaluated individually against [[WP:GNG]].
::4. Populated locations have no presumption of notability, and must be evaluated individually against WP:GNG.<br/>

I would like the article to have an encyclopedic summary of the findings of all relevant sources.

The article as I found it a few days ago had only a single source, [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard#drugs.com for MEDRS|the source was not (A) nor (B) at all, it was 90% not (C) nor (D) either.]] And of course way the Wikipedia article summarized the source is also pretty much the exact opposite way I would summarize the sources that meet (A) (B) (C) and (D). So I would like the changes I have made to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lavender_oil&diff=prev&oldid=1095463391 stand as they do now]<ref>(EDIT: link added to what I'm referring to from before Zefr reverted)</ref>, add more details about the findings of these papers (e.g. which symptoms does it treat exactly?), also add other relevant sources like possibly [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lavender_oil&type=revision&diff=1095500165&oldid=1095480708 this] and [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-54529-9 this] and [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28511598/ this].

* Are the journals I linked above appropriate for the article? Namely "Scientific Reports", "Brain and Behavior", and "The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry".

* Also I would like to input on the journal [[Phytomedicine (journal)|Phytomedicine]]. Wikipedia editor Zefr removed the citation to a study in it because of its appearance in the [[WP:CITEWATCH]] list. However, Wikipedia editors put the journal on that list simply by tagging the journal's wikipedia article with "Herbalism", so the reasoning as it stands it pretty weak. Would love more input it or at the very least if [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lavender_oil&type=revision&diff=1095500165&oldid=1095480708 this article] was okay to use.

''(Optional). One final note: Assuming that the community at large agrees that a journal is reliable and uses it, and a paper published in the journal meets criteria (A)(B)(C), and (D): what place does a wikipedia editor have to remove it as a citation because they personally disagree with the paper's conclusions or the methodology they used to reach those conclusions? Does removing such sources for those reasons not fall under [[Wikipedia:Original research|original research]]? I ask this because it seems to be a recurring theme during this dispute to prefer [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard#drugs.com for MEDRS|drugs.com (where the methodology isn't even stated)]] and remove recent meta-analyses from peer-reviewed journals.''

# these laudations are reproduced on the Fields Medal website (potentially giving an appearance of authoritativeness)
# in the years 1958, 1996, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, an official & short citation was announced together with the awarding of the medal, e.g. that Klaus Roth (1958) won "for solving a famous problem of number theory, namely, the determination of the exact exponent in the Thue-Siegel inequality" and that Andrei Okounkov (2006) won "for his contributions bridging probability, representation theory and algebraic geometry"
# for every single medalist from 1936 to the present, a domain expert has written (for the occasion of the ICM) a short essay about the medalist's work. Sometimes (depending on the individual taste of the expert) this is about a few particular results they find interesting and sometimes it is an overall appraisal of the medalist's entire body of work. In neither case is it indicated that the commentary therein provides "the reason" for the medal to be awarded. The general rule seems to be only that it is a personal celebration of the medalist on the occasion of their fields medal.
# Some of the awardees (e.g. Hironaka, Freedman) did specific results for which it is (informally, to mathematicians) clear that they won the medal. Some other awardees (e.g. Milnor, Grothendieck, Yau) have an entire body of work, many parts of which could be considered Fields-worthy by various people.
The question is how to (systematically or quasi-systematically) resolve this on the page. There are maybe four possible solutions:
# Leave the current table as is
# replace the non-official laudations with short quotes or summaries from the essays about the medalist's work (such as is presently done for the 1990, 1994, 2002 medalists)
# only give the official citations (from 1958, 1998, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018) and leave other entries blank
# (later edit, quoting David Eppstein's suggestion below) replace the non-official laudations with "properly-sourced description of the winner's most significant contributions to mathematics, up to the time of the award, without wording it in a way that implies that those contributions were the specific trigger for the award"

Due to concerns raised by [[User:Onetwothreeip|Onetwothreeip]] at [[Talk:Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] and [[Talk:Russo-Ukrainian War]] that I started the RM "without their permission", I am proposing the following two changes:

#Make the "discuss" links at [[WP:RM/TR]] visible only to the original requester. This would require adding a new <nowiki>{{CURRENTUSERNAME}}</nowiki> magic word (see [[phab:T311794|T311794]]).
#Add a "notify requester" link to [[Template:RMassist/core]] that would either notify the requester that the discussion has been moved to a full RM (if #1 is opposed) or ask them whether they agree to start the RM (if #1 is supported).

Should we implement one or both changes? Please say below whether you support or oppose each change. If you support #2, then please also say whether you support or oppose making notifying the requester mandatory.

 In the preceding section, I pointed that this article ([[Glossary of areas of mathematics]]) is a [[WP:INDISCRIMINATE]] list <s>of things that are sometimes areas of mathematics, and sometimes not</s> <u>in which some entries are areas of mathematics and some are not</u>. So clear inclusion criteria are required. I suggested the following criteria:

For being included an area must satisfy at least one of the following conditions:
# Being commonly the name of a course in colleges or universities 
# Being the title of a textbook (research monographies being excluded per [[WP:OR]])
# Being explicitly in the scope of a mathematical journal or of a recurrent international mathematical conference (an isolated conference does not warrant the notoriety of the subject).

{{rfcquote|text=
In her paper 'Συμβολή στην ιστορία του βορειοηπειρωτικού ελληνισμού τα τέλη του 16ου αιώνα: Ματθαίος Παπαγιάννης' (2013), Katerina Korre - who references archival materials such as the Ottoman registers - states that the region of Dropull was Christian and Greek-speaking during the early 16th century. While it is clear from the archival evidence that the region was Christian, they do not comment on the linguistic character of the region - be it Albanian or Greek. As such, there is no evidential basis for her claim and I propose that it should not be used on the article. Her claim is further contradicted by cited paper by Duka (1990) who transliterated the register of 1520 and noted that there was a predominance of Albanian personal names in the region - many of which can only be explained through Albanian (e.g., ''Djalosh'', ''Progor'', ''Bardh'') and show Albanian linguistic influence (e.g., the suffix -''ush''). This makes Korre's claim that the region was exclusively Greek-speaking during the 16th century even more unlikely.   

As for Duka's claim that the lack of names ending in the -''s'' suffix indicating no Greek linguistic influence in the anthroponyms, I am okay with either removing the statement or keeping the counter-argument presented by @[[User:Alexikoua|Alexikoua]].

{{rfcquote|text=
In all the instances I have ever seen pound ''sterling'' is an adjective, not a compound noun, and if there are pence in the amount cited "sterling" is still suffixed, for example "the exchange rate is at 100 {{char|currency A}} to 1 pound 25 pence ''sterling''", not "1 ''pound sterling'' 25 pence".

The Oxford English Dictionary seems pretty confident that it is indeed an adjective to describe an amount as "lawful English money" and not of some other currency.[https://www.oed.com/oed2/00237275;jsessionid=EFEED8FD76DF746FC4BF279DD29B6407] It is cited as a contraction of the statement "pounds [of] sterlings".

The Royal Mint also seem pretty happy to claim it as an adjective [https://www.royalmintmuseum.org.uk/journal/history/pounds-shillings-and-pence/].

{{Quote|text=In explaining the origins of the word the numismatist Professor Philip Grierson associated sterling with the Middle English ster, meaning strong, rigid or fixed. And looking to the numismatic evidence, he observed that towards the end of the reign of William I (1066-1087) the penny had become heavier and that, contrary to the variations which had occurred in previous reigns, it had then remained at the same weight for the next two centuries. Consistently uniform at 22.5 grains, this English, or more accurately Norman, penny gained a deserved reputation abroad as a strong and fixed currency; and Professor Grierson demonstrated that the earliest references to sterling pennies in continental documents, all of them significantly post-Conquest, '''used the word sterling as an adjective in precisely this sense'''.
As the range of denominations grew with the issue of farthings and halfpennies, half-groats and groats, gold nobles and their fractions, so the name sterling came to represent the English currency as a whole. And if this was especially the case abroad, it was also true at home, for both Chaucer in the 14th century and Shakespeare 200 years later provide instances of sterling being used in this way in a domestic context.}}

I hope this can be a fruitful discussion. [[User:TheCurrencyGuy|TheCurrencyGuy]] ([[User talk:TheCurrencyGuy|talk]]) 13:28, 9 July 2022 (UTC)}}

<s>A tweet by Steven Pinker agreeing with Richard Dawkins agreeing with a list by Jerry Coyne of ideological perversions of science included the idea that race is a social construct. Race (human categorization) claims there is a consensus ("Modern science regards...") about this, which I find hard to square with disagreement by these eminent biologists. Whether race is a valid biological concept is of course a question for biologists, who could situate it in normal taxonomic practice. For example they would know observations like "more genetic variation within groups" was typical among subspecific taxa, whereas a cultural anthropologist or even a medic would likely not. I raised the question of how this consensus was established on the talk page[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Race_(human_categorization)#Consensus], it seems to be merely asserted. Responses were evasive. So perhaps Wikiproject Biology can help. [[User:Bogestra Bob|Bogestra Bob]] ([[User talk:Bogestra Bob|talk]]) 08:19, 4 August 2022 (UTC)}}

Recently there was controversy over what map or other image, if any, should be placed in the article's lead, eventually an RfC was held, with the conclusion that there was consensus against the proposed maps due to concerns over original research, but given that the only users who took part in it were ones who were already involved in the dispute, I thought it was appropriate to at least have further discussion on this issue.

I made some proposals which were already mentioned above:

# The world map based on The Man in the High Castle, which was recently removed: [[c:File:The Man in the High Castle Plausible World Map.png]]
# A world map based on Fatherland: [[c:File:Fatherland.png]]
# Another map based on Fatherland, but this time of Europe only, this was the one originally in the lead: [[c:File:Fatherland's 1964 Europe.jpg]]
# A model of the Volkshalle, which was to be built if Germany won: [[c:File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1986-029-02, "Germania", Modell "Große Halle".jpg]]
# A broader model of "Germania", the planned rebuilding of Berlin: [[c:File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146III-373, Modell der Neugestaltung Berlins ("Germania").jpg]]

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
Currently, the article states that the Queen's reign in all her present realms began when her father died in 1952, which is actually not the case.

;The case of PNG and Tuvalu

*{{flagicon|Papua New Guinea}} Papua New Guinea actually invited the Queen to be head of state on independence in 1975. The country's Constitution states, "Her Majesty the Queen having been requested by the people of Papua New Guinea, through their Constituent Assembly, to become the Queen and Head of State of Papua New Guinea; and having graciously consented so to become, is the Queen and Head of State of Papua New Guinea". Before 1971, it was known as "[[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]]". So, to say that the Queen has reigned over the "[[Independent State of Papua New Guinea]]" since 1952 as its sovereign monarch is wrong, as there was no entity called "Papua New Guinea" until 1971.

*{{flagicon|Tuvalu}} Before Tuvalu's independence in 1978, the colony was known as the Ellice Islands, and it was part of a bigger colony called "[[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]]". The Constitution of independent Tuvalu states, "On 1 October 1975, Her Most Excellent Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was graciously pleased to establish the Ellice Islands as a separate colony under their ancient name of Tuvalu". So, to say that Elizabeth II has been Queen of "[[Tuvalu]]" since 1952 is absolutely incorrect. The Constitution states, "Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God Queen ..., having at the request of the people of Tuvalu graciously consented, is the Sovereign of Tuvalu and, in accordance with this Constitution, the Head of State". So, per the Constitution which went into effect in 1978, the Queen is Tuvalu's Sovereign at the request of the people of Tuvalu, not since 1952. 

;Other issues

Here are few other examples of how the current version of the article is wrong and misleading:

*{{flagicon|Belize}} Belize became independent in 1981. Before 1973, it was known as "[[British Honduras]]". It was a Crown Colony of the United Kingdom, so the Queen reigned ''in Right of the United Kingdom'', not Belize's own sovereign monarch. So, it incorrect to say that Elizabeth II has been the sovereign monarch of "[[Belize]]", since 1952.

*{{flagicon|Antigua and Barbuda}} Antigua and Barbuda achieved sovereignity in 1981. When King George VI died in 1952, the islands were part of the [[British Leeward Islands]], and later in 1958 joined the [[West Indies Federation]], both of which were British colonies. So, it is wrong to say that the Queen has reigned over "[[Antigua and Barbuda]]" as its sovereign monarch since 1952.

*{{flagicon|Saint Kitts and Nevis}} Saint Kitts and Nevis became independent in 1983. Before that it was part of [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]], which was a British Colony. So, Elizabeth II didn't become Queen of "[[Saint Kitts and Nevis]]" in 1952.

At her Coronation in 1953, the Archbishop asked the Queen, "Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the Peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon..?" No explicit mention of many of her present realms like [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[The Bahamas]], [[Belize]], [[Grenada]], [[Jamaica]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Solomon Islands]], and [[Tuvalu]], as these became her realms on independence, not in 1952.

'''Proposal'''

The Queen has reigned as a sovereign monarch since 1952 only in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. It's in these realms where she has been reigning for more than 70 years, which makes her the second-longest reigning sovereign in history. Also, these are the only countries left from her Coronation Oath that she is still monarch of. So, including any other countries here is inaccurate and misleading, and it creates clutter and misses the point of the article.

So, I suggest that the Queen's realms be whittled down to just these four realms, and a note may be added about the other realms of which she became sovereign after 1952. <span style="font-family:'Linux Libertine','Georgia','Times',serif">'''[[User:Peter Ormond|<span style="color:#113680"> Peter Ormond </span>]][[User talk:Peter Ormond|<span style="background:#d9cc6c; color:white; padding:2px;">&#128172;</span>]]'''</span> 00:26, 15 July 2022 (UTC)}}

Greetings, politics lovers!
Since the [[Respect for Marriage Act]] will be broadening the definition of marriage to anything we want it to be, I'm thinking of how we can uniformly address marriage issues in articles, especially about political views.
* "[[Traditional marriage]]" is a political term often used by conservatives, which tends to refer to "one-man, one-woman" [[complementarianism]] and additionally, [[child-bearing]] couples and permanent unions without divorce. Unfortunately not many supporters of Traditional Marriage can really agree on what it means.
* "[[Same-sex marriage]]" is of course a specific and recent issue which is narrow in scope.
* "[[Marriage equality]]" is a broadly inclusive political term, and I would argue that it's equivalent to "traditional marriage" in [[WP:POV]] political framing; they're both buzzwords or Shibboleths indicating support for a specific tapestry of beliefs about gender. "Marriage equality" as a neologism may also be as poorly-defined as "Traditional marriage" and subject to shifting connotations as time advances.

* Now, generally in political articles we've been writing about how politicians oppose or support same-sex marriage. BUt in light of RFMA, I don't think that narrow scope suffices anymore. I also oppose the expansion of our use of the term "marriage equality" because we've already been down that road with [[pro-life]] and [[pro-choice]] and the overwhelming consensus is to use neither term due to its political implications.

RFC question: How should the political issue of "marriage" be framed in political articles?
#Continue to frame marriage issues, and section headings, in terms of opposition/support for [[same-sex marriage]]?
#Refer neutrally to "Marriage" in section headings, and address nuances in prose?
#Turn to a duality of "traditional marriage" vs. "marriage equality" framing?
#None of the above: but avoid ideologically-framed terms in favor of something else?

Which version should be used? 

'''Option 1:''' In 2009, Chou moved to Las Vegas and became a landlord with his wife. According to Balmore Orellana, a former tenant and neighbor of Chou, he was a considerate landlord as Chou did not raise his rent throughout the time that he lived there, but was verbally aggressive toward his wife as he would hear Chou yelling through the walls. In the wake of the shooting Orellana also recalled Chou telling him that he identified as Chinese despite his Taiwanese nationality, and believed that China and Taiwan were one country. In the mid 2010s Chou was almost beaten to death by two tenants who were in arrears; Orellana said the attack left him with scars all over his body and was a harbinger of the decline in his mental stability.

'''Option 2:''' According to his former neighbor, Chou was once a friendly owner of a Las Vegas apartment building. In 2012 he suffered a nearly fatal attack by two tenants over rent that led to a loss of consciousness, a broken skull, elbow, and partial hearing loss.

''Advantages''
* Establishes list criteria without introducing any new vocabularly to enter the WikiLawyer lexicon. 
* Uses [[Template:List criteria]] to document the consensus
* This proposal is formatted in expectation we will be asking an uninvolved ed to determine consensus and do non-admin closure.

See "[[Wikipedia_talk:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Making_ANI_less_toxic|Making ANI less toxic]]". Many comparisons have been made between [[WP:ANI]] and [[WP:AE]], mostly favorably alluding to the latter being more civil and less liable to veer off into unrelated discussion, dispute, and general mayhem. One difference between these two is that AE has prescribed sections for each user. What if ANI had this?

; Options

* '''A''': ''ANI posts must be split up into sub-sections, with each user (including admins) replying only in their section "<u>Statement by (username)</u>.''"
* '''B''': ''ANI posts must be split up into sub-sections, with each "non-admin user" replying only in their prescribed section "<u>Statement by (username)</u>". Admin users comment in an "<u>Administrator discussion</u>" section at the bottom.''
* '''C''': ''ANI posts must be split up into sub-sections, with each "involved user" replying only in their section "<u>Statement by (username) (involved)</u>". Uninvolved users may then comment in an overall "<u>Uninvolved discussion</u>" section at the bottom. Admin users may then comment in an overall "<u>Administrator discussion</u>" section below that.''
* '''D''': ''Status quo, without any delineation by user.''
* '''E''': ''Two sections: "<u>Involved discussion</u>" and "<u>Uninvolved discussion</u>"''

It should be said that all of the above (A {{Emdash}} C) would still allow for proposals to be placed as separate subsections, such as "'''Topic ban proposal'''" but that such sections should have a '''Survey''' and '''Discussion'''.

{{rfcquote|text=
The situation. On March 1st the governing bodies of tennis (ATP,WTA,ITF) told the world that no Russian or Belarus player can play a tennis tournament under their nation's flag because of the attack on Ukraine by Russian forces. All tournaments agreed and since that time you will see no player nationality listed at any tournament. No problems there. However, authorities did not say they would remove all nationality from rankings, nor did it say that we should erase the nationality of a player for other reasons. The ATP website software seems to have a problem in that it removed all traces of nationality of Russian/Belarus players... everything. [https://www.atptour.com/en/players/daniil-medvedev/mm58/overview Daniil Medvedev's bio shows no trace of his Russian flag]. Rankings [https://www.atptour.com/en/rankings/singles?rankRange=0-100&rankDate=2020-12-28 from 2020 also show no nationality]. This is a software error and makes missing nationality from rankings on the ATP and WTA unreliable at the moment.

If we use other sources for rankings we see a different picture. [https://www.espn.com/tennis/rankings ESPN rankings], [https://www.foxsports.com/tennis/atp/rankings FOX rankings], [http://stats.washingtonpost.com/tennis/rankings.asp?tour=ATP Washington Post rankings], [https://tennisabstract.com/reports/atpRankings.html Tennis Abstract rankings]... these all show a nationality... as they should. Individual tournaments, which we can source, are a different matter. Nationality is not allowed for the tournaments and those affected players are not allowed to enter team events.

These ranking templates will be affected:
*[[Template:Current ATP singles rankings]]
*[[Template:Current WTA singles rankings]]
*[[Template:Current WTA doubles individual rankings]]
*[[Template:Current ATP doubles individual rankings]]

Joint governing body March 1st statement [https://www.atptour.com/en/news/joint-statement-by-the-international-governing-bodies-of-tennis-1-march-2022 is right here]

These templates are used in multiple articles and inside other templates, and readers have complained about missing nationalities where I have no good answer for them. Since I see no large discussion of this, and another editor and I are at a complete impasse, I have started this RfC here (since it affects multiple tennis articles).

{{rfcquote|text=
This article's original name was "2023 Nigerian general election" but it was changed to "2023 Nigerian elections" due to the addition of elections not on a single election day. The name was changed back a few months later leading to a requested move in April which ended in no responses, a second requested move in June also ended in no responses before being reopened later that month and again ending in no responses. A few more discussions on various talk pages also went nowhere. The dispute is between one side (me) who supports a move as the current title indicates that there is one central election on one day; however, there are dozens of different elections in Nigeria throughout 2023 (from February to at least November) making this page comparable to the [[2020 United States elections]] page. The other side ({{user|Number 57}}) argues for the page to be split.
*To correct the false claim above, the two RMs did not receive no responses. Both received responses and ended in no consensus outcomes. The false claim is on top of an attempt earlier to get the page moved by falsely claiming it was a non-controversial move at [[WP:RM/T]], The forum shopping and behavioural issues around this are getting increasingly concerning.

Should any article written by Sydney Zatz on Royal Central be depreciated? The reason why I ask was because I found [https://royalcentral.co.uk/uk/milestones-of-a-monarch-the-rhodesia-crisis-176036/ this article by the author] on Royal Central which appeared to have directly copied a paragraph from our [[Queen of Rhodesia]] article. When I [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_379#Royal_Central%2C_deprecate%3F raised the initial discussion at RSN], {{ping|user:Mhawk10}} made the point that [[WP:EARWIG]] shows that a number of her other articles also seem to copy from Wikipedia without attribution ([https://copyvios.toolforge.org/?lang=en&project=wikipedia&title=&oldid=1082459436&use_engine=0&use_links=0&turnitin=0&action=compare&url=https%3A%2F%2Froyalcentral.co.uk%2Fuk%2Fthe-history-of-royal-maundy-services-175127%2F example here but rest on RSN link]). I sent an email through Royal Central's "Contact Us" page telling them of it about a month ago and had no reply and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Royal_Central_(cont.) little advice from RSN on followup].

We are having some issues with interpretations of what the Authors said and what an editor interprete. I assumed good faith in the editor since she/he is a senior editor but not a single source discusses "Boro Identity Formation". Authors discuss socio-religious and political transformation or aspirations of the community. Based on {{tq|"From the colonial period, the Bodos have been defining themselves as a community in opposition to other communities. The Bodo-educated elites and intelligentsia have been articulating their divergence from the Assamese caste Hindu society and highlighting issues like land alienation and social and economic backwardness."}}, The editor interpreted the "Boro Identity Formation" began in the colonial period. To my understanding, Neither her/his interpretation is correct nor the section name is WP:DUE. Should there be some changes? I will appreciate your comments.

I suggest the following amendment to [[Wikipedia:Username_policy#Real_names|the real names section]]: {{tq|<u>You are strongly discouraged from using your real name, a nickname, or any other username which might be traced to you.</u> <s>Consider carefully before creating an account in your real name or a nickname which might be traced to you, as these increase</s> <u>Using your real name</u> increases the potential for harassment, especially if you edit in controversial subject areas. <u>Consider your personal safety too. In some countries, editing Wikipedia can be illegal, and using your real name can put you at risk of legal consequences.</u> While it is possible to rename your account later (see Changing your username below), a record of your previous username remains permanently.}}

It is high time that our guidance on real usernames be stronger. While I understand that many users wish they had used their real name initially, you can always change your username to your real name later. But you can never scrub your real name from Wikipedia once you've used it. Further, using one's real name is I believe an example of western privilege that a good swath of our other editors do not have. But even our western editors are exposed to considerable harassment. Nor are such users immune from legal trouble. Take [[Rémi Mathis]], who used his real name, and got in trouble with the French. Our contributors are in increasing real world danger from using their real names. Our lukewarm guidance is no longer sufficient.

In order to avoid possible confusion, I also propose to say that the left-stage inveter (which is B-driven) circuit is not acting exactly like a NOT gate.

The purpose of this '''[[Wikipedia:Requests for comment|request for comment]]''' is to provide an opportunity to amend the structure, rules, and procedures of the '''[[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2022|December 2022 English Wikipedia Arbitration Committee election]]''' and resolve any issues not covered by the [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Arbitration Committee Elections/ACERFC decisions to date|'''existing rules''']]. 13:49, 1 September 2022‎ (UTC)

'''Background''': In the case of proposals that change existing rules, or that seek to establish new ones, lack of consensus for a change will result in the rules from the 2020 election remaining in force. Some issues are not covered by the existing rules but will need to be decided one way or another for the operation of the election, in those cases it will be up to the closer to figure out a result, even if there is no clear consensus, as they have had to in the past.

'''Structure''': This RfC is divided into portions, each of which contains a discussion point for the community. The standard RfC structure will be used, in which any user may make a general statement that other users may endorse if they so agree. The points will be listed in the [[#toc|table of contents]] below, along with the users who have made statements. Anyone is free to raise any new topics that they feel need to be addressed by filling out the [[#Formatting|format template below]] or using {{tls|ACERFC statement}}.

'''Duration''':  In order to preserve the timeline of the election (see above), we should aim to close this RfC as soon as 30 days have passed, i.e. '''on or after 23:59, {{#time:d F Y|{{Arbitration Committee candidate/data|2022|rfcend}}-1 day}} (UTC)'''. The results will determine the structure, rules, and procedures for the election.

'''Timeline''': Per the consensus developed in previous requests for comment, the electoral commission timetable is as follows:

*Nominations: {{#time:l 00:00, d F Y|{{Arbitration Committee candidate/data|2022|ecbegin}}}} until {{#time:l 23:59, d F Y|{{Arbitration Committee candidate/data|2022|ecnomclose}}-1 day}} (UTC)
*Evaluation period: {{#time:l 00:00, d F Y|{{Arbitration Committee candidate/data|2022|ecnomclose}}}} until {{#time:l 23:59, d F Y|{{Arbitration Committee candidate/data|2022|ecend}}-1 day}} (UTC)
*Commission selection: completed by {{#time:l 00:00, d F Y|{{Arbitration Committee candidate/data|2022|ecdeadline}}}} (UTC)

Per the consensus developed in previous request for comments, the arbitration committee election timetable is as follows:

*Nominations: {{#time:l 00:00, d F Y|{{Arbitration Committee candidate/data|2022|nombegin}}}} until {{#time:l 23:59, d F Y|{{Arbitration Committee candidate/data|2022|nomend}}-1 day}} (UTC)
*Setup period: {{#time:l 00:00, d F Y|{{Arbitration Committee candidate/data|2022|nomend}}}} to {{#time:l 23:59, d F Y|{{Arbitration Committee candidate/data|2022|begin}}-2 day}} (UTC)
*Voting period: {{#time:l 00:00, d F Y|{{Arbitration Committee candidate/data|2022|begin}}}} until {{#time:l 23:59, d F Y|{{Arbitration Committee candidate/data|2022|end}}-1day}} (UTC)
*Scrutineering: begins {{#time:l 00:00, d F Y|{{Arbitration Committee candidate/data|2022|end}}}} (UTC)

''' Proposal 1: Shorten nomination period to 7 days '''

Reduce the length of the nomination period to 7 days, instead of 10 days. 

Since the dates of the nomination period are known far in advance, potential candidates have ample time to prepare their statements ahead of time. Thus a lengthy nomination period isn't needed. This will reduce the amount of time that the community will engage in speculation on the number of eventual candidates.

Hi!

In a 2019 interview [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ellK-CXh7B4&ab_channel=GoodMorningAmerica] (it happens at 2:01) Taylor Swift stated "Starting November 2020 I can re-record albums one through five all over again" in reference to [[Taylor Swift|her masters controversy]]. [[User:Ippantekina]] and [[User:Binksternet]] both feel this is not an adequate source to add the recording date of "November 2020–" to the re-recorded songs.

[[User:Ippantekina]] disagrees because she does not explicitly mention ''Fearless'' or ''Red'' [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Begin_Again_(Taylor_Swift_song)&diff=prev&oldid=1102424478&diffmode=source], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ippantekina#Taylor_re-recordings]. I disagree with this disagreement because she mentions her first five albums, which ''Fearless'' and ''Red'' fall under.

Despite [[User:Binksternet]] agreeing with me that she did not re-record these songs before November 2020 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Binksternet#??], they feel this is an example of [[WP:SYNTH]] because Taylor does not explicitly state every song in question. I believe this is an example of [[WP:NOTJUSTANYSYNTH]] because saying "album" is enough to imply the songs on the album.

Please watch the interview for yourself and come to your own conclusion on whether or not the songs' infoboxes should reflect having not been recorded prior to November 2020.

Thank you for taking the time. [[User:Tree Critter|Tree Critter]] ([[User talk:Tree Critter|talk]]) 22:26, 6 August 2022 (UTC)}}

'''Background''': A [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Biology/Archive_4#Consensus_how_scientific_names_are_displayed_in_the_lead_of_species_articles_listed_under_common_names|discussion was held in June–July 2011]] that ended with a declaration of a consensus that stated, in part, that in an article about an organism, if the scientific name of the organism is not the title of the article, the scientific name should {{em|not}} be presented in boldface in the opening sentence{{snd}} i.e. that only italics should be used (ordinarily inside of parentheses). As far as I am aware, that consensus has not been formally overturned, and indeed many articles about organisms on Wikipedia do not use boldfacing for the scientific name of the organism. See, for example, the current versions of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timber_rattlesnake&oldid=1103846852 Timber rattlesnake] article and the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wild_turkey&oldid=1104936823 Wild turkey] article. Some articles do not even use boldface for the scientific name when it {{em|is}} the title of the article{{snd}} e.g. see the current version of the ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crotalus_cerastes&oldid=1103869585 Crotalus cerastes]'' article. The general Wikipedia guideline about the boldfacing of topic names can be found at [[MOS:BOLD]] and [[MOS:BOLDSYN]], which say that boldfacing should be used for the topic name {{em|and for significant alternative names}} that redirect to the article, which appears to differ from that July 2011 conclusion. This question was recently discussed further at [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (fauna)#Boldface for common vs. scientific names]], wherein several editors suggested that the scientific name, since it is always one of the significant alternative names by which an organism is known and is practically always the name of a redirect when it is not the title of the article, should {{em|always}} be boldfaced when it is introduced.

'''The question''': In an article about an organism, should the scientific name of the organism {{em|always}} be presented in boldface (as well as italics) when it is introduced?

I'm debating whether to propose a merger between the [[Exxon]] article and the [[ExxonMobil]] article. The article here is a bit short, and a majority of its content could be merged into [[ExxonMobil]] and/or a new article on the histories of both Exxon and Mobil before and after the 1999 merger (these two companies are the biggest direct descendants of Standard Oil save for Chevron).<br/>
There's a few big reasons why I'm thinking of a merger: <br/>
1. ExxonMobil is commonly referred to as Exxon, most likely because Exxon is first in the merged company's name<br/>
2. The merger didn't create a completely new company; ExxonMobil is in essence a merged continuation of Exxon<br/>
3. ExxonMobil already contains a lot of history on Exxon prior to the merger, including but not limited to the Valdez.<br/>
4. The merger was similar to the [[Merger of Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile US]], except that both brands survived.<br/>
I don't feel ready to propose the merger just yet, but rather survey editors on whether it should/could be done first. [[User:InvadingInvader|InvadingInvader]] ([[User talk:InvadingInvader|talk]]) 01:33, 8 September 2022 (UTC)}}

Recently there was controversy over what map or other image, if any, should be placed in the article's lead, eventually an RfC was held, with the conclusion that there was consensus against the proposed maps due to concerns over original research, but given that the only users who took part in it were ones who were already involved in the dispute, I thought it was appropriate to at least have further discussion on this issue.

I made some proposals which were already mentioned above:

# The world map based on The Man in the High Castle, which was recently removed: [[c:File:The Man in the High Castle Plausible World Map.png]]
# A world map based on Fatherland: [[c:File:Fatherland.png]]
# Another map based on Fatherland, but this time of Europe only, this was the one originally in the lead: [[c:File:Fatherland's 1964 Europe.jpg]]
# A model of the Volkshalle, which was to be built if Germany won: [[c:File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1986-029-02, "Germania", Modell "Große Halle".jpg]]
# A broader model of "Germania", the planned rebuilding of Berlin: [[c:File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146III-373, Modell der Neugestaltung Berlins ("Germania").jpg]]

How should this article define the age range of ''shōnen'' manga?

*An impasse has emerged on this article  over defining the age range of ''shōnen '' manga, which can be reviewed in the discussion immediately above this RfC. ''A Brief History of Manga'' by [[Helen McCarthy]] defines the age range as 9 to 18, while ''Understanding Manga and Anime'' by Robin E. Brenner defines it at 12 to 18. The other sources provided by [[User:SG1994!]] supporting the 12-18 range are, in my view, plainly unreliable blogs. I propose that "''Shōnen'' manga" under "Terminology and etymology" be revised to the following: {{tq|''Shōnen'' manga refers to manga aimed at an audience of adolescent boys, with the primary target audience alternately defined as widely as 9 to 18 years old [McCarthy cite] and as narrowly as 12 to 18 years old.

I've noticed in a few "Titles & Styles" sections of bios, that there's at times inconsistencies on the dates. Most recently disputes have occurred at [[William, Prince of Wales]] & [[Prince George of Wales]], for example. So, how do we handle this? I think Prince William's bio would be a good focal point, given the multiple changes he's went through on September 8 & 9, 2022. 

Do we use ''end dates'' for titles, when a 'higher' title has been proclaimed? or do we continue to show the lower titles as continuing to be used? <br>

I’d like to recommend that the basketball guideline add a numbered statement (in the first position) under “Significant coverage is likely to exist for basketball figures if they:”

* Played at least one game in the National Basketball Association (NBA), existing 1946-present 

Work was done several months back source to GNG players who appeared in exactly one game (discussion [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject National Basketball Association/Archive 43#Intermediate break|here]], list [[User:Alvaldi/sandbox/NBA players with one game|here]]). Overwhelmingly it appears NBA players get significant coverage either through their NBA careers or college or other leagues.

Hi. I only come across this issue when I saw a discussion on the Talk page of [[Southend-on-Sea]] regarding the [[County Borough of Southend-on-Sea]] page. I raised this as an AFD, which basically has had little input other from myself and [[User talk:Crouch, Swale]], and then as a discussion on the [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Geography]], placing notices of the discussion on both the notability page for geography and the  [[WikiProject:Councils]] talk page. So far there has only been two people involved - guess who! 

As Wikipedia is a community and is governed by concensus, I have raised this AFD to bring clarity, as there seems to be no actual rules just opinion.

The first issue is the Metropolitan and Non metropolitan districts of England: What is their correct name? As evidenced from different sources the names are different: Take [[City of Chelmsford]], the Ordnance survey [https://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/doc/7000000000038907 district] says City of Chelmsford, the Office for National Statistics  [https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/documents/ons::local-authority-districts-counties-and-unitary-authorities-april-2021-map-in-united-kingdom-/about] says Chelmsford, GOV.uk (which lists them as Councils although the download page states it is metropolitan and non metropolitan districts) [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1026384/List_of_councils_in_England_2021.pdf] as Chelmsford City Council,  the Council tax: stock of properties, 2018 on gov.uk "Table CTSOP1.0: Number of properties by Council Tax band and region, county and local authority district" which comes from the Valuation Office Agency [https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/council-tax-stock-of-properties-2018] says Chelmsford, or the Ministry of Housing,
Communities & Local Government Open data portal [https://opendatacommunities.org/atlas/resource?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fopendatacommunities.org%2Fid%2Fgeography%2Fadministration%2Fgb%2FK03000001] says Chelmsford. When you look at Southend-on-Sea, the name fluctuates between Southend-on-Sea and Southend-on-Sea Unitary Authority!

As the UK government seem to have an issue to what the naming conventions should be should we:

1. Go with current naming convention, based on Ordance Survey.
2. Go with the Ministry Ministry of Housing,
Communities & Local Government Open data portal.

Second Issue. Do we need to have separate pages for the local authority district and the local authority council? Or could these be combined ?

1. Keep separate pages for both district and council.
2. Merge pages together and name under a. The district or b. The council.

Initially, there was her name in Kurdish. An editor removed it insisting that it was not a necessity.

'Titles and Styles' is a section in the articles of many royal figures, including British ones. Most include a bulleted list of titles and styles with a date range showing when the titles and styles were used. There are inconsistencies with these date ranges. For example, recent versions of this article have used:

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William,_Prince_of_Wales&oldid=1110667639#Styles,_titles,_honours,_and_arms 8 September 2022 – present: His Royal Highness The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge]

and

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William,_Prince_of_Wales&oldid=1110701241#Styles,_titles,_honours,_and_arms 8 – 9 September: His Royal Highness The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge]

I believe the root of the issue is that titles and styles are different things with incompatible dating conventions. 

I would appreciate '''comment on how the 'Titles and Styles' section of this article should be formatted or changed.''' Thank you.

''Note'': a similar RfC has been made at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Royalty and Nobility#RFC: Titles & Styles|Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Royalty and Nobility#RFC: Titles & Styles]] by @[[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]].

{{rfcquote|text=
[[WP:CAT#T]] states "Templates are not articles, and thus do not belong in ''content categories''." While templates are certainly not articles, they often contain content, in some cases content that appears in no other place on Wikipedia, e.g. [[Template:1933 Southeastern Conference football standings]]. From a practical standpoint, it may useful to navigate directly from a content category like [[:Category:Southeastern Conference football]] to a category like [[:Category:Southeastern Conference football templates]] and its subcats like [[:Category:Southeastern Conference football standings templates]], which contain templates related the subject of Southeastern Conference football. After all, the point of categories is to organize things by batching related things together and helping users find them, right?

In late 2020, we had a discussion on this talk page concerning this issue; see [[Wikipedia talk:Categorization/Archive 18#procedure makes the category tree worse, both coming and going]]. Participants included {{u|Tahc}}, {{u|Dr Greg}}, {{u|Michael Bednarek}}, {{u|andrybak}}, {{u|Oculi}}, {{u|Fayenatic london}}, {{u|DexDor}}, and me. We had substantial support there for changing the existing policy. What does the wider community think? Should we change this policy?

There have recently been a lot of problems in the Balkan topic area regarding the use of Albanian author Pellumb Xhufi. While ostensibly an academic, he has been repeatedly criticized for "virulently Anti-Greek positions" [https://books.google.com/books?id=8f0OEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA65&dq=xhufi+albanian&hl=el&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi38I23_ur5AhXCM1kFHWcCAiYQ6AF6BAgGEAI#v=snippet&q=%22himself%20an%20active%20politician%20who%20has%20served%22&f=false] and nationalism by various scholars [https://iog.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/i_iog/ueber_uns/personen_dokumente/Schmitt_Onlinepublikationen/Regionenband.pdf] (search for "nationalistischer Ton (Pëllumb Xhufi"). While publications in peer reviewed journals are considered reliable no matter the author, problems arise regarding the use of works by Xhufi that are published by publishers of unknown reliability and journals for which the level of peer-review is unclear. The issue has been festering for a while, and even though I've already posted twice here regarding this author, nothing conclusive was decided. I think the best way to resolve the question is via RfC with the following options.

'''Option 1. Publications by Xhufi not in international peer-reviewed journals should not used at all on Wikipedia.'''

'''Option 2. Publications by Xhufi not in international peer-reviewed journals should only be used to source non-controversial claims and facts.'''

'''Option 3. Publications by Xhufi not in international peer-reviewed journals can only be used to source controversial claims and facts with attribution ("According to P. Xhufi...). Non-controversial claims and facts do not need attribution.'''

'''Option 4. Publications by Xhufi not in international peer-reviewed journals can be used without attribution.'''

Please note again that the above applies only to publications by Xhufi not in international peer-reviewed journals. "Controversial" would be anything that is typically controversial (e.g. ethnicity, demographics), especially in relation to other sources. In order to achieve meaningful consensus it would be nice to have buy in from as many non-Balkan editors as possible.

Should the tables with the combined regular season and playoff statistics be deleted?

This keeps happening on a number of pages (primarily on statistics in which Tom Brady would be on the top of the leaderboard).  See:

* [[List of National Football League career passing completions leaders#Most completions and attempts, including playoff games]]
* [[List of National Football League career passing touchdowns leaders#Most career touchdown passes including playoff games]]
* [[List of National Football League career passing yards leaders#Players with the most career passing yards including playoff games]]

There may be other articles with the same problem.  The NFL does not combine regular season and post-season statistics.  See, for example, page 622 of the 2022 Official National Football League Record & Fact Book (PDF found here: https://operations.nfl.com/updates/the-game/2022-nfl-record-and-fact-book/).  Combining the statistics constitutes original research.  I am opening this discussion to talk about the removal of combined regular season and post-season stats from all articles within the scope of the NFL WikiProject.

I have attempted to find any consensus or discussion of the guidance listed at the top of the category, which says "Book articles should appear in subcategories for the publishers of their first or simultaneous editions including paperback originals, their major revised editions, and their translations — not for the publishers of reprints or reissues that differ by minor revisions or by nationality. Books with simultaneous publication in various countries may be listed with each publisher." I couldn't find any, but the criteria was first introduced with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Books_by_publisher&oldid=413796252 this edit].

Recently, I have been looking through Wikipedia's lists of instrumental repertoire and have found that some do not comply with the project's guidelines. As such, I have either merged the article to its parent page or started an AfD discussion depending on what I best felt was needed for the article. However, per [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Flute repertoire]], some editors thought it'd be best to start a wider discussion on how to move forward with these lists.

So how should lists of instrumental repertoire be treated on Wikipedia?
*'''Option 1''': No lists of repertoire 
*'''Option 2''': Lists of notable repertoire based on sources and the existence of Wikipedia pages
*'''Option 3''': Lists of compositions that try to include every piece for that instrument

{{rfcquote|text=
As the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ceres_(dwarf_planet)#ENGVAR discussion above illustrated], there are reasonable reasons for using either English variant in the article. It appears to have started in American English (semimajor rather than semi-major), when more than a stub it may have been both American and British English (hard to tell), and when first nominated as a good article it looks to be a mix (colour but neighborhood) with American dates. When it made "good article" it was still a mix of usage and dates. When it made featured article it was still a mixture of styles plus it had American dates. It went through years of demotions. In 2021 it was relisted as a good article... American English but British dates. That has stayed ever since, until yesterday. Having both styles in one article is messy for an encyclopedia so we should settle on one type and use it throughout. Yesterday someone changed it all to British English and today someone added the template "British English Only." This is a level 4 vital article and a former featured article; current and past good article. There should be consensus before adding such a permanent template to this article so I'm attempting it here.

#Inserting a team's category for whom he only played at youth level (what we currently do)

{{rfcquote|text=
Many articles related to British royalty (and possiby others) contain a section on their titles and styles, for example those at [[Charles III#Titles, styles, honours and arms|Charles III]], [[Anne, Princess Royal#Titles, styles, honours and arms|Anne, Princess Royal]], and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother#Titles, styles, honours and arms|Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]]. Within them titles and styles are usually presented in a single subsection, with a bulleted list of titles and styles and the dates when they were used.

An [[Talk:William, Prince of Wales#RfC on Titles and Styles|RfC recently occured at William, Prince of Wales]] about how to organise these sections. The broad consensus was that titles and styles are different things and should therefore not be combined into a single subsection, as this is confusing.

'''I am requesting comment on whether 'Titles and Styles' sections should contain separate 'Titles' and 'Styles' subsections, and any other relevant comments on how these sections might be organised.'''

Since 2011, it has been [[:File:Red Pencil Icon.png]] at 16px ([[File:Red Pencil Icon.png]]). For examples, clicking the icon in the infobox at [[Acacia pycnantha]] leads to [[Template:Taxonomy/Acacia]]. It appears on more than 300,000 pages.

But as a geneticist explains in “Pit Bull,” the likelihood that a dog bred for the worst behavior imaginable could somehow pass on its unique genetic heritage without it being diluted is “absolutely ludicrous.” Besides, dog aggression, as Dickey points out, is largely considered to be influenced most by a dog’s early development, and how it’s been socialized with other dogs and humans. ~Kelly Lauerman<ref name="Lauerman 2016">{{cite web | last=Lauerman | first=Kerry | title=It’s time to stop demonizing pit bulls | website=Washington Post | date=2016-05-20 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2016/05/20/pit-bull-rescue-mission-restoring-a-bad-dogs-good-name/ | access-date=2022-09-13}}</ref>

'''Seeking resolve''' to a dispute on '''whether the opening lead paragraph should have any sort of reference to republican/abolition discourse/reactions based on the weight of content (reactions to the death) in the article'''. This RfC is '''primarily about whether there should be any mention of it in the first place or none at all by determing the weight of the article's content'''. Though specific wording might be suggested in proposed revisions as a by–product of the discussion process, '''this RfC is ''not'' primarily about selecting a revision on its specific wording''' but about if the '''wider discourse that it relates to the paragraph''' should be mentioned in any type of wording at all. As a starting point, if you wish to see an example revision of an opening lead paragraph with some sort of mention to these concepts, see this [[Special:Permalink/1110693943|old edit]]. If you wish to see an example revision of an opening lead with no mention at all to these concepts, see [[Special:Permalink/1110804144|the article's current revision]]. In summary, '''yes or no''' – no maintains the current paragraph as it exist now, yes means there is a change to include some sort of summary mentioning this discourse/reactions in the opening lead paragraph (how and what comes afterwards if we cross that bridge).

{{rfcquote|text=
Please comment on whether shall we add the two different facts mentioned in [[Guinness World Records]] as well as [[Encyclopedia Britannica]] or add either only one! 
The origin of polo is said to be "Persia (Iran)" by [[Encyclopedia Britannica]] but the [[Guinness World Records]] says the origin of polo is "Manipur". 
The [[Guinness World Records]] clarified the record of the origin of polo as [[Manipur]] in its 1991 edition, from its former record, [[Persia]] mentioned in 1984 edition.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Italian seal on Manipur polo origin - Milan-based writer to visit Imphal to collect material for book on game's history|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/italian-seal-on-manipur-polo-origin-milan-based-writer-to-visit-imphal-to-collect-material-for-book-on-game-s-history/cid/791135|access-date=2022-09-17|website=www.telegraphindia.com}}</ref> 
In the 1991 edition of Guinness World Records, it states {{quote|Polo can be traced to origins in Manipur state c. 3100 B.C., when it was played as Sagol Kangjei. Other claims are of it being of Persian origin, having been played as pulu c. 525 B.C.<ref>{{Cite book |last=McFarlan |first=Donald |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=yPfPrgK21okC&q=1991+manipur+Guinness+Book+of+Records&dq=1991+manipur+Guinness+Book+of+Records&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&source=gb_mobile_search&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiK6o2HwJ76AhU06jgGHdi5ClsQ6AF6BAgCEAM#1991%20manipur |title=Guinness Book of World Records 1991 |last2=McWhirter |first2=Norris |publisher=Bantam Books |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-553-28954-1 |pages=288 |language=en |quote=Polo can be traced to origins in Manipur state c. 3100 B.C., when it was played as Sagol Kangjei.}}</ref>}}

At the same time, Encyclopedia Britannica says {{quote|polo was first played in Persia (Iran) at dates given from the 6th century BC to the 1st century AD.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/polo | title=Polo &#124; sport &#124; Britannica}}</ref>}} 
I respect both the sources and I want both information to be added in the article citing their sources properly. The problem is one editor challenges the authenticity of Guinness World Records, first saying it's not said by Guinness, and later claiming that even though Guinness mentioned it, the fact is not possible. --[[User:Haoreima|Haoreima]] ([[User talk:Haoreima|talk]]) 09:12, 20 September 2022 (UTC)}}

'''Option 3''' Something else?

{{rfcquote|text=
Should the Basque spelling of Elcano's name be rendered in bold in the opening sentence? There is a dispute over this, with one editor maintaining that [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Juan_Sebasti%C3%A1n_Elcano&diff=1111422257&oldid=1111395451 "it's distracting].

I note that [[Elkano]] indeed redirects to our article; the only point of contention I see here is about "significant". Editors are asked to be '''concise'''.

{{rfcquote|text=
I'm about to create a stub draft article about SRG SSR's historical TV channel that was known as Schweiz 4 in German, Suisse 4 in French, Svizzera 4 in Italian, and Svizra 4 in Romansh. But I can't decide which should be the article's title. Given the multilingual nature of the channel, I don't think either language should dominate. But what can I do?

# [[Schweiz – Suisse – Svizzera – Svizra 4]]
# [[Schweiz 4 – Suisse 4 – Svizzera 4 – Svizra 4]]
# [[Schweiz 4]] (German name), with [[Suisse 4]], [[Svizzera 4]] and [[Svizra 4]] as redirects

Should the "licensee" and "network_en" parameters from {{t|Infobox animanga/Video}} be removed? 
*Proposing this for {{t|Infobox animanga/Video}}, and coming here after the successful implementation of [[Template talk:Infobox television channel#RfC for removal of "Availability" section]].

:This template lists the English licensees of anime (television and film). Considering that this is a subcategory of the broader television and films, none of whose templates ({{t|Infobox television}} and {{t|Infobox film}}) specifically list English "licensees" or "networks", this exception for anime is incongruous and aberrant with the rest of the enwiki. The information contained herein appears mostly unencyclopedic per [[WP:NOTDIRECTORY]] and [[WP:NOTINDISCRIMINATE]] and from what I have seen serves no useful purpose but to clutter articles.

:Any notable case of release by licensed broadcasters/film distributors can be noted in the article body (if relevant), as is the case for other films and television.

{{rfcquote|text=
Unfortunately disagreements above have led to the necessity of another RFC.

This disagreement is over the interpretation of previous RFC and whether or not Barbados should be included next to Elizabeth II, or whether all 32 states should be included (and how to display that), I've taken GoodDay's advice and moved it to RFC.

Even though this RFC is clearly going to only impact Elizabeth's unique reign, I've made it a generic RFC because I believe that's the best way to avoid interpretation issues down the road.

'''Current state'''

Currently, based on [[Talk:List of longest-reigning monarchs/Archive 5#Request for comment on Elizabeth duality|this previous RFC]], 15 states were selected to be added next to Elizabeth under the reasoning "Jamaica and other sovereign nations with Elizabeth as head of state be all listed together".

As such, 17 states were excluded based on the fact that they were no longer under Elizabeth's rule.

Additionally, above the first table you'll notice the sentence "Twenty-five longest-reigning monarchs of states that were internationally recognized as sovereign for most or all of their reign."

Interpretation of this sentence has been up for debate, but in my opinion, it would exclude 16 of those excluded states (All except Barbados), because all were under Elizabeth's reign for a minority/less than half of her reign.

'''RFC scope'''

Can we therefore have a discussion (Read: Not a vote, at least not yet) on when and how to include a state or states for a Monarch during their reign.

Do we abolish the "most or all" part, and just include any state that was sovereign during their reign? Do we adjust that to say only states that were sovereign for the entirety of their reign? Or states that were still under their rule at the end of that reign? (These aren't choices, just examples of discussion).

Note, this is a request for ''comment'', not a request for votes, it's not up to me to limit your options, and I believe previous attempts to limit votes to specific options have resulted in subsequent RFCs. If you have a particular view of how it should be, please explain the merits of that view, so that we can build consensus.

If no consensus is formed, we'll take it to a vote and ping those who have commented to come and discuss. [[User:Supertrinko|El Dubs]] ([[User talk:Supertrinko|talk]]) 02:09, 23 September 2022 (UTC)}}

Based on the introductory and the fact that the lead should identify the topic and summarize the body of the article with appropriate weight, do you '''support''', '''oppose''', or '''oppose partially''' the removal of political activist and/or comedian from the lede and occupation infobox of this article?

As I've concluded after previous discussions pertaining to what makes a subject a notable comedian, many editors agree that:
* Appearing in comedy films and being a comedian is not the same thing
* The usual criteria for being a comedian includes at minimum a period of having done stand-up, or as a stretch, regularly appearing cast members of any sketch comedy show.

He simply isn't notable for being a political activist, I don't think any further argument needs to be made regarding this.

I recently made an edit as I created List of Danger Force characters and it imminently got reverted back to a redirect. There was no discussion when the list of Henry Danger characters page when it was created. I did ask about putting the info on the Henry Danger character page and no one responded so I went ahead and just made the page for the Danger Force characters. I was going by the issues from my last reverts when splitting articles for Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon pages and was told that do not remove content and subsequently create redirects without prior talk page consensus, and if there is consensus, cite a link to the discussion proving it. Since the Henry Danger character page didn't have a discussion and this show uses many of the same characters it should of been okay and justified to create the split without discussing.

{{rfcquote|text=
I’d like to raise consideration on whether this page should be deleted (due to lack of notability) or if it simply needs major revisions (due to current lack of non-promotional references). It is my belief that this website exists solely for the purpose of promoting Mr. Wheaton. I am a casual Wikipedia editor, so I don’t know the best path forward.


Looking back into the history of the page, the page was created in 2013 by @[[User:Wikifan115|Wikifan115]]. Later that year, wikifan115 was issued a temporary ban due to suspected paid editing (and apparently an admin had proof of a fiverr account at that time). I don’t have any proof as it relates to this specific article, but I find it a bit intriguing. 


The next phase of this page had a significant number of edits by @[[User:Ephemeralcas|Ephemeralcas]]. This user’s history seems to center around Mr. Wheaton’s life with edits to this page, terminal-emulators, wood-burning stoves, and creating the page for “ [[Ernie and Erica Wisner]] ‎” which is linked from this page. This user also added Mr. Wheaton to the page  [[List of people from Missoula, Montana]], listing Mr. Wheaton as the “Duke of Permaculture.”


The next phase of this page had a series of edits from anonymous users.


The following phase has a series of edits from @[[User:EmilyTheEditor|EmilyTheEditor]]. This editor’s entire history revolves around Mr. Wheaton.


The next major segment of edits comes from @[[User:Datapass|Datapass]]. I don’t have anything special to say about this user or their edits.


Finally we get to current time with recent edits all being made by @[[User:GamgeeGardner|GamgeeGardner]]. This is once again a user who’s only contributions have been to Mr. Wheaton’s page. The first edit made by GamgeeGardner was reverted by @[[User:Serols|Serols]] for “Advertising/promotion.” GamgeeGardner re-did that edit nearly identically and that text (and Amazon link) still exists on the page today.


There are claims made on the article I don’t know are backed up with proper sources. For example: “ As a software engineer, he has worked on the ground system for the [[satellite]] that took pictures for [[Google Earth]] and [[DigitalGlobe]].” This statement is followed up by two sources. One of the sources is Mr. Wheaton’s own website. The second is a local newspaper from Mr. Wheaton’s hometown about him, which I don’t know if that is a good source for about his background.


Additionally, all external links on the page go to websites controlled by Mr. Wheaton, or are otherwise money making sources for him (e.g. Amazon link). 24 of the 61 references have an author listed of Mr. Wheaton or one of his websites.


The conclusion is this: This page seems to be solely designed to advertise and promote Mr. Wheaton. It was first published by a known paid writer, updated overtime primarily by people who only work on Mr. Wheaton’s page (and closely related topics), and exists today in a form which actively links to Amazon (and other) links which Mr. Wheaton is paid from while sourcing much of the information from Mr. Wheaton himself. 


I’m a very casual editor of Wikipedia, so I don’t know what the best course of action is for this article. [[User:SUPry|SUPry]] ([[User talk:SUPry|talk]]) 19:14, 30 October 2022 (UTC)}}

Prior to 4 October 2022, this page listed the individual [[Abadon (wrestler)]] under "female wrestlers" and the individual [[Sonny Kiss]] under "male wrestlers" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_All_Elite_Wrestling_personnel&oldid=1113455315 link]). Per their individual biography pages, Abadon self-identifies as non-binary and uses "they/them" pronouns, while Sonny Kiss identifies as genderfluid and uses both "he/his" and "she/her" pronouns. My reading of [[MOS:GENDERID]] is that referring to Kiss as a male and to Abadon as a female on this page is contrary to the policy. Accordingly, I changed the page to list Abadon and Sonny Kiss under "non-binary wrestlers" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_All_Elite_Wrestling_personnel&oldid=1114004554 link]).

'''Question:''' Which should be the main image of the Virgin Mary for this article?

To keep it official, I have opened an RfC since every few edits seems to change the picture without a real consensus. So, we will put it to a vote and discussion. I am proposing the following options, consisting of images used before and possible new ones as well so we have a wide selection to choose from:

<gallery mode="packed" widths="200" heights="200">
File:The_Madonna_in_Sorrow.jpg|'''Option 1''': The current image
File:La Vierge au lys.jpg|'''Option 2''': The most recent image (prior to the last edit)
File:Hagiosoritissa Santa Maria in Via Lata (Rome).png|'''Option 3''': Early Byzantine portrait
File:Virgen de guadalupe1.jpg|'''Option 4''': [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], suggested by IP user above
File:Madonna Advocata.png|'''Option 5''': ''Maria Advocata'', edited in by an earlier user
File:Detailed Lady of Absam.png|'''Option 6''': [[Our Lady of Absam]], suggested by me
Sassoferrato_-_Jungfrun_i_bön.jpg|'''Option 7''': Another picture from the Commons (''Jungfrun i bön'' - ''The Virgin in Prayer'' - by [[Giovanni Battista Salvi da Sassoferrato|Sassoferrato]])
</gallery>
Plenty of options to choose from here, so let's all try to agree on something great! [[User:That Coptic Guy| — That Coptic Guy]] ([[User talk:That Coptic Guy|talk]]) 16:49, 5 October 2022 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The {{para|official_name}} parameter is optional but it I think that an official consensus needs to be reached on it as there seems to be pushback above its use. The official name usually says '''City of X''' or '''Town of X''' as that is the official name for them while the common name has a shortened version which usually says '''Town name''' or '''Town name, State or Province''' ([[Detroit|Example of this in action]].) I have been recently in contact with someone who is against the use of it and states that it's redundant and not useful. The problem is that the template offers no instructions on its use, so it seems that many different users have interpreted its use differently. Either the original template authors didn't factor in its use or didn't think it would be used as much as it currently is. The discussion here is not weather the cites call themselves City of X because almost all do; rather is it useful to include on Wikipedia. Keep in mind that the consensus from the discussion will affect thousands or articles across the United States and Canada.

# '''Keep''' - No change, though its use is better written in the instructions.
# '''Remove''' - Remove from template all together.
# '''Change''' - Change the use of the parameter.

There has been an overgoing, almost years-long dispute on the wording of this part of the lead. With one side stating that there is a consensus in the literature that circumcision definitely reduces STD's in certain contexts and reduces the incidence of urinary tract infections. The other saying that  there is no consensus and that the lead should merely state that there is an "association" between circumcision and UTI/STD prevalence. A small minority of editors have gone further: stating that circumcision ''increases'' the incidence of STD's and UTI's: [[Talk:Circumcision#Prevention of STDs is highly disputed|citing various sources]].

'''Version #1: '''

<blockquote>Circumcision '''reduces '''rates of sexually transmitted infections and urinary tract infections.</blockquote> 

'''Version #2: '''

<blockquote>Circumcision '''is associated with''' reduced rates of sexually transmitted infections and urinary tract infections</blockquote> 

The RfC question: 

*'''Is circumcision merely "associated with" reducing STD's/UTI's? Or does it definitely reduce forms of both, given certain contexts? 
*'''Is version #1 or #2 a better description of consensus?'''

Note that this is '''not''' a discussion on whether circumcision in developed nations is appropriate, ethical, or should be routine. (Or whether risks outset these metrics.) 

Rather, it is asking on whether there a general agreement among sources that circumcision definitely reduces UTI's and certain STD's in certain contexts? 

A [[Talk:Circumcision and HIV|very similar RfC discussion is ongoing]] on the [[circumcision and HIV]] page. So editors here might want to check that out as well. Thanks! [[User:KlayCax|KlayCax]] ([[User talk:KlayCax|talk]]) 19:40, 7 October 2022 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I don't think I've ever started an RfC before, but I'm trying because I think this is important. I'm starting this because I think that it'd be useful when there's only 6 people (including me) that are considered "active" (as in, editing anything JW-related in the past two years) by the WikiProject. Jeffro77 cares a lot about Jehovah's Witnesses-related articles and I'm not discounting that, but I think further eyes might help on a subject matter like this. A lot of this hasn't really taken place on this talk page but there's some context at Jeffro77's talk page. Now on to the purpose of this RfC: 
* Are primary sources reliable in this matter? I would argue, no, and that the situation is similar, but not exactly the same, as to what is described at [[Disconnection (Scientology)]]. Here's one reason why I don't think relying on primary sources like ''Shepherd the Flock of God'', a handbook for elders, is the best idea [https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/03/the-secret-jehovahs-witness-database-of-child-molesters/584311/]
* Is it relevant to include information about being shunned by family members? I would say yes, it is important to clarify that it's not simply the congregation that shuns you. I don't nessecarily agee with this: {{tquote|There is no problem with the editor’s latest removal of ‘the congregation’ in the lead sentence, but it isn’t necessary to elaborate there about the nuances of which family members are shunned (and without the nuances is a misleading simplification).}} Yes, there's nuance, but I think the article as-is is misleading in itself. [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40704990][https://jme.bmj.com/content/26/5/381][https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11089-020-00935-0][https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/religious-shunning-jehovahs-witness-1.3767074#:~:text=What%20is%20shunning%20and%20why,they%20are%20a%20family%20member.] These are just some of the many sources that could be used here, but here's a quote from the last one: "There are typically two routes of leaving the JW: (1) disfellowship (forced exit), the result of contravening religious rules, and (2) leaving the group voluntarily (known as disassociation or fading). Regardless of the exit route, former members often report being mandatorily shunned by their family and friends who remain in the faith".
I get that the edits from the new editor, {{u|GiaHova}}, aren't ideal, but I do think they could potentially be lead in the right direction and that their argument that the article is misleading as-is and relies on primary sources has some merit. I think a broader consensus that isn't like three or four people might be useful.

For background, see this recent thread on the Admin's Noticeboard: [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Are_CSD_tags_edits_for_the_purposes_of_WP:G13?|Are CSD tags edits for the purposes of WP:G13?]]

The question is: Does a human CSD tagging a draft, in and of itself, count against "{{!xt|have not been edited by a human in six months}}" of CSD G13? and how do we resolve this paradox? Should we? If so, what should be included?

'''Option 1:''' A human tagging a draft <u>does not</u> reset the clock, but anyone (admin or otherwise) removing a CSD tag <u>does</u>.
{{ctop|bg=#C9D0FC|Option 1 revision text|2=The edit is shown in green italics}}
This applies to any pages that have not been edited by a human in six months found in:
# [[Wikipedia:Drafts|Draft namespace]],
# [[WP:UD|Userspace]] with an {{Tl|AFC submission}} template
# Userspace with no content except the [[Wikipedia:Article Wizard|article wizard]] placeholder text.
Redirects are exempt from G13 deletion. ''{{tq|Adding a CSD template to a page does not reset the six month clock, but removing a CSD template does.}}'' Pages deleted under G13 may be restored upon request by following the procedure at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion/G13]].

:'''Option 1.5''': Removal of a G13 tag by a user who claims to intend to improve the draft <u>does</u> restart the clock, procedural removal <u>doesn't</u>. <small>(c/o @[[User:Animal lover 666|Animal lover 666]])</small>
{{hr}}
'''Option 2:''' A human making an "edit to the content of the draft" <u>does</u> reset the clock, but any other kind of edit (e.g. tagging with a CSD, admin actions on that tag) <u>does not</u>. <small>(c/o @[[User:Szmenderowiecki|Szmenderowiecki]])</small>
{{ctop|bg=#FCC9C9|Option 2 revision text|2=The edit is shown in green italics}}
This applies to any pages ''{{tq|without a human edit that visibly changes article content in six months. This applies to:}}''

# [[WP:UD|Userspace]] with an {{Tl|AFC submission}} template
# Userspace with no content except the [[Wikipedia:Article Wizard|article wizard]] placeholder text.
Redirects are exempt from G13 deletion. Pages deleted under G13 may be restored upon request by following the procedure at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion/G13]]. ''{{tq|Nominating these pages for speedy deletion or [[WP:PROD|proposed deletion]], administrator actions to these nominations, as well as additions of [[Wikipedia:Tagging_pages_for_problems#Lists_of_tags|problem tags]] to these pages without any further action, do not start a new six-month period.}}''
{{cbot}}

'''Option 3:''' <u>Clarify</u> that any human edit, including a CSD tag, <u>does</u> reset the clock. In essence, humans should not use G13.

This applies to any pages that have not been edited by a human in six months found in:
# [[Wikipedia:Drafts|Draft namespace]],

# Userspace with no content except the [[Wikipedia:Article Wizard|article wizard]] placeholder text.
Redirects are exempt from G13 deletion. ''{{tq|A 'human edit' means that manually adding a CSD template to a page will reset the six month clock.

# Userspace with no content except the [[Wikipedia:Article Wizard|article wizard]] placeholder text.
Redirects are exempt from G13 deletion. It was determined that the community consensus in [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 135#Draft Namespace Redirects|this RfC]] regarding draft namespace redirects amounted to "there is a clear consensus against deletion of draft namespace redirects. There is a rough consensus against the alternative proposal to delete draft namespace redirects after six months." Pages deleted under G13 may be restored upon request by following the procedure at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion/G13]].

On 2 March 2022 [[Volodymyr Struk]], a pro-Russian mayor in the town of Kremnina, was abducted and shot dead by unknown gunmen.

On 8 September, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported a wave of assassinations and attempted killings against Russian-appointed officials and Ukrainian collaborators, as Ukrainian hit squads and saboteurs gunned down, blown up, hanged and poisoned almost 20 people considered to be collaborators of the puppet governments of [[Donetsk People's Republic|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk People's Republic|Luhansk people's republics]].<ref name="WaPo_Hit_Squads">{{Cite news |date=8 September 2022 |title=Ukrainian hit squads target Russian occupiers and collaborators |language=en-US |work=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/09/08/ukraine-assassinations-occupied-territory-russia/ |access-date=2022-10-12 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref> The assassination campaign was described as raising questions "about extrajudicial killings and potential war crimes, particularly when the targets are political actors or civilians".<ref name="WaPo_Hit_Squads" />

On 27 September, the [[ Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] documented six killings of alleged "traitors" of Ukraine. The victims were local authority officials, policemen and civilians who were believed to have voluntarily cooperated with the enemy. According to OHCHR, these killings may have been committed by government agents or with their acquiescence and could constitute extrajudicial executions and war crimes.<ref>{{cite report |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/country-reports/report-human-rights-situation-ukraine-1-february-31-july-2022 |title=Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 1 February to 31 July 2022 |date=27 September 2022 |publisher=[[OHCHR]] |access-date=10 Oct 2022 |at=para. 40}}</ref>

I have noticed some discussions about [[neopronouns]], but mostly on a case-by-case basis and mainly focusing on [[noun-self pronouns]], so I am starting this RfC for a more comphrensive discussion. The current policy on neopronouns states:

:{{tq|When the subject of the article identifies with [[neopronouns]], the pronouns should default to [[singular they]].}}

Based on previous discussions, I identify some options:

* '''Option A''': Allow all neopronouns
* '''Option B''': Don't use [[noun-self pronouns]], use other neopronouns (e, xe, xir, zir etc; see [[Gender neutrality in languages with gendered third-person pronouns#Table of standard and non-standard third-person singular pronouns|this table of English third-person singular pronouns]] for more)
* '''Option C''': Retain status quo (use singular ''they'')
* '''Option D''': Refer to subjects only by name
* '''Option E''': Mention the neopronouns once in the article lead, default to singular ''they'' otherwise
* '''Option H''': Use the pronouns most common in recent reliable and independent sources

Other possible options are welcome.

'''The issue to !vote on''': Should we retain the existing DYK box as it stands on the Main Page, with its quirky hooks "interesting to a broad audience", but add a second box containing factual hooks for specialist articles?

'''Note''': this issue to vote on is solely about whether we want a second box or not, and the discussion is about why we may or may not want a second box for WP's improvement. At this stage, it is not about logistics such as whether we have enough reviewers, or where the templates should be listed for review and prep, or Main Page overall design. 

'''History''': This issue was triggered by difficulties on [[Template:Did you know nominations/Talia Or]] (and previously many other similar difficulties on previous nomination templates). In the hope of resolving the difficulties which were stalling the progress of certain DYK nominations, a discussion and Rfc was opened at: [[Wikipedia talk:Did you know#Request for comment: The need to update Wikipedia:DYK#gen3]]. The difficulty was that some reviewers felt that DYK hooks should all have quirky or intriguing elements aimed at a "general audience" (however one defines that). But some nominators and reviewers felt that sometimes a factual hook was the only type suitable for a particular article, even if that article contained potential quirky-hook material. It has been impossible to reach a compromise, and that is why the idea of an extra hook box arose, and why the Rfc has been opened here. Please see the "Possible reasons for adding another hook box" section below, for more information. [[User:Storye book|Storye book]] ([[User talk:Storye book|talk]]) 13:49, 15 November 2022 (UTC)}}

It has come to my attention that the ranked list on this page is woefully outdated or possibly completely fabricated. The source listed was archived in 2013, with data only as recent as 2011. Yet the listed dates for each row are much more recent, circa 2019. What numbers I have checked against the source don't line up with any year. Also, a quick search of several other sources for the most recent median income by country returns drastically different numbers. For example, the most recent World Bank data has the US at a median income (PPP) less than half the current listed value on this page ... source: https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/median-income-by-country

Should the current list be preserved and amended? Or completely removed and replaced? Which sources are considered the most reliable for this kind of information? In order to most accurately update it. [[User:JimsMaher|JimsMaher]] ([[User talk:JimsMaher|talk]]) 22:06, 31 October 2022 (UTC)}}

I propose to update the article with the following draft below making a short description on parts of the scheme (image). Regardless of their function I just propose to mention that sub-circuits of the scheme resemble commonly used circuits in cMOS logic family. In order to avoid possible confusion, I also propose to say that the left-stage inveter (which is B-driven) circuit is not acting exactly like a NOT gate.

{{ping|Mn1548}} My overall preference is that [[Cardiff Arms Park]] is not split. The main problem for me in spitting is that it ends up with too many articles on the one subject. However, I think if a split is the consensus of the Wikipedia community, then there are two options to consider that may be acceptable to editors: 

*Option 1: Do not split, i.e. revert it back to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cardiff_Arms_Park&oldid=1120321667 original version] prior to the split. 
*Option 2: Split as:
**[[Cardiff Arms Park]], to tell the overall story of the site, then...
**[[Cardiff Arms Park (rugby ground 1876 to 1967)]], the old stadium/ground, before the National Stadium was built
**[[Cardiff Arms Park (rugby ground)]] the present day stadium/ground and 
**[[National Stadium (Cardiff)]], (unfortunately this new article is now a mess) although to be clear it would be better to rename it [[National Stadium (Cardiff Arms Park)]]
**[[Cardiff Arms Park Stadium]] redirected into [[Cardiff Arms Park (rugby ground)]]

The phenomenon and the slang term ''male camel toe'' is common, and I find it insulting (for women) not to mention it alongside the description of female camel toe.

google "male cameltoe" - 420,000 results

google "male camel toe" - 80,000 results

google "moose toe" - 12,000 results (moose knuckle is another thing)

There are several photos in commons - [[c:Category:Cameltoes|Category:Cameltoes]]

It happens unintentionally, but there are also   [https://www.etsy.com/listing/502675162/camel-toe-panty-gaff-for-male-to-female panties for sale] for men who wish to create camel toe deliberately.

Thank you,

{{rfcquote|text=
This is an RFC because the decision spans [[:Category:Abortion in the United States by state]]; most articles in that category contain this boilerplate. The "Terminology" and "Context" section of these articles typically contain two paragraphs of copied boilerplate which attempts to explain the terminology and context of abortion in the united states. The text, and the sources, do not connect the information to the U.S. state in question, or any state at all. The sources are generalized according to the lessons attempted to be imparted by the "Terminology" and "Context" sections. The [[Abortion in Texas]] article, for example, already bears a {{tl|relevance}} tag from September 2021.

I propose that all generalized text be removed from these sections. If there is relevant prose left it may be merged into the rest of the article or retained in an appropriately-named section. Per [[WP:UNDUE]] and [[WP:COATRACK]], it is important that each state-related article remain focused on the U.S. state which is its topic. Please consider removing irrelevant and unfocused information, particular in "Terminology" and "Context" sections which have been copied over and over to each article.

'''TLDR: should this redirect ''[[Nazis]]'' be retargeted to [[Nazi Party]] instead of its present destination, [[Nazism]]'''?<br/>

As of writing, there are 2 other redirects that are of interest and relating to this, which is [[Nazi]] (currently targeting to the [[Nazism]] ideology), and [[The Nazis]] (which targets to the [[Nazi Party]]). I agree that for the former two, these are the best options save for ''maybe'' making Nazi a disambiguation, but that's beyond the point of this RFC.

Presently, this redirect also targets to the Nazism ideology, however, it's difficult for Nazis plural to be able to refer to the Nazism ideology in common conversation. If I say "Nazis" in a discussion, I'm most frequently referring to either the regime/party/Third Reich, or neo-Nazi movements/participants. Based on this, I don't believe that "Nazis" ''plural'' as a redirect should target to the ideology but rather the party, as modern proponents of the ideology and party are designated as "neo-Nazis" rather than "Nazis" on WP. I believe a reader looking for information on Neo-Nazism would type neo-Nazism or related terms in the search box. A person typing "Nazis" would expect to find the regime, not the ideology. 

I understand some editors would suggest I [[WP:JUSTDOIT]], but given the high amount of controversy surrounding almost anything to do with the regime, the ideology, and the party, I think we should put this up for an RFC first given the drastic impact this could have. <b><span style="color:#0080FB">Invading</span><span style="color:#0668E1">Invader</span></b> ([[User:InvadingInvader|userpage]], [[User talk:InvadingInvader|talk]]) 04:01, 12 December 2022 (UTC)}}

The founder and chief editor of [[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]] was a major [[Ukrainian Nazi collaborators|Nazi collaborator]] [[Volodymyr Kubijovyč]] who [[World War II|during the war]] worked closely under [[Hans Frank]] in [[General Government|GG]]. Among other things Volodymyr Kubijovyč was an originator and funder of [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician)|14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS]] responsible for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Waffen_Grenadier_Division_of_the_SS_(1st_Galician)#Atrocities war atrocities]. After the war Kubijovyč settled in the West.

<u>Is the Encyclopedia of Ukraine a reliable source '''for [[World War II|WW2]] history'''?</u>


''Example:''

I’ll present you an article about Ukrainian Nazi collaborator and war criminal [[Roman Shukhevych]] responsible for the [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia|massacres]] of approximately 100,000 civilians.

'''The question:'''

*''' Is it a violation of [[WP: NPOV]] for the disambiguation page to state that "female circumcision" is predominately proscribed by major medical organziations? '''

There's recently been an [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Circumcision_(disambiguation)&action=history irretractable edit dispute] (and on this talk page above) on whether it is a violation of [[WP: NPOV]] and [[WP: Undue]] to state that the term "female circumcision" is strongly discouraged by major medical organizations. 

The original wording of the disambiguation page stated: 

<blockquote>{{tqi|Female circumcision, a [[Wiktionary:Appendix:Glossary#proscribed|proscribed]] term for female genital mutilation.}}</blockquote>

{{re|Neveselbert}} objected to this statement and deleted it. Arguing that the disambiguation page should simply read: 

<blockquote>{{tqi|Female circumcision}}</blockquote>

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Circumcision_%28disambiguation%29&type=revision&diff=1126768504&oldid=1126342584 While stating that it] would be 

<blockquote>{{tqi|completely unnecessary WP:POV-pushing}}</blockquote>

To state that "female circumcision" is proscribed by major medical practitioners and that labeling it as "female genital mutilation" is "controversial".  After a through discussion — see above — he requested that a RFC be performed on the matter and stated he would revert any reversion to the previous version.

And [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACircumcision_%28disambiguation%29&type=revision&diff=1127147103&oldid=1127146602 stating]:

<blockquote>{{tqi|They're not compulsory [descriptions for articles]], and when they're controversial they're usually omitted. Again, open a [[WP:RFC]] if you believe such a description is warranted.}}</blockquote>
 
Thus, per request, I created a RFC on the matter to prevent the start of an edit war. [[User:KlayCax|KlayCax]] ([[User talk:KlayCax|talk]]) 12:04, 14 December 2022 (UTC)}}

'''Option A (status quo)''':
There are several ongoing efforts by scientists, governments, international organisations, and others to determine the origin of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]], the virus responsible for the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. Most scientists say that as with other pandemics in human history, the virus is likely of [[zoonotic]] origin in a natural setting, and ultimately originated from a [[Bat virome|bat-borne virus]]. Many other explanations, including several [[COVID-19 misinformation#Misinformation regarding virus origin|conspiracy theories]], have been proposed about the origins of the virus. Some have speculated that SARS-CoV-2 was accidentally [[COVID-19 lab leak theory|released from a laboratory]], but there is no evidence for this, and it is considered much less likely than a natural origin.

QUESTION: Should we deprecate the Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary's ''World Religion Database''/''World Christian Database'', also published by the Association of Religion Data Archives, as [[WP:SPONSORED]], [[WP:PARTISAN]], [[WP:QUESTIONABLE]] & [[WP:CRYSTAL]], and the ''Pew-Templeton's Global Religious Futures'' dataset as [[WP:CRYSTAL]], thus as unreliable sources in the field of religion statistics and demographics?

Please see:
* The [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard&oldid=1122336651#Summary_of_general_consensus '''summary of general consensus'''] as a rationale for deprecation, with the main links to the datasets in question.
* The entire discussion above, and in particular the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard&oldid=1122336651#Authoritative_critical_assessments '''authoritative critical assessments'''] that have been collected.

Further considerations:
* Note well that this RfC for deprecation is unrelated to the "general consensus" elaborated hereabove, which is built on the discussion further above plus the fragmented consensuses about the same issue reached over the years in various Wikipedia talk pages (according to which the datasets in question should never replace data from censuses and statistical organisations, as they are built largely on Christian missionary sources and/or speculative projections, not yielded by actual surveys); this RfC will only enforce that consensus through deprecation, in case the community will express itself in favour of deprecation.
* A RfC for deprecation is needed because, despite the aforementioned fragmented consensuses collected over the years, the datasets in question are periodically re-added to Wikipedia articles about countries and religion demographics and passed off as results of actual surveys, and this could be better curbed with a deprecation warning.

Should the Caucasian cities be included in this list?

Currently there is no clear approach to cities in Caucasus (Tbilisi, Baku, Yerevan) and it causes edit wars. There has been a lot of discussion about it here but it's too long to read and despite the lenght it gives no clear guidelines about their inclusion/exclusion. So I think we should solve it once and for all. In the end it should end up in FAQ as Istanbul ended. The only consensus that has arised from the discussions so far is that they shouldn't be included without note about their unclear placement to Europe. --[[User:Pan Někdo|Pan Někdo]] ([[User talk:Pan Někdo|talk]]) 20:51, 17 November 2022 (UTC)}}

Which version of the Royal Dutch Medical Association's recommendations should be included in the article, the full version or the shortened version?

*'''Full version''': "Because the evidence that circumcision prevents HIV mainly comes from studies conducted in Africa, the Royal Dutch Medical Association (KNMG) in 2010 questioned the applicability of those studies to developed countries. Circumcision has not been included in their HIV prevention recommendations. The KNMG viewpoint document said that the relationship between HIV transmission and circumcision was unclear, and that behavioral factors seemed to have more of an effect on HIV prevention than circumcision. The KNMG also said that the choice of circumcision should be put off until an age when a possible HIV risk reduction would be relevant, so that boys could decide for themselves whether to undergo the procedure or choose other prevention alternatives. This KNMG circumcision policy statement was endorsed by several Dutch medical associations."
*'''Shortened version''': "Because the evidence that circumcision prevents HIV mainly comes from studies conducted in Africa, the Royal Dutch Medical Association (KNMG) in 2010 questioned the applicability of those studies to developed countries. Circumcision has not been included in their HIV prevention recommendations."

Some users have argued that the Royal Dutch Medical Association (KNMG) viewpoint is [[WP:FRINGE]] and out-of-date, while others have argued that the KNMG recommendations qualify as a "significant minority viewpoint" per [[WP:DUE]] and that it is important to include recommendations on circumcision & HIV from different regions of the world.

We can improve the presentation of names in this infobox by following the design of {{tl|Infobox mountain}}. Currently, all of the different kinds of names for a settlement are shown together in the header box, without explanation or labels. A reader doesn't know  the meaning or importance of each name.

Instead, I propose having a naming section in this infobox, below the images at the top of the infobox. The arguments to {{para|official_name}}, {{para|native_name}}, and {{para|other_name}} will be shown in the infobox, each with a label. I've implemented this proposal in the [[Template:Infobox settlement/sandbox|sandbox]]: you can see the differences by going to [[Template:Infobox settlement/testcases|the testcase page]] or [[Template:Infobox settlement/testcases2|the alternative testcase page]]. An example of such an infobox is shown to the right.

Not only will this be clearer for readers (IMO), but will also resolve the redundancy issue brought up by {{U|Surtsicna}}, above, by moving the display of {{para|official_name}} out of the header, and clearly labeling it. What do other editors think?

(Hat tip to {{U|DiscoA340}} --- one of their suggestions [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Cities/US Guideline#Infobox redundancies|here]] triggered this idea)

The way the tables are set up, they show the results before they occur, which would violate CRYSTAL if it were intentional, but is simply because they tables are not set up to display ongoing events.

There is a current dispute on the section of international responses. The bombing campaign of Syria has been met with hard opposition from the US, and most sources have consensus on this, with the US publicly stating it opposes any Turkish intervention, with US troops being stationed with the SDF in Syria.[https://www.voanews.com/a/another-major-turkish-military-ground-incursion-very-likely-amid-rising-tensions-in-syria-experts-say-/6844866.html 1][https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3227725/dod-statement-on-escalating-actions-in-iraq-syria-and-turkey/ 2] Ecrusized wants to include a series of quotes of US condemnation to the [[2022 Istanbul bombing]] yet I find these quotes are completely unrelated, they should be included in that article not this. The text of "The Pentagon opposes any Turkish intervention" is directly sourced from the DoD quote "The Department of Defense continues to oppose any military action that destabilizes the situation in Syria or violates Iraq’s sovereignty through military actions uncoordinated." I find this is a good description of the source yet Ecrusized states this is editorialization. A third opinion would be generally helpful.

For starters, I'll admit I'm not well versed on mobsters or wiki editing policies, so this request may be misguided but in short:

In the last few years of edit history, claims have sprung up asserting that article subject is deceased. Sourcing isn't great on this article in general, so these claims of death are not only added without sources, but also the alleged date of death varies wildly. As of now, there's no semblance of consensus whatsoever. In my attempt to fill out other parts of the article, I came across a recent [https://casetext.com/case/conte-v-tapps-supermarket-inc court case] (28 Sep, 2022) where the parties involved are close relatives:
<blockquote><blockquote><small>''Plaintiff Anthony Conte, appearing ''pro se, ''commenced this action against Defendants Tapps Supermarket, Inc., Seven Seas Partners, Inc., Anthony C. Conte, Paul S. Conte, and Pasquale Conte, Jr., '''the Estate of Pasquale Conte, Sr.''', Anthony Bileddo, and Feder Kaszovitz LLP, for purportedly stealing/depriving Plaintiff of stock, ...''</small></blockquote></blockquote>

It can be reliably inferred from this that Pasquale is deceased<sup>(''recently?'')</sup>, no? I imagine ''Pasquale Conte, Sr.'' has to be him, and Pasquale junior is some descendant. Can this be construed into a valid citation somehow? There are no other credible sources, not even dubious sources, that have reported on this. I believe the article should state he's deceased, but I can't really support the edit with my original research on some tangentially related court case that happens to mention Pasquale's estate.

'''Proposal''': Pinging {{u|Rsk6400}}, {{u|Roger 8 Roger}}, {{u|Mellk}}, RFC for guideline: I would also like to propose a new guideline for this issue, since I've been seeing heavy disputes with this:

If an article of a population center in '''de jure''' Ukraine that have the exact same '''English rendering of Ukrainian''' and '''English rendering of Russian names''' (i.e. [[Kherson]], [[Simferopol]], [[Yalta]], [[Kerch]]), the header would display both Russian and Ukrainian names if at least one of the criterias below are met: 

* '''The population center is near the frontline or is in a battle between Russia and Ukraine.'''
* '''The population center is under de facto control of Russia.'''
* '''Significant events occuring in or near the population center that relates with Russia.'''

If an article of a population center in '''de jure''' Ukraine has a different English rendering of Ukrainian and Russian names (i.e. [[Kharkiv]], [[Kyiv]], [[Luhansk]], [[Kryvyi Rih]]), '''the English rendered Russian name''', as well as the '''Russian name''', shall be put alongside the '''English rendered Ukrainian name''' and the '''Ukrainian name''', if at least one of the criterias below are met:

* '''The population center is under de facto control of Russia.'''
* '''The English rendered Russian name of the population center has a higher prevalence than the English rendered Ukrainian name of the population center, in at least one comparison, when compared with Google News, Ngram, etc.'''

{{rfcquote|text=
Editors have been talking for months about the interaction of various policies and procedures around cited material whose inclusion is disputed on grounds related to whether the material is verifiable.  Here's the scenario:

Alice and Bob decided to create an article together.  They were editing collaboratively until they ran into a serious disagreement.  One of them wants to briefly mention a related subject, and the other doesn't think that related subject should be mentioned at all (in this particular article).  They are unable to agree, and when you look on the talk page, you find a discussion between multiple editors, which is very evenly divided.  These are the facts:

# The material in question is fully verifiable, factually correct, well cited to two high-quality reliable sources, and not about a [[Wikipedia:BLP|BLP]].   
# There is no consensus to include the material and ''equally'' no consensus to exclude the material.  There are good arguments on both sides.
# It is not possible to compromise half-way, because there is no way to write an article so that it both briefly mentions, and also does not mention at all, the related subject.

You edit in this area regularly, so these editors have asked you personally for your advice on the dispute.  Specifically, they ask you to tell them whether you believe that it is generally better for Wikipedia to include or exclude material in this type of situation.

Your job is to finish this sentence:  '''"When editors have been unable to reach an agreement about whether to include a piece of verifiable, cited material, I believe it is usually best for Wikipedia to ______"'''. 18:08, 1 December 2022 (UTC)}}

I am starting a new RfC that will hopefully be more neutral and lead to some actual progress rather than me being brash and presenting poor options. The RfC will involve these articles:
{{hlist|[[Flute repertoire]]|[[Bassoon repertoire]]|[[Trumpet repertoire]]|[[Trombone repertoire]]|[[Tuba repertoire]]|[[Viola repertoire]]}} (Note: As [[Euphonium repertoire]] and [[Organ repertoire]] are largely prose, they are not included in this proposal.)

'''Question 1''': Should this batch of articles be renamed to "List of compositions for ''(instrument)''"? 

'''Question 2''': What should the criteria be for inclusion in these articles? (For example, 'it must have a Wikipedia page', 'must be listed in several index of works', 'must be written by a notable composer', etc.) This was briefly discussed at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Classical music#Establishing criteria for entries]], but was never formally settled.

Question 2 is extended to include articles such as:
{{hlist|[[List of compositions for cello and organ]]|[[List of compositions for two violins]]|[[List of compositions for viola: A to B]] (and other letters)|[[List of compositions for piano duo]]}} [[User:Why? I Ask|Why? I Ask]] ([[User talk:Why? I Ask|talk]]) 21:33, 1 December 2022 (UTC)}}
