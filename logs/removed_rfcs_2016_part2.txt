The [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sia_Furler&oldid=723873369 current revision] uses "Sia" throughout the whole article. I want to change from "Sia" to "Furler" to be consistent with the present title. However, in previous discussions, consensus prefer "Sia" in the infobox instead. Therefore, I figure that a discussion is needed instead. What are your thoughts on this proposal? --[[User:George Ho|George Ho]] ([[User talk:George Ho|talk]]) 20:31, 5 June 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I was under the impression that the following sentence was [[WP:SYNTH]] (and another editor thought it was [[WP:OR]]) because it implies that the air action of the Pleiku Campaign was more significant than the ground action of the Battle of Ia Drang without the sources making that claim, or that it violates [[WP:N]] by challenging the significance of this battle; I also feel that the comparison being made is between two things that aren't easily compared, so I don't think the comparison needs to be made in this article at all:
<blockquote>"The air action spent more times,[68] operated in a wider areas,[69] committed more units[70] and attacked more enemy forces,[71] than the ground action."</blockquote>
The editor that wrote this sentence claims that it is a statement of facts that're reliably sourced, and that the comparison is [[WP:BLUE]]. Does this sentence violate any policy or guideline, need rewording, or need removal?

{{rfcquote|text=
The lead already says: "A nominated article is marked for at least seven days; if nobody objects, it is considered by an uninvolved admin, who reviews the article and may delete it or may remove the PROD tag. "

To make the rest of the policy consistent with that, the following changes are proposed:

* In the lead:

<blockquote>;There are three steps to the PROD process:
# To nominate an article, place the {{tlxs|Proposed deletion|2=concern=''reason for proposed deletion''}} tag on the page. This is automatically converted to a {{tlx|proposed deletion/dated}} which lists the article in [[:Category:Proposed deletion]]. You should notify the article's creator or other significant contributors by adding the {{Tlsp|Proposed deletion notify|''Name of Article‎''}} tag or other appropriate text to contributor talk pages.
# If anybody objects to the deletion (usually by removing the {{tlx|proposed deletion/dated}} tag—see full instructions below) <u>within seven days of the PROD tag being placed</u>, the proposal is aborted and may not be re-proposed.
# The article is first checked and then deleted by an administrator seven days after nomination (or any time after seven days that an administrator reviews the article). It may be [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion|undeleted upon request]]. If the reviewing administrator does not agree with the deletion they may remove the PROD tag instead of deleting the article.</blockquote>

* In the "Objecting" section (with notes removed only to reduce clutter)<br>

<blockquote>'''To object to and therefore permanently prevent a proposed deletion <u>during the seven days after the PROD tag has been placed</u>''',remove the {{tlx|proposed deletion/dated}} tag from the article. You are encouraged, but not required, to also:
# Explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion, either in the edit summary or on the talk page.
# Consider notifying the editors involved in the PROD by placing a {{tl|Deprod}} tag on their user talk page.
# Add or modify an {{tl|Old prod full}} tag on the article's talk page, to prevent renomination under Proposed deletion. It will then be listed at [[:Category:Past proposed deletion candidates]] for easy tracking.
# Consider improving the article to address the concerns raised.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'''If anyone, including the article creator, removes a {{tlx|proposed deletion/dated}} tag from an article <u>during the seven days after the PROD tag was placed</u>, do not replace it,''' even if the tag was apparently removed in [[WP:ABF|bad faith]]. This excludes removals that are clearly not an objection to deletion, such as page blanking or obvious vandalism, and tags removed by [[WP:Banning policy|banned users]] may be restored. If you still believe that the article needs to be deleted, or that the article should be deleted but with discussion, list it on [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion]].</blockquote>

While other workarounds are yet to be found the solution to [[phab:T136688]] and [[phab:T136685]] it will probably be solved by repacing all instances of <nowiki>[h] in TeX/LaTeX (and in MathJax) with [tcb] as [h] is not a valid tag and was seen by the PNG rendering mode as [tcb] but now causes an error in the new mode</nowiki>. I propose that some sort of bot or AWB script is written to automaticaly or semi-automaticaly replace <nowiki>[h] in TeX/LaTeX (and in MathJax) with [tcb]</nowiki> to fix this problem as this was already accepted as the correct solution (pending actual code workarounds) at [[phab:T136685#2345546]].

In the second paragraph at [[WP:BIO1E]], the assassination that led to the start of World War I is given as an example (and the only example) of a "highly significant" event. To me, this suggests that the appropriate bar is whether the event is covered in, or can reasonably expected to be covered in,  history books. Others prefer a lower bar, especially for more recent events, that requires only extensive RS coverage and a subjective assessment of the event's impact—an assessment which often takes a short-term view. They would include events that very likely <u>will not</u> be covered in history books. Should the guideline be modified to clarify this point? If so, how? &#8213;[[User:Mandruss|<span style="color:#775C57;">'''''Mandruss'''''</span>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mandruss|<span style="color:#AAA;">&#9742;</span>]] 19:07, 2 June 2016 (UTC)}}

* such data can be excluded only by including an empty parameter: e.g. {{para|isbn}}.  If the parameter is ''absent'' (rather than ''empty''), inclusion of WikiData will still happen automatically.

Some editors have brought up issues with [[WP:WD|Wikidata]] in infoboxes being included in this way. Should such inclusions continue to be "opt-out"?

This has [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam_Warlock&type=revision&diff=537975092&oldid=537949399 come up before], but [[User:Arionapollo]] has brought this up on [[User talk:Argento Surfer#Adam Warlock|my talk page]] and I thought I'd invite more voices to the table since this could apply to other characters as well.

Basically, the [[Adam Warlock]] publication history currently says "The character debuted in Fantastic Four #66-67 ... [and had] a second appearance as "Him" in Thor #165-166" Arionapollo, citing CGC and Overstreet, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam_Warlock&type=revision&diff=719894035&oldid=719888695 wants to note] the ''Fantastic Four'' issues are a cameo, and specify the character's "first full appearance" as the ''Thor'' issues. However, 
* The FF issues present his origin in full. 
* Old ''Wizard'' magazines note that FF 66 is a cameo, and FF67 is the first appearance. 
* Marvel says his first appearance was [http://marvel.com/universe/Warlock,_Adam FF 66]. 
* There was a 2 year gap between the FF and Thor stories. 

I think the current wording is sufficiently generic, and avoids making a judgment on what's a cameo and what's a true first appearance. Google [https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=adam+warlock+first+appearance+thor+165 provides some additional support] for the Thor books, but all the top hits are from sites promoting the book for its sale value. 

[[Venom (comics)]] gives his first appearance as ASM #300, and specifies in the publication history he appeared in cameo on the last page of #299. 
[[Apocalypse (comics)]] gives his first appearance as X-Factor #5 in the lead, and the infobox specifies #5 was "in shadow" and #6 was "first full appearance". 
The lead and PH of [[Wolverine (character)]] mentions Hulk 180 as his "first appearance" and Hulk 181 as his "first full appearance". The infobox has Hulk 180 listed as a cameo.

# Should the publication history section or infobox distinguish between cameos and first appearances?
# Is this disagreement significant enough to discuss within the article?

It's ridiculous that most experienced editors avoid requesting adminship because they don't want to go through the RfA process. After [[Wikipedia:RFA reform|5 reforms]], no ''major'' changes have been made. I think with a final RfA reform, the process should be completely recreated. Something i'm proposing is the creation of "RfA guidelines", where certain topics cannot be discussed in the RfA (edit count, incidents that occurred 8 years ago, etc.) I think with a new RfA reform, the number of sysops will increase significantly. Additionally, i'm proposing that [[WP:RECALL]] be promoted to policy and be required for all sysops, making it easier for administrators to be desysopped. <span style="font-family:sans-serif; color:red">&mdash; <span style="font-weight:bold">[[User:Music1201|<span style="color:green"> Music1201</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Music1201|<span style="color:red">talk</span>]]</sup></span></span> 22:40, 16 June 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
There seems to be dispute among editors wether or not a given candidate is a "presumptive nominee." For example, a lot of editors think that [[Gary Johnson]] or [[Jill Stein]] should be considered the presumptive nominee of their party, others disagree. I think it would be helpful to reach a consensus on what makes someone a presumptive nominee. 

First, I would like to point out what [[presumptive nominee|our article on presumptive nominees]] says: "a candidate becomes the presumptive nominee of his or her party when his or her last serious challenger drops out or when he or she mathematically clinches—whichever comes first." My interpretation of what this is saying would imply that, for someone to be the presumptive nominee, one of these two things must be:
#He or she has no challenger from his/her same party that is featured in a major poll.
#He/she has obtained 50% or more of his or her party's delegates.
The above seems pretty reasonable to me. However, some editors seem to think differently; they think that a major news agency has to announce him/her the presumptive nominee of their party before Wikipedia does. This disagreement could affect at what point in time should we call [[Hillary Clinton]] the presumptive Democratic nominee, or wether [[Jill Stein]] ''is'' currently the presumptive nominee for the Green Party.

I think it would be helpful for this election and future elections for Wikipedia to have a consensus on what makes a candidate the "presumptive nominee" of their party. --[[User:Proud User|Proud User]] ([[User talk:Proud User|talk]]) 23:21, 29 May 2016 (UTC)}}

## an edit history of sufficient length to show that the user is most likely acting in good faith, i.e. not a [[WP:ILLEGIT]] violator (e.g. ≥10 substantive edits over the course of ≥1 month)

I am starting a RfC to gather consensus on how the newly-renamed [[Executive Office (Northern Ireland)]] should be referred to. The department was recently renamed from the '''Office of First Minister and deputy First Minister''' to the Executive Office, but this name is rather generic for use on Wikipedia. Should the department be referred to in the lead of articles as simply the ''Executive Office'' or the ''Executive Office of Northern Ireland''. I'm asking because editors may take issue with a name other than the official name being used to introduce the department. <b>[[User:St170e|st170e]]</b><sup><i><small>[[User talk:St170e|talk]]</small></i></sup> 17:52, 23 May 2016 (UTC)}}

:::::: Requesting additional comments as [[User:Johnbod]] clearly can't read his own comments, which justified initial two reversion through "undue weight" argument that claimed previous articles didn't demonstrate-longstanding relationship. He is now reverting because five decades is apparently not long enough to suit him. Can we get some moderation please? Seems wikipedia editors love changing the goalposts when their original claim (argument:undue weight, rationale: no timeframe mentioned in first two insertions) has been debunked. And don't you dare lie like your hero Rothschilds, [[User:Johnbod]]. You said undue weight, tried to spin the concept I was a conspiracy theorist, to which I produced an article that CONCLUSIVELY states the relationship is AT LEAST fifty years. Not only did you not response (regardless of the three-revert warning), you then choose to revert again even though I produced a new source that met the requirements. {{ping|The Anome}} … unsigned, by [[Special:Contributions/31.208.7.22|31.208.7.22]] 15:41, 15 June 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Following the discussions at [[Talk:Birthright_Israel#Jerusalem.2C_Israel]] and [[User_talk:Debresser#1RR]] I want to open an Rfc about the question "Is Jerusalem in Israel or Palestine?"

After I reverted the removal of "Israel" from "Jerusalem, Israel" in a certain article, I was referred to [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Jerusalem]]. I noticed there that "There was no consensus for any phrasing of Jerusalem’s location in either Israel or Palestine." It does not say what to do. I also noticed that that Rfc was about the [[Jerusalem]] article only, and that it is binding for 3 years only, till July 9, 2016.

My first reaction was that in the absence of any clear consensus on this potentially controversial subject, the only acceptable course of action per Wikipedia policies and guidelines would be to refrain from changing any status quo. Then I cam to the realization that I could also initiate a process to try and establish a project wide consensus on this issue, some guideline on the issue, much like [[WP:WESTBANK]] regarding another related hot potato.

I then did some research. A simple search of Wikipedia teaches that there are 438 instances of "Jerusalem, Palestine" on Wikipedia and 9,268 of "Jerusalem, Israel". I came to the conclusion that that fact proves that both alternatives are considered completely acceptable on Wikipedia, and with a ratio of roughly 1:21 even makes a point for "Jerusalem, Israel" over "Jerusalem, Palestine". Also compare the Google search results, which are 331,000 to 5,950,000, roughly 1:18. I remember from my elementary school in Holland, that there never was any issue that Jerusalem is in Israel. Mind you, I am not talking about [[East Jerusalem]], the status of which is widely acknowledged as ambiguous, just simply "Jerusalem".

Then that same respected editor who pointed me to the Jerusalem Rfc, made another interesting point, namely that there is a difference between <nowiki>[[Jerusalem, Israel]] (or [[Jerusalem, Palestine]], for that matter) and [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]] (or [[Jerusalem]], [[Palestine]])</nowiki>, with the latter being more problematic in his eyes.

I see four general options:
# Replace all instances of "Palestine" by "Israel" (unless specific reference was made to [[[East Jerusalem]]);
# Remove all instances of "Israel" and "Palestine" from after "Jerusalem";
# Keep all instances as they are. This means that no changes will be allowed to whatever is the present version. In the case of a new article, local consensus should decide;
# Refrain from making a guideline and leave it up to local consensus. This option might be rephrased, and I mean this non-judgemental, as keep the present anarchy.

In addition there is an idea that can be implemented independently of whichever of the above options will be chosen:
# Replace all <nowiki>[[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]] and [[Jerusalem]], [[Palestine]] by [[Jerusalem, Israel]] (or [[Jerusalem, Palestine]]</nowiki>, to address at least the most problematic form of this issue.

Please take part in the discussion below, and at the end also express your vote. Please note that I made no discussion section regarding the independent replacement option, because I expect the general discussion to cover this as well.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&type=revision&diff=721868899&oldid=721863210] Material claiming that a source of intelligence information was Russian satellite data intercepted by a Norwegian listening station has been included in the article.  I suggest there a number of problems with this:

1. It is only covered in media outlets, with reference to a single TV report and a report on the TV show itself; effectively the same source.  I cannot find reference to it in any other [[WP:SECONDARY]] source.  Whilst we can look to a media report as a source, this isn't encouraged where it is the only source of data.  We also look to other sources that are considered more reliable.  I would suggest the current reference is inadequate.

2. Coverage in this article is disproportionate, it certainly doesn't merit two paragraphs.

3. The sensationalist terms used in the edit are completely inappropriate, with the suggestion is was somehow "vital" and let the British know where the Argentine navy was at all times.  This contradicts just about every source known on the conflict, which details the problems the British had in locating the Argentine carrier.  In any case the Argentine fleet withdrew to port after the sinking of the Belgrano and played no role in the conflict.

It has been removed on this basis several times, on each occasion removal was reverted with the comment "it is cited" "disagree with removal" but as far as I can see these discrepancies have not been addressed.  I suggest that on the basis laid out above, this is very much [[WP:FRINGE]] material, the coverage here is disproportionate and it should be removed.  <span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User:Wee Curry Monster|W]][[Special:contributions/Wee Curry Monster|C]][[User talk:Wee Curry Monster|M]]</span><sub>[[Special:EmailUser/Wee Curry Monster|email]]</sub> 20:11, 24 May 2016 (UTC)}}

There is [[User:BrightRoundCircle/sandbox/self-sourcing|established consensus]] that examples from popular culture are "not self-sourcing", that is, "'''The source(s) cited should not only establish the verifiability of the pop culture reference, but also its significance.'''" [[MOS:POPCULT]] "in popular culture" section currently suggests the cleanup of "unencyclopedically trivial" entries, but does not elaborate what they are. The article [[Wikipedia:"In_popular_culture"_content#Good_and_bad_popular_culture_references|"In popular culture"]] does elaborate on this, and makes it clear: "'''Although some references may be plainly verified by primary sources, this does not demonstrate the significance of the reference'''" and "'''[examples] should be reserved for major, in-depth treatments of the subject that have had lasting significance'''". Should the quoted text from the consensus of the RfC discussion and the "in popular culture" article be added to [[MOS:POPCULT]] for clarification of what is "unencyclopedically trivial"?

Although this article deals specifically with the "Constitution of Medina," it is my opinion that there is a place to mention, in passing, a similar pact or covenant made by Muhammad to the Jews living in Arabia, since it applies to the right of non-Muslims. 
The most appropriate place to add this small note is in the sub-section, "Rights of Non-Muslims," directly after the bullet which reads:
#Non-Muslims will not be obliged to take part in religious wars of the Muslims.
The edit which we are suggesting would read as follows:

:"In Yemenite Jewish sources, subsequent to the Constitution of Medina, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as ''kitāb ḏimmat al-nabi'', written in the 17th year of the [[Hijri year|Hijra]] (638 CE), and which gave express liberty unto Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks, but were required to pay the [[jizya]] (poll-tax) annually for their protection by their patrons." 
This edit will be backed-up by a footnote which reads:
:"[[Shelomo Dov Goitein]], ''The Yemenites – History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life'' (Selected Studies), editor: Menahem Ben-Sasson, Jerusalem 1983, pp. 288–299. ISBN 965-235-011-7."
If such an edit should be viewed by our fellow co-editors as informative in the general history of relations between non-Muslims, we will add the edit. Thanks in advance. [[User:Davidbena|Davidbena]] ([[User talk:Davidbena|talk]]) 14:08, 27 May 2016 (UTC)}}

I am requesting a comment on the notability of the following sources. I have been trying to establish notability for the Austin Petersen presidential campaign, 2016 and I believe the sources I have provided are reliable independent sources, most especially independent on the topic of Petersen or the Libertarian Party in general. I believe the sources show more than enough notability to qualify for [[WP:GNG]] but some users are claiming the sources are not enough as they claim the sources are not reliable. This is only a small list but I believe they are also disqualifying [[WP:NEXIST]] as there is a lot of other coverage including local coverage. While not all coverage is solely on the topic of Petersen's bid for presidency it does state in [[WP:GNG]] "Significant coverage is more than a trivial mention, but it does not need to be the main topic of the source material."

I believe we are being asked to show an unreasonable amount of sources to show notability. As well [[User:MelanieN]] is indicating that all the sources I listed should never be considered reliable, something that [[WP:IRS]] says is an incorrect statement. Even more so I believe the users denying notability are relying on [[WP:BIO]] when in fact the topic of this page is his campaign, an organization separate to a page on Ausin Petersen himself, and thus requires the use of [[WP:ORG]] and [[WP:GNG]] to establish notability as a campaign is an organization. I believe this page was unreasonably speedily deleted as the page deserves a discussion of it's own on notability.

I would like to propose the repeal of the language in this guideline which forbids the inclusion of image galleries in articles about human ethnic groups. This would bring such articles into conformity with Wikipedia's general practice of attempting to include informative image(s) in articles wherever reasonably possible. Even articles about sub-species groupings directly analogous to human ethnic groups, such as [[Maine Coon]], include images of their subjects.

Possible counter-arguments:
#Classification of people on the basis of ethnic group is offensive. -> Please see [[WP:NOTCENSORED]].
#Where no reliable sources for classification of specific people on the basis of ethnic group can be found, such classifications constitute original research. -> The original research policy [[WP:OI|specifically allows]] the use of original images in articles, even when visual analysis of photo content forms the sole basis for concluding that photos depict their purported subject matter.
#Human ethnic groups have no biological, genetic, or other scientific basis. Therefore, there is no reasonable basis for classifying photos of people as depictions of such groups. -> This argument is flat out wrong, according to "Genetic structure, self-identified race/ethnicity, and confounding in case-control association studies" {{PMID|15625622}}. This particular paper qualifies as a secondary [[WP:RS]] since the authors aren't analyzing data they collected themselves. Note also the approval of [[isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine]] by the FDA, which would have hardly occurred if human ethnicity were not a scientifically definable concept.
#The inherent uncertainty and changes over time in definitions of human ethnic groups creates a class of photos which may or may not depict a particular ethnic group. -> When depicting an ethnic group, we aim for the center, and not the edge.

Full disclosure:
I am opening a discussion about this issue in response to a dispute about whether [[Special:Permalink/680609377|a photo gallery for the White people article with the images I selected]] is appropriate for Wikipedia.

{{Edit request|a}}

I am submitting another request on behalf of Hilton Worldwide as part of my work for Beutler Ink. This request proposes 2 changes to the article's lead.

<hr>
{{Resolved}}

:1. I propose a slight wording change to improve flow, eliminate unnecessary detail (re: Chad), and update the number of rooms.

: Before: {{fontcolor|red|As of January 2016, Hilton Worldwide's portfolio includes 4,610 hotels with over 758,502 rooms. In January 2016, the opening of the Hilton in Chad marked the 100th country Hilton resides in, thus making the corporation the largest hotel chain in the world by rooms and international presence.}}

: After: {{fontcolor|green|As of March 2016, Hilton Worldwide's portfolio includes more than 4,660 properties with over 765,000 rooms in more than 100 countries, making the corporation the largest hotel chain in the world by rooms and international presence.}}

<hr>
{{Resolved}}
:2. Currently, the article's lead says, "The company has been a sponsor of the United States Olympic Team since 2005." This is no longer true. I propose changing the tense, since the company is no longer a sponsor, and moving the sentence from the lead to the article's [[Hilton Worldwide#History|History]] section. This past sponsorship does not seem like something worth mentioning in the lead.

<hr>

Should the last paragraph of the lead be shortened to "'''it is not possible to ''delete'' an account'''."?

''' Reasoning '''

Currently, the last paragraph of the lead reads:

: Due to all contributions being licensed under the [[Wikipedia:Text of Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|CC BY-SA 3.0 License]] and the [[Wikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL]], '''it is not possible to ''delete'' an account'''.

This is disingenuous.  These licenses set out no such requirements.  If we're to put aside community norms for a minute, the reason for not being able to delete accounts is technical; as anybody who's had their username changed would know, the software allows for accounts to be created under a previously-held username.  The theory is, if we were to delete somebody's account, somebody else could register under the same name and assume authorship of the departed user's edits.  There's ways to get around this, but none have been pursued for different reasons; foremost is the community's obsession with requiring editors to identify with only one handle - an obsession that is borne of misguided notions of professionalism.  In any case, I suggest condensing the paragraph down to...

: '''it is not possible to ''delete'' an account'''.

... which is strictly factual.  Izkala ([[User talk:Izkala|talk]]) 01:13, 30 May 2016 (UTC)}}

A short discussion was [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#WP:DATERANGE_again|initially had above]] (the latest of many which went nowhere) regarding the re-introduction of the four-digit endrange year in [[WP:DATERANGE]]. When some support was garnered but discussion again stalled, it was then [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#WP:DATERANGE_ambiguity_and_stylistic_concerns|expanded to a discussion and !vote at the Village Pump]], garnering a high level of agree !votes to return to the original style of allowing—or even preferring—four-digit end years (''i.e. 2000–2016'') instead of the current two-digit end years (''i.e. 2000–16'') for ranges that occur post-11th century and within the same century. 
In addition to the support garnered at the Village Pump, it's becoming clear to me that the general editing public (and likely the general public itself) finds the 2000–16 format disagreeable, as I've already had to revert '''three instances''' ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anton_Yelchin&diff=prev&oldid=727482362],[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anton_Yelchin&diff=prev&oldid=726247993],[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anton_Yelchin&diff=prev&oldid=726090890]) within the last few days of someone changing "2000–16" to "2000–2016" in the infobox for [[Anton Yelchin]] (a high-traffic article due to the subject's recent death).

b) an editor notifies [[WT:COIN]] of that fact and provides the Elance link as proof, people than watch the article that does not yet exist 

c) someone on Elance wins the job, creates a new Wikipedia account, and than creates the article.

Consensus has been for some time that in general, lists of many aircraft types do not include the numbers built for each type. Two editors in particular have now challenged that in the case of lists for aircraft types in a given role. There appear to be three possible ways forward:
#Maintain the broad consensus that production numbers should not be listed.
#Change the broad consensus, to add production numbers to all lists of aircraft in table form.
#Make an exception for role-based lists of aircraft.
(An exception has been agreed for the numbers ''in service'' in lists for a given operator, but that is a different number with a particular rationale).

{{rfcquote|text=
I recently initiated [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#WP:DATERANGE_again|a discussion]] regarding [[WP:DATERANGE]], the MoS guideline that specifies use of two-digit abbreviated years in end-ranges (i.e. 1995–99 instead of 1995–1999) for years from the 11th century onward only. Objections have been raised regarding this guideline before, and now again, with many agreeing with my reasoning for reverting to the old format, but it never proceeds any further. Here are several reasons why the current guideline should be abandoned and reverted:

* Date ranges under the current format can easily be confused for something else entirely, especially for ranges ending in years '01–'12. For example, "2010–12" can easily be interpreted as December 2010 instead of a date range of 2010–2012.
* It looks very unprofessional IMHO. Saving a measly two digits is not worth giving the appearance of using unnecessary shortcuts/slang in a respectable encyclopedia.
* It doesn't read naturally for years in the 21st century spanning the 2000s decade to 2010 or later. This is mainly because years from 2000–2009 are usually pronounced "two thousand and", while years from 2010—present are usually said as "twenty". So a range such as 2000–16 being read as "two thousand to sixteen" sounds ridiculous. This is especially problematic for anyone having Wikipedia read aloud by a text-to-speech program.
* Implementation is inconsistent, since it is only applicable to years 1000 AD+ and to none of the years in the BC era (why not?), leading to more confusion and unnecessary stylistic asymmetry.

I am looking to canvass the wider community to see if there is support to revert to the older style, which <s>preferred</s> permitted the entire 4-digit year for end-ranges. Please indicate whether you support the current MoS guideline or the previous one. — '''[[User talk:Crumpled Fire|<font face="Lucida Fax"><font color="#2695A9">Crumpled Fire</font></font>]]'''<small> • ''[[Special:Contributions/Crumpled Fire|contribs]]'' •</small> 00:43, 18 June 2016 (UTC)}}

If a video game has a “Game of the Year Edition,” or an album has a “Collector’s Edition,” or a movie has a “Director’s Cut” release, should the edition name be italicized as well (per [[MOS:T#Major works]])? Is “Game of the Year Edition” considered a partial title, part of the name of the major work, for instance ''Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception: Game of the Year Edition''? (If so, should we also say “they released a ''Game of the Year Edition''”?) A brief internal search shows italics (and even capitalization) inconsistently applied to such labels, at least in video game articles:
*[[Call of Duty 2]] does not italicize “Special Edition” or “Game of the Year Edition,” and doesn’t even capitalize “a collector’s edition” or “the mobile version”.
*[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]] italicizes “''Game of the Year Edition''” both with the game title (with and without a preceding colon) and on its own, but not “Special Edition Soundtrack.”
*[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]] has “Game of the Year edition” roman with a small E, but italicizes “a ''Collector’s Edition''.”

One of the goals of the Manual of Style is to encourage consistency across WIkipedia. To that end, should [[MOS:T#Major works]] be edited to address this? What should it say? —[[Special:Contributions/67.14.236.50|67.14.236.50]] ([[User talk:67.14.236.50|talk]]) 22:29, 2 June 2016 (UTC)}}

Hi,

[[User:Fountains of Bryn Mawr]] disagrees that [[James Gregory (mathematician)| James Gregory]] had influenced [[Isaac Barrow]], however I provided a very robust document that was a 1916 translation of his work, which clearly showed high praise for Gregory's work.
It seems this user is just against establishing this relationship for some reason. It shouldn't be a surprise that Barrow had respect for gregory, and was influenced by his work, yet Bryn Mawr just can't let it go. I provided sources, and they try to claim a translated document from over 100 years ago, showing mutual respect, is somehow original research. It is not original research at all. Calling "the most learned man" is one of the highest compliments a scholar could pay another when using their work. I'm seeking moderation because the user may risk violating the [[Wikipedia:Edit warring#The three-revert rule|3RR]], and I feel what I've provided is quite compelling. I would have to dig a little more, but I find a translated primary source document containing such a phrase as the most compelling piece of evidence. Secondary accounts often are less convincing. <br>Here is some secondary analysis showing the impact of Gregory's work. Secondary analysis such as [http://physics.ucsc.edu/~michael/barrowleibniz15.pdf] (page 4, footnote 11) also refers to the quote I've used, but builds on it slightly more by also mentioning [[Gottfried Leibniz]]' praise of Gregory's work. So we can see that the work of Gregory impressed both Leibniz and Barrow. To suggest such esteemed scholars (of almost 400 years ago) use phrases like "the most learned man" or "elegant theorem by Gregory" (quite the compliments) without being influenced by them (where such influence is in the form of using their work, at the very least) is unreasonable. I just do not know what the editor wants, and it feels like the evidence provided was sufficient. I will try to find more sources but I do not know how what is already provided isn't sufficient to constitute as evidence for influence.<br>
Here is a letter by a prominent publishing intermediary (between Gregory, Barrow, and Newton) John Collins addressed to Gregory [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Extras/Collins_Newton.html] While the letter itself is somewhat mundane (he met Sir Isaac, had dinner, Sir Isaac said [[Opticks]] was going to continue where Reverend Barrow left off, and that Collins needn't ask about Sir Isaac's publishing commitments because Reverend Barrow said the Lucasian chair had such requirements already), it establishes that, while communication was slow at the time, Collins was clearly acting as a facilitator. Thus, the work of Gregory clearly had an influence on Barrow given that the publisher was writing about their progress to the former. Trying to find more.<br>
Here is another secondary source, [http://gec.ncut.edu.tw/teacher/math/homepage/liu_pohong/teach_class2_download.php?sn=14 The Historical Development of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus And Its Implication in Teaching]: <blockquote>Apparently, Fermat reduced a problem of rectification by connecting tangents and
the question of quadratures. Surprisingly, for all his deft use of infinitesimals in a variety of areas, he still failed to recognize this critical relation, denying himself the honored title of “true inventor of the calculus” (Boyer, 1959). The man first overtly aware of generality of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus was James Gregory in 1668, exerting a significant influence on Isaac Barrow’s work.</blockquote>
So I have to ask, why is [[Fountains of Bryn Mawr]] picking a fight over something that seems to be the consensus? Note: I am not talking about assigning priority/credit for the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (which is clearly a bit more involved), but the '''influence''' of their investigations on eachother's work. Clearly assigning priority of the fundamental theorem is difficult because their collaboration (facilitated by Collins where appropriate) muddled the "who did what" part.<br>
Found probably the most definitive scholarly literature on this issue, however, again, I must emphasise that the focus of these scholars is much more than that:
<blockquote>
Barrow's heavy "borrowings" include his restatement of "Gregory's generalization of Wren's proof of a construction for the tangent at a general point on a cyclid arc," as well as his appropriation of Gregory's "rectifying transformation," the basis of the Scot's ''involutio'' and ''evolutio'' method. Even barrow's most famous achievement--the proof for the inverse nature of differentiation and integration--was now reinterpreted as a "neat amendment of Gregory's generalization of Neil's rectification method." - Mordechai Feingold<ref>{{cite journal| last=Feingold|first=Mordechai| url=https://keats.kcl.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/1346678/mod_resource/content/4/Feingold.pdf| title= Newton, Leibniz, and Barrow Too: An Attempt at a Reinterpretation | year=1993| volume=84|page=310-338|journal=[[Isis (journal)]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] on behalf of [[History of Science Society]]}}(page 332)</ref></blockquote>

If you dig further into that cited passage, you will find references to [[Tom Whiteside| DT Whiteside]]<ref>{{cite journal| last=Whiteside|first=Derek Thomas| title=Patterns of Mathematical Thought in the later Seventeenth Century| url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/41133216.pdf| doi=10.1007/BF00327940| journal= Archive for History of Exact Sciences | volume=1|issue=3|publisher=[[Springer]]|pages=179-388|year=1961}}</ref> who argues this line of thinking. However, again, we are not discussing ''priority'' of the fundamental theorem, nor are we discussing ''originality''. What we are discussing is whether it is reasonable to infer that Gregory's work influenced Barrow, and given the in-depth analyses of these scholars (admittedly focusing on originality and priority for the fundamental theorem of calculus), it is hard to argue against, at the very least, the idea that Gregory's work did influence Isaac Barrow.

{{rfcquote|text=
With DC Comics' reintroduction of "Captain Marvel" as part of their "New 52" revamp in 2012, he was officially renamed "Shazam", a name that is used not only in the comics but in the character's subsequent appearances in other media. As a result, for the last four years, the lead and infobox for this article have been in a constant state of flux; I have seen each of the following as the lead sentence - back and forth - over the years:
:'''''Captain Marvel''', is a fictional superhero who appears in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]].''
:'''''Captain Marvel''', also known as '''Shazam''', is a fictional superhero who appears in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]].''
:'''''Shazam''', also known as '''Captain Marvel''', is a fictional superhero who appears in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]].''

The infobox has been in more of a state of flux than the lead - attempts have been made to acknowledge both names - i.e. "Shazam (Captain Marvel)" - in the header, but this again has been constantly edited back and forth, often without attribution. My proposal is that the infobox match whatever the choice for the lead will be, either ''"Captain Marvel"'', ''"Captain Marvel (Shazam)"'', or ''"Shazam (Captain Marvel)"''.

This is mostly the result of longtime fans being upset with the renaming of the character; a situation which doesn't appear to be all that reversible given [[Marvel Comics]]' increasing promotion and use of ''their'' [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] ([[Carol Danvers]]) in their comics and in an upcoming [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film. This was the key impetus for the name change in the first place.

This issue may also affect the naming of the article itself - that is, whether or not it needs to be renamed "[[Shazam (DC Comics)]]" or "[[Shazam! (DC Comics)]]". There also may need to be discussion about to do with [[Shazam (character)]], which redirects to [[Shazam (wizard)]], the article about the hero's wizard benefactor, as well as (eventually) the articles for [[Marvel Family]], [[Mary Marvel]] and [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]]. --[[User:FuriousFreddy|FuriousFreddy]] ([[User talk:FuriousFreddy|talk]]) 23:39, 6 June 2016 (UTC)}}

Some of the people who mill "influenced" aren't worthy. One individual who immediately comes to mind is Kruggy poo, aka Kruggsternator, aka Krugger, paul krugman.

:'''MANY''' of the people listed as "influenced aren't even in the 'second tier' (the last five on the list, for example)

this is getting ridiculous and embarrassing. is wikipedia being used as a way to help nobodies get opportunities they otherwise wouldn't? look at how long the list of "influenced" is! this is longer than [[John Stuart Mill]] who is also a giant. this list needs to be reduced, and to suggest that it doesn't is incorrect. i didnt make a fuss about someone changing the infobox back to "philosophy" because his supervisor [[Edward John Routh]] (a MATHEMATICIAN) was still acknowledged. what is with you "arts kids" on wikipedia? did Whitehead have some exceptional philosophical discourse? of course! however, he was a MATHEMATICIAN. look at some of these references for the "influenced" is hilarious (see reference "CPS Co-Directors", Center for Process Studies, accessed December 12, 2013, http://www.ctr4process.org/about/CoDirectors/. for [[Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki]]). 
:the number of people in this "influenced" box only insult the legacy that was supposed to be left for OUR GUY, the great whitehead. if this was that loser [[bertrand russell]]'s (caveat: i must admit his work was crucial to me "blossoming" though, as it ensured i was "nurtured" throughout my public K-12 education<ref>see [[Genius#Philosophy]]. "Russell's philosophy further maintains, however, that it is possible for such geniuses to be crushed in their youth and lost forever when the environment around them is unsympathetic to their potential maladaptive traits."</ref>), i wouldn't be making as much of a fuss. so can we get some cooperation in lopping off this list? it's way too long and unfair. as was mentioned by another individual in the [[Talk:John Stuart Mill]], many people were influenced by people like Whitehead or Mill. However, that doesn't mean they should all get equal mention. this list is outrageously long and only dilutes his impact.

There is general consensus that the text should not necessarily have its own section header on its own merits. While there is consensus for adding some information regarding this news item, the current text did not have consensus. To (grossly) generalise: While the references (such as The Washington Post) may have noted this information, the text in question does not show what the references state as to '''why''' they noted this information, so ''as written'' this appears to the reader as "trivia". So, while keeping policy ([[WP:BLP]], [[WP:V]], [[WP:OR]], etc.) in mind, there is no prejudice against starting a new RfC to determine what that text should be, and which section it should be grouped under (including the possibility of a whole new section, if deemed appropriate). Note: The arbcom restriction noted at the top of this page still applies, so initially [[WP:BOLD|boldly]] adding such text would likely be seen as disruptive and likely trigger sanction. - <b>[[User:Jc37|jc37]]</b> 09:19, 9 July 2016 (UTC)}}

Following a month long trial (9 May - 9 June inclusive) that was regarded as successful by most commenters based on objective and subjective measures (read this page for the full background), this RfC seeks to establish whether the criteria for the "Recent deaths" section of the "In the news" section of the main page, listed at [[Wikipedia:In the news#Recent deaths]] ([[WP:ITN/DC]]), should be changed to match those used during the trial.

'''Question:''' Should the proposal detailed below be implemented?
{{divbox|plain|Proposal|
'''The existing criteria for a recent deaths listing:'''
*The deceased was in a high-ranking office of power at the time of death and/or had a significant contribution/impact on the country/region.
*The deceased was widely regarded as a very important figure in his or her field.
'''are replaced by:'''<br />
The deceased has a Wikipedia article that is:
#Not currently nominated for deletion or speedy deletion.
#Of sufficient quality to be posted on the main page, as determined by a consensus of commenters.
}}
No other changes to the section at [[Wikipedia:In the news#Recent deaths section]] are proposed. These changes do not alter the criteria, standards or conventions for blurbs, including blurbs for people who have recently died.
 
If this proposal is successful it will apply to all nominations made from the UTC day after the RfC is closed (e.g. if this is closed on the 18 June it will apply from 19 June). [[User:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] ([[User talk:Thryduulf|talk]]) 12:32, 11 June 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
When an article is [[WP:PROD|proposed for deletion]], the PROD tag sits on the article and the article gets deleted after 1 week of no opposition. However, any editor who later disagrees with the deletion may [[WP:UND|request for undeletion]]. When an AfD discussion receives no comments after a week of being open, it is generally relisted to gain higher participation. Usually AfD discussions are relisted a maximum of two times, after which the discussion is usually closed as [[WP:SOFTDELETE]], meaning that any user may request for its undeletion without going through a [[WP:DRV|deletion review]]. Discussion venues such as [[WP:RFD]] and [[WP:RM]] follow [[WP:NOQUORUM]], in that nominations which have received no opposition after a week are deleted (in the case of RFD) or moved (in the case of RM). I cannot see why AfD should be treated differently from PROD. Generally speaking, AfD is monitored by more editors than PROD, meaning that an AfD uncontested after being opened for more than one week should have gotten more attention than an article which has been PRODed for a week. I propose that AfD discussions which have been open for more than a week (168 hours) without any "keep" votes (policy-based or not) be closed as soft delete, provided that the article has never been proposed for deletion or soft deleted in the past. This means that the article is deleted but any user, for any reason, may request for its undeletion at [[WP:UND]] instead of gaining consensus at [[WP:DRV]].

The article cites several sources that I would like some informed opinions on in the context of [[WP:RS]] in a [[WP:BLP]] article.  These seem problematic:

* "The Lordship of Castleshort" [http://home.earthlink.net/~rggsibiba/html/castleshort/castleshort.html] - And simple Earthlink site published by Shortt himself.  This makes it a [[WP:SELFPUBLISH|self-published source]], which normally are not acceptable (especially in this case; most other sources seem to show a lot of it is untrue)
*  "Ryoi Shintô Ryû Clubs Worldwide" [https://web.archive.org/web/20131112024747/http://www.rsrjujutsu.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=29] - Also seems to be a [[WP:SELFPUBLISH|self-published website]] by Shortt himself.
*  www.ibabodyguards.com - While this is an organization, it's also Shortt's business and it reads as though he either wrote it himself or at least has direct control over it's content, which would make it another [[WP:SELFPUBLISH|self-published source]].
*  "Irish Chiefswatch" [http://homepage.eircom.net/%257Eseanjmurphy/chiefs/chiefswatch.htm] and "Niadh Nask: An Alleged Irish Order of Knighthood" [http://homepage.eircom.net/%257Eseanjmurphy/chiefs/niadhnask.htm] - Both part of the [[WP:SELFPUBLISH|Self-published website]] of Sean J Murphy, an alleged genealogist (or something) who was allegedly threatened by Shortt.  He actually references Wikipedia and other wikis in the site.
*  The two [[Private Eye]] articles, "Soldiers of misfortune" and "A Shortt story" - Two problems.  1) There are no links to them and I cannot find them on Private Eye's site or anywhere else online. At present, I cannot verify what they said or if they even exist. 2) Prviate Eye is a ''satire'' magazine, somewhat like the American [[National Enquirer]], and so I am unclear if they are considered reliable sources in general.
*  The three [[The_Phoenix_(magazine)|Phoenix]] articles - same problems as Private Eye above, far as I can tell.
*  BudoExpress Interview - Can't find this anywhere.
*  The Dundalk Leader article - Can't find this anywhere either, not even a mention on a forum post.

[[User:Signedzzz]] has done some fantastic work on this page recently, pulling it up to GA status. However, I notice that there are still some significant omissions to the content; there is no section discussing Dilling's personal life or personality for instance, and no wider discussion of her political views or ideology. Moreover, the lead does not aptly summarise the rest of the article, as is required in [[WP:Lede]] (Contrast, for example, this article with that of other political figures like [[Else Christensen]] or [[Vladimir Lenin]]). Thus, this evening I have gone back to the reliable sources, and used them as part of a project to add these sections into the article and to ensure that on the whole it is more thoroughly sourced. 

Unfortunately, Signedzzz has simply undone almost all of my additions, often not giving any explanation in their edit summaries and barely responded to my Talk Page comments. In my opinion, this smacks of [[Wikipedia:Ownership of content|WP:Ownership]], which I think is completely unwarranted in this situation. I'm more than happy to work with them in improving the article, but at this stage I think it is best if I take it to RfC to see what other people have to say. Do I have a point?

I am making this request due to a discussion I initiated [[Talk:The_Phantom_Tollbooth#Plot_section_in-universe_problem|here]]. The discussion centered on whether the in-universe template should be applied to the article on the [[The Phantom Tollbooth]], which happens to be a featured article. My understanding of [[MOS:PLOT]] and [[MOS:INUNIVERSE]] is that the entire article, including in a plot summary section, should be written in an out-of-universe perspective, and therefore this article should be changed to fix this. To me, it seems that there are a few possibilities:
<ol> 
  <li>I am misinterpreting the plot summary in [[The Phantom Tollbooth]], and it isn't in the in-universe perspective.</li>
  <li>I am misinterpreting the guidelines at [[MOS:PLOT]] and [[MOS:INUNIVERSE]], and it is acceptable to write in an in-universe style, as long as it is within a plot summary section.</li>

The question asked above is valid and deserving of a valid answer. The talk page did not generate enough discussion to achieve that answer so this RfC is the next logical step. It is requested that participants read the level 2 discussion above for the entire background of this dispute. The request essentially asks: Should the [[WP:RS]] examples of plagiarism against Led Zeppelin be included in this article? If so, should that information be presented in its own section of the article? and is the article's current form which mentions plagiarism without specific details adequate?

given the recent addition by [[User:Look2see1]] of the categories "american x", i thought it'd be good to take this to the talk page.

can anyone provide some proof that Emmy Noether was an american citizen, not simply a resident who was there to teach?

i'm not disputing the possibility she was an american, but it just seems weird for someone to add those categories without proof. google's first few pages don't really turn up anything incontrovertible to support this idea, either.

hopefully those who are well-versed in this area can shed some light.

 Our current minimum for featured pictures is "a minimum of 1500 pixels in width and height" with some exceptions. Considering the continuing increases in the quality and size of digital photographs even from smartphone cameras, and the trend toward [[4K UHD]] (3840 x 2160) displays, should we make the following changes:
# increase the minimum size for still images to "3840 pixels x 2160 pixels ([[4K UHD]]), with the height and width interchangeable", and
# change the exception of "Animations and video may be somewhat smaller." to "Animations and video must be a minimum of [[full HD]] (1920 x 1080), with the height and width interchangeable. Exceptions to the minimum may be made for historical, technically difficult or otherwise unique images, if no higher resolution could realistically be acquired."?

The full set of revised size criteria would read:

"It is of sufficiently high resolution to allow quality print reproduction. 
* Still images should be a minimum of 3840 pixels x 2160 pixels ([[4K UHD]]), with the height and width interchangeable; larger sizes are generally preferred. Further information on image size can be found [[Wikipedia:Featured picture criteria/Image size|here]].

Hi! At the suggestion of [[User:Electricburst1996]], I'm requesting comment on edit number [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pendant_Productions&oldid=725565717 725565717]. As of current, there is an ongoing dispute between myself, {{ping|Spshu}}, and {{ping|Electricburst1996}} regarding this edit and our ongoing discussions about it can be read on our User Talk pages [[User_talk:Bmanpa#Pendant_Productions_issues|here]], [[User_talk:Spshu#Pendant_Productions|here]], and [[User_talk:Electricburst1996#Pendant_Productions|here]]. I'm seeking neutral insight into this situation to help us resolve the issue with cool heads.

Paramount to the discussion is an insistence by [[User:Spshu]] that the sources noted in the current revision do not constitute notoriety. It is my opinion that between [[BBC Radio 4]] coverage, a publishing deal with [[Valiant Comics]], several [[Parsec Awards|Parsec Award]] wins, and multi-million download numbers from a the early days of podcasting (When such things were more rare. The sources for this were removed by Spshu because they were Primary Sources.), notoriety is firmly established. His criteria of notoriety includes needing an abundance of coverage by major media (as opposed to New Media sources), which is not a standard being required of any Wikipedia pages of similar material, nor is it a guideline set forth in [[WP:PSTS]]. (Please see [[Earwolf]], [[Maximum Fun]], and [[Nerdist Industries]] for examples similar to this page.) 

As you can see in my edits from 14 June, I attempted to solve this problem by following the [[WP:UNDUE]] and [[WP:PRIMARY]] guidelines, but Spshu did not deem this sufficient and deleted much of the edit against the guidelines of [[WP:DR]]

Also of issue is the Infobox formatting, which is making use of < small > tags. Small tags are currently in use on Infoboxes for major corporate Wikipedia pages, including [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. Unless the formatting on those pages is incorrect, it appears his insistence over not using Small tags constitutes a personal preference (see [[WP:IDLI]]).--[[User:Bmanpa|Bmanpa]] ([[User talk:Bmanpa|talk]]) 02:13, 18 June 2016 (UTC)}}

On the page [[Disney Media Distribution]], a user just changed the type from type = [[Public company|Public]] [[subsidiary]] to type = [[subsidiary]] of [[The Walt Disney Company]]

I know that's wrong, since there's a separate field for parent, but I wanted to confirm what should be in the type field.  

The description page for [[Template:Infobox company]] describes the Type field as follows:

;Type of company, wikilinked where possible. To list percentages owned of a private company, use the ownership parameter (see below).
;Examples: 
;• [[Public company|Public]]
;• [[Privately held company|Private]]

So it's clear that the type can be public or private, but what are the other options?  It would be great to link the template to all the options.  There is a list here <nowiki>[[Category:Types of business entity]]</nowiki>, but the word Type in the [[Template:Infobox company]] infobox is wikilinked to the [[Types of business entity]] article.  That article doesn't really help users understand the type field.

Can we do two things: wikilink the description of the Type field in [[Template:Infobox company]] to <nowiki>[[Category:Types of business entity]]</nowiki>, instead of [[Types of business entity]], and change the wikilinking of the word Type in the [[Template:Infobox company]] template to go to <nowiki>[[Category:Types of business entity]]</nowiki>?  And, while we're at it, shouldn't entity be plural, since types is plural, i.e. Types of business entities?[[User:Timtempleton|Timtempleton]] ([[User talk:Timtempleton|talk]]) 19:26, 6 July 2016 (UTC)}}

Is this "black holes have no hair" statement related to the "hairy ball" observation?  A "hairy ball" (e.g. the physiscist's standard spherical vacuum-racing hamster) ''cannot'' have all of the hair smoothed down perfectly flat. In at least two points ("[[boojum]]s" if you'd like more physics-related neologisms) the hair must either come to either a radial point, or a point of extreme curl. As such points aren't observable from outside the event horizon, we can infer that there's no "hair" on a black hole, where this "hair" analogy can be extended to a number of forms of possible "texture" in its surface.

Hi there,

A few users and I are having trouble agreeing on the best photo to use as a portrait for Bernie Sanders's template.

It will often be displayed beside Hillary Clinton's portrait during the democratic nomination: Do the portraits of each candidate present them equally? The two portraits of Sanders, each presented in relation to Clinton's portrait, follow:

There seems to be some disagreement regarding discussion above about controversial coverage of the subject of this [[WP:BLP]]. Looking at the article, it seems that fully half of it is the controversy section, which does not appear to be in line with the spirit of [[WP:CSECTION]], and might be treading on shaky [[WP:NPOV]] ground.   

Unfortunately, I know basically nothing about the subject and so I'm opening this to hopefully attract some uninvolved editors who might be better qualified. Also posting a link on WikiProject:India. Feel free to post on other WikiProjects that might be related.

{{rfcquote|text=
Currently, biographical articles of knights and baronets begin with "Sir Firstname Lastname". Wikipedia convention dictates that the person's name at the beginning of a biographical article should be in bold. Most such articles (around 95%) bold "Sir" as well, but a minority of such articles do not bold the "Sir". It goes something like this:

'''Sir John Major''' (born 29 March 1943...
vs.

Sir '''John Major''' (born 29 March 1943...

I want to make it clear that this is not about renaming articles, but about the first mention of the subject's name in the body of the article.

I have been editing certain articles to bold "Sir" as part of the name. I do so for the following reasons:

1) This is the style prescribed by [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biographies]]. The relevant section reads as follows:
"The honorific titles Sir, Dame, Lord and Lady are included in the initial reference and infobox heading for the subject of a biographical article, but are optional after that. '''The title is placed in bold in the first use of the name.'''" (Emphasis added).

2) This is the logical style. "Sir" is part of a person's legal name: it is used not only socially, but in official documents as well. To not bold "Sir" is to imply that is is not part of the subject's name.

3) It is long-standing Wikipedia practice. As previously indicated, 95% of the articles surveyed so far bold "Sir".

I would also like to quote from the MOS, where it is stated that its purpose is to "achieving visual and textual consistency in biographical articles and in biographical information in other articles; such consistency allows Wikipedia to be used more easily". Hence, this is not a case of (say) preferring 'colour' over 'color', but is part of keeping a basic degree of consistency across articles so as to improve usability.

[[User:PBS]] is against the bolding of the prefix in articles' body and asked that I refrain from editing them until a consensus emerges. He will no doubt wish to set out his arguments below. We would be grateful for any comments editors might have on the subject.

is the choice of C really ''arbitrary''?

theoretically speaking, let us say we have a three dimensional euclidean space where each point in this space is independent of the other.
if we were to integrate or differentiate with respect to time, would one not want a unique constant C that essentially facilitate calculation using a two-dimensional approach (a la [[Lebesgue integration]])?
:let us say that we have some discretisation LxWxH (resulting in LWH independent points)
:if we had LWH primes, would these primes not also act as a sort of "unique key" (C) that would make it easier to integrate? 

i admit this but one obscure scenario, but it seems we would ''want'' the constant (ideally, systematically) selected such that it satisfies some rigorous conditions, no? 
probably gonna get mad crickets so w/e. thought i'd throw it out there. <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/174.3.155.181|174.3.155.181]] ([[User talk:174.3.155.181|talk]]) 03:22, 6 July 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serial_killer&diff=726283375&oldid=726213600 This edit] shows the dispute in question. One view is that beginning the lead with "three or more" violates NPOV, or, more specifically, [[WP:NPOV]]. This is based on the viewpoint that "three or more" is "inexplicably trying to declare, in the voice of the encyclopaedia, that a particular definition is correct." and that "As the article clearly states, there is no unique definition, and we have no business pretending there is.  Even if three is the most common, you do not have the right to state that as ''the'' definition."

The other view is that "the [[WP:NPOV]] policy is about [[WP:Due weight]]; it is about giving most of the weight to what is prevalent in the literature. On Wikipedia, it is common to give due weight to the most prevalent definition first, and then present alternative definitions." [[Atheism]] and [[Pedophilia]] are two examples. "Being neutral on Wikipedia does not mean what being neutral means in common discourse; it means following the sources with due weight." Use of "several" in this case is not accurate since "several" is commonly defined as "more than two but not many," when various serial killers have killed many. And "stating 'at least two' is giving undue weight to the 'two or more' definition, which is not as common as the 'three or more definition'."

For those seeing this from the RfC page or a talk page via an alert, full commentary can be seen at [[Talk:Serial killer#NPOV]]. Sources are also provided there. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 07:11, 21 June 2016 (UTC)}}

Hello, everyone.

I think a bold change by yours truly, and a couple of forth and back reverts by our esteemed colleagues {{u|Redrose64}}, {{u|JoeHebda}} and {{u|Moxy}} has very well demonstrated that we need to discuss this issue: Must {{tl|portal bar}} appear in "See also" section, or along with navboxes?

Argument in favor of "See also" section:
# That's where portal links, such as {{tl|Portal}} and {{tl|Portal-inline}} appear. Why should {{tl|Portal bar}} be exempt?

Argument in favor of navboxes section:
# Visually, {{tl|Portal bar}} fits better with navboxes
# Navboxes contain internal links strictly; but they don't appear in "See also" section either, in order to suppress the effects of link bombing.
# {{tl|Portal bar}}, like most navboxes, does not appear in the print, again for the same reason.
# Some navboxes, such as {{tl|Microsoft}} have portal links as well, so portals do not strictly appear in "See also" section anyway

hi guys, 

trying to improve this section but having trouble finding good sources. Rudin's functional analysis (chapter 4) isn't bad, but it's more about [[Banach spaces]] and [[dual space]]s.

it's possible one could "cobble together" a definition from Rudin's discussion, but i find it lacking. i tried finding a copy of [[Pavel Aleksandrov]]'s combinatorial topology (volume three seems really really nifty), to no avail.

wondering if anyone here has some good recommendations for books touching on functional analysis and duality? {{ping|Zfeinst}} (never thought i'd see this day, did you? lollll): got any good recommendations?

any advice would be great. right now this section is poorly sourced, and if i wasn't familiar with the concept (i learned them through [[Fenchel conjugate]]s), i would have put a request for deletion (exaggerating, sorta).

I'm boldly opening this RfC regarding the two threads above. I think at this point tensions have run high enough that a simple third opinion will be insufficient to establish a solid consensus to which either side will acquiesce.

The timeline being discussed can be seen above. It should be noted that the timeline has been on the article for a sufficient amount of time for it to become the status quo, and the question at hand as such, is whether the timeline should be removed, and not whether it should be included. Per [[WP:NOCON]], a lack of consensus for removal should normally result in the timeline remaining in the article.

I reckon that cases where subpages should not be moved are exceptional, whereas moving subpages is the routine expected behaviour. It's easy to overlook the relevant check box, especially when moving an article page where the only subpages are archives of its Talk page. Catching those archives after the fact can be burdensome and error-prone when there are many such subpages (see [[Talk:Syrian civil war]] for a recent case).
Therefore I suggest that the option labeled "Move subpages" or "Move subpages of talk page" should be checked by default. Opinions welcome. — [[User:JFG|JFG]] <sup>[[User talk:JFG|talk]]</sup> 09:29, 6 July 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The sexual harassment section of this BLP continues to be contentious on certain points.  Currently there seem to be 2 citations in question.  The first is to a blog article at Scientific American, where the Living Person (Karen Stollznow) made claims about sexual harassment.  That is the foundation of this section.  But Scientific American deleted that blog article shortly after publishing it without comment and it exists now only at internet archive.  So does that source still meet the BLP-level requirements for a reliable source, especially considering Scientific Amercican no longer stands behind it?

The second is a response citation to this article, where the head of the organization she accused gives his response.  Is that a self-published source, and does it meet the same requirements needed?

And finally, the whole section is basically about Stollznow making this claim, and the claim being denied.  There have been other links to court documents and twitter documents, which have been removed due to their ineligibility here.  So is what is left a reasonable item for this BLP?  Does the weak sourcing lean toward [[WP:BLPGOSSIP]] or [[WP:BLPCRIME]]? It would be great to get some other comments here!

Ever since the last RfC concluded Pop was going to be the genre, and the only genre for [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_(Taylor_Swift_album)&oldid=686351742 the current revision of Red], there have been numerous discussions, edit wars and complaints. Even though a lot of them were inaccurate (using the nomination for Best Country Album at the Grammy's or Swift claiming it's country as an argument), the essence of the rejection is in the right place, so I started a RfC. 

The genre of an album page on Wikipedia is not like iTunes, in which it is considered which genre section the album fits in best. It is supposed to give a good overview of the genres present on the album. I am not trying to change the genre from pop to country so I am not dismissing the previous RfC. However, I do think that country and rock should be added as genres to give a good overview of the actual content on the CD. Since pop will be the first genre, which usually indicates the genre most present on an album, it will still showcase a transition in comparison to the previous albums of Swift (going from Country to Country pop to Country pop • pop rock to Pop • country • rock to Pop • dance-pop • synthpop).

So should the current revision being kept or changed? [[User:Bjork138|Bjork138]] ([[User talk:Bjork138|talk]]) 20:20, 29 June 2016 (UTC)}}

hi guys,

want to put out a feeler for the appetite to merge [[separable sigma algebra]] into [[sigma algebra]]. i feel the former could be slotted in under a subsection of the latter.

hopefully this is not too radical? the page for separable sigma algebra is quite bare and i think merging into sigma algebra will improve its exposure.

thoughts? [[Special:Contributions/174.3.155.181|174.3.155.181]] ([[User talk:174.3.155.181|talk]]) 21:40, 29 June 2016 (UTC)}}

I think we need to stop arguing over the theoretical hierarchy of knowledge/authority, it is not source based and therefore cannot be used by either side to justify and back-up their argument. We need this discussion to be purely source based, state what a source actually states, not what a vague statement could mean. It is my view that DWM is very open to interpretation, but that is not source based, just like assuming who the official website is sourcing, we don't know who they are sourcing, but they are as reliable as a source can get and it is not open to interpretation, the official website has remained constant in their classification of episodes, whereas DWM has changed their view several times (one time (issue #489) they took a view which was not representative of official designation, referring to TGWD and TWWL as a two-parter), an indicating that it is more their opinion than actual fact, something with DWM is we don't know what Moffat said to them, for all we know they could be misinterpreting him, we can't be sure, while we have a statement from issue #493, that was before the episodes aired and Moffat was likely being purposely vague to keep people in the dark about the episodes, we don't have a post-broadcast statement from Moffat, issue #495 does not quote him, and therefore it cannot be used on the grounds that Moffat shares that view, even if he does, Moffat's personal opinion doesn't necessarily constitute official designation.

One concern is that "It should be very clear to readers that 'eidetic images' (in psychology) and 'photographic memory' are not the same things. Photographic memory does '''not''' exist, and eidetic images are generally not found in adults and they don't allow people to perform spectacular memory feats. [...] 'Eidetic imagery' in psychology is not 'photographic memory' -- it refers to the brief impression of an image that children sometimes see, and it has '''nothing to do with adults who memorize things'''. There is no science to support that." The other concern is that "'''most of the sources [...] are clear that the terms are used interchangeably''' or that photographic memory and eidetic memory '''are''' the same topic, but that the term ''eidetic memory'' is more accurate; if they distinguish photographic memory and eidetic memory at all, it's only slightly. In other words, sources usually treat these topics side by side and as the same thing while other sources distinguish them or slightly distinguish them."

So the issue is this: Should we be strict in stating that eidetic memory and photographic memory are not the same thing? Or should we should initially treat the terms as the same thing, with "photographic memory" as the [[WP:Alternative title]], and then relay that the terms are sometimes distinguished? Sources for examining the terminological matter are below. If viewing this from the RfC page or an alert on your talk page, the full discussion starts at [[Talk:Eidetic memory#Eidetic vs. photographic]].  I will alert [[WP:WikiProject Psychology]] and [[WP:Biology]] to this discussion.

While eidetic imagery is most likely the source of the concept of a photographic memory, there are differences in the two concepts. An eidetic image fades soon after one sees the original image and does not stay with a person over time. The image is subjective, and the details of greatest interest to the person are the ones most easily reproduced. Moreover, a person cannot form an eidetic image in one second, as a camera can snap a photo; several seconds are required to scan the picture. Once the picture has faded away, eidetic images cannot be retrieved. Those who can form eidetic images do not seem to be able to use their special ability to improve long-term memory.}}

'''  orphan article '''

Have linked him as notable alumni to schools and notable professor for Alliant with link backs.  Can't link to his high school at the current time because it is locked by an admin temporary. Will get with an admin to add him there and then will remove the tag of orphan article.  

''' proposed deletion by admin SwisterTwister asking for help on how to show this doctor is the head of his department, has chapters in textbooks used nationally and how to add research papers published. '''

Hello, I'm writing because as of today you put a tag on the article about Glenn S. Lipson saying the page should be deleted.  He is the director at Alliant University for the forensic psychologist dept. I placed that under Notable Alumni for Alliant University as well as what he works on that they put out as  Alliant Spotlights and wrote a whole summary of what he does and what he researches.  I also connected under Alliant his listing as the department head and his interests and research.  Each of the books listed that he contributed are text books.  He writes a lot of chapters in text books that are used nationally in other universities.  Any specific suggestions you can make as to showing all of this without using the PR release by Alliant University under their "spotlights" would be greatly appreciated.  

I was about to begin helping with other waiting psychologists pages waiting for help that needed to be added to Wikipidia but obviously I need to learn more of what is required first.  It was suggesting I not use links to his research papers because they weren't in text books and he did have chapters in multiple text books used today.

I' cross posting this on the talk page for my user page so I can get other help if you are busy this weekend.

Many thanks.

A request is hereby made for other editors to examine various points in dispute in the discussion above where two editors are deadlocked, and then determine, for each point, which view is persuasive, or whether additional argument is needed for resolution. Note that for [[#Item d: removal of "natural time" material as being fringe]] the precise issue is of notability.

(I caution any casual or fly-by commentators that some of these points involve scientific issues for which proper consideration requires examination of external sources; time spent on examination and consideration will enhance the quality of your comments.)

'''Background''': The discussion above concerns a series of edits being repeatedly made in two sections ([[Earthquake_prediction#Electromagnetic_variations]] and [[Earthquake_prediction#1987–1995: Greece (VAN)]]) that touch upon the group (and work) known as "VAN". (And related to similar edits at [[VAN method]].) These questioned edits are entirely from anonymous IP addresses that geolocate to Athens, Greece: first from [[Special:Contributions/195.134.89.153|195.134.89.153]] (and specifically from the University of Athens, home of VAN) and [[Special:Contributions/77.69.86.91|77.69.86.91]], then (since 5 June) from [[Special:Contributions/77.69.80.202|77.69.80.202]]. In general, I dispute these edits on the basis of neutrality, weight, and possible conflict of interest, while 77.69.80.202 complains that the existing text (as well as added text) was negative, "POV-pushing", and "muting" of support. ~ [[User:J.

So I guess we're ignoring wiki BRD policy on this page?  The unsourced assertion that assault rifles were first used in ww2 is not the consensus view, nor is the assertion that the germans were the first to pioneer the assault rifle concept during world war 2.  "The research led to an article published in the NRA Journal for the American Arms Collector, Man at Arms, (Vol. 13, No. 1, January/February 1991), titled The Burton Balloon Buster by William B. Edwards. Mr. Edwards emphatically asserted that this was indeed the first true assault rifle; developed in 1917. The father of this remarkable weapon was none other than Frank B. Burton, the noted engineer who worked with John Browning on the first BAR." http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=121   Other experts argue that the first was the federov avtomat.  There is no consensus among experts that assault rifles were first used in ww2, and there is no consensus among experts that germans were the first to pioneer the assault rifle concept.  I'd support a change to saying that the germans pioneered the sturmtruppen tactics in world war 2, and so it could be said that germany pioneered new tactics based around the assault rifle, sturmgewehr, but it seems like the germans pioneered sturmtruppen tactics at the end of world war 1.[[User:TeeTylerToe|TeeTylerToe]] ([[User talk:TeeTylerToe|talk]]) 11:06, 3 July 2016 (UTC)}}

hi guys,

i know on the surface this proposition may seem unrelated, but wouldn't satisfying properties of strict monotonicity also implicitly satisfy both the [[vertical line test|vertical]] and [[horizontal line test|horizontal]] line tests?

i understand in the case of non-strict monotonicity (i.e. strictly non-decreasing or non-increasing) can introduce a scenario where <math>t_1 < t_2</math>, and <math>f(x_{t_1}) = f(x_{t_2})</math>, thereby violating the horizontal line test, but couldn't we just patch the merged content accordingly?

just spitballin', of course. may help if we merge them into monotonicity under their respective sections, as it may help younger/newer mathematicians see what lies down the road (sorta?).

''' Background '''

[[WP:BLUELOCK|Extended confirmed protection]] (also known as "30/500 protection") is a new level of article protection that only allows edits from accounts at least 30 days old and with 500 edits. The automatically assigned [[WP:EXTENDEDCONFIRMED|"extended confirmed" user right]] was created for this purpose. The protection level was created following [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 129#New usergroup with autopromotion to implement arbitration "30-500" bans as a page protection|this community discussion]] with the primary intention of enforcing various arbitration remedies that prohibit editors under the "30 days/500 edits" threshold to edit certain topic areas. The [[WP:ARBCOM|Arbitration Committee]] recently [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee/Noticeboard/Archive 11#Arbitration motions regarding extended confirmed protection|passed a motion]] that established expectations for use of the protection within the scope of arbitration enforcement.

The protection policy currently states that extended confirmed protection may only be applied {{tq|in topic areas authorized by the Arbitration Committee or as a result of community consensus}} (per [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 129#New usergroup with autopromotion to implement arbitration "30-500" bans as a page protection|this discussion]]). However, it also states that {{tq|Criteria for community use have not been established.}} This request for comment seeks to establish such a community process for the use of extended confirmed protection. A [[Wikipedia:Village pump (idea lab)/Archive 20#Extended confirmed protection policy|discussion at the village pump ideas lab]] produced the following options.

''' Options '''

*'''Option A:''' Allow use only for topics authorized by the Arbitration Committee (current policy).
*'''Option B:''' Allow use only for topics authorized by the Arbitration Committee ''or'' for '''persistent sockpuppetry''' where semi-protection has proven to be ineffective (similar to what ArbCom [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee/Noticeboard/Archive 11#Arbitration motions regarding extended confirmed protection|stipulated]] for [[WP:AE|arbitration enforcement]] and [[WP:AC/DS|discretionary sanctions]] 30/500 applications). Notification is to be posted in a subsection of [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard|AN]] for review, unless the topic is already authorized for 30/500 protection by the Arbitration Committee.
*'''Option C:''' Allow use to combat any form of disruption (such as vandalism, edit wars, etc.) on any topic, given that semi-protection has proven to be ineffective. Notification is to be posted in a subsection of [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard|AN]] for review, unless the topic is already authorized for 30/500 protection by the Arbitration Committee.

Regarding the '''duration of the protection''', extended confirmed protection does not differ from semi or other forms of protection in that the duration is [[Wikipedia:Protection_policy#Guidance_for_administrators|proportional to the disruption observed]]. The one exception is topics authorized by the Arbitration Committee, which are often protected indefinitely.

For clarity, please support only one option. Supporters of option C may inherently support option B unless stated otherwise. <span style="color: #9932CC">[[:User:KrakatoaKatie|Katie]]<sup>[[User talk:KrakatoaKatie|talk]]</sup></span> 00:31, 4 July 2016 (UTC)}}

I am not happy with the RfC as proposed above, because it is the typical "let's dumb down the standard" phrasing that does not solve the problem of [[systemic bias]].  I'm rephrasing the problem: Two recent AfDs jump out at me as illustrative of Systemic Bias based on gender, race and national origin; far, far more  articles are proposed for deletion, and most of the arguments advanced are based upon a list of outcomes.   Where we have AfDs on minor pornstars being routinely kept because they "won an industry award", while women with doctorates and academic careers are routinely deleted as "not notable," we have a serious problem with the interpretation of WP:N.  
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alanna Shaikh]]
*[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kanwal Ameen]]
So this is my proposal:
*'''Shall WP:N include a section on how to assess issues of possible [[systemic bias]] in notability discussions?'''  
*Clearly, the devil is in the details, and this is '''not''' about "relaxing the standards," but rather it is about refining them so they do not exacerbate the problem of the legitimate systemic bias concern, which is sometimes expressed in articles about women being deemed "non-notable", particularly when the standards set for men often reflect their increased ability to gain promotion and recognition more than actual accomplishment or ability.

Is there fair justification for using this wording in instances that would result in the "Nazi-puppet state, ''so-called'' Independent State of Croatia (NDH)", in this article as well as the others? [[User:Otr500|Otr500]] ([[User talk:Otr500|talk]]) 15:55, 4 July 2016 (UTC)}}

Should the following content be included in this article:

{{bquote|In late June 2016, it was reported that Bill Clinton met privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on her private plane on the tarmac at [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]].  Officials indicated that the 30 minute meeting took place when Clinton became aware that Lynch's plane was on the same tarmac at the airport.  When the meeting became public, Lynch stated that it was "primarily social" and  "there was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body".  Lynch was criticized for her involvement in the meeting and was called on by some critics to recuse herself from involvement in the FBI's investigation of the email case.  In response, she stated "The F.B.I. is investigating whether Mrs. Clinton, her aides or anyone else broke the law by setting up a private email server for her to use as secretary of state," but "the case will be resolved by the same team that has been working on it from the beginning" and "I will be accepting their recommendations."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/us/politics/loretta-lynch-hillary-clinton-email-server.html|title=Lynch to Accept F.B.I.

As per all valid proofs, Kannada was, is and shall always be the native language of Hindupur. Native languages can't be changed by any amount of migration whatsoever just like native Americans are the natives of America and not English/Europeans and its speakers the natives of US. However during the linguistic reorganisation of states in India in the 1950s, Hindupur was retained on the wrong side of the border in Andhra Pradesh whose official language is Telugu and the official policy encouraged migration of Telugu speakers. Currently, Telugu may be widely spoken there, however, Kannada speakers still constitute about 50% of its population and all of them speak Telugu the official language with others outside. A famous Kannada scholar from Hindupur was Kallur Subba Rao. Kannada was the dominant language in Hindupur in the 19th and even in the early 20th century which started to change only in the latter half of 20th century. Native language, dominant or widely spoken language and official language are 3 different concepts. Hence, the demographics section of Hindupur will contain Telugu as the official and widely spoken language and Kannada as the native language of Hindupur as also its surroundings.

This RfC is to gauge community consensus about the preferred URL format for [[archive.is]] and [[WebCite]] when used in citations.

Both sites permit two URL formats, a shortened version and a longer version. Examples:

:;archive.is
:*<code>http://archive.is/YYYYMMDDhhmmss/http://www.example.com</code>
:*<code>http://archive.us/Gt56j</code>
:;WebCite
:*<code>http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.example.com&date=YYYYMMDD</code>
:*<code>http://www.webcitation.org/5eWaHRbn4</code>
:*<code> http://www.webcitation.org/5eWaHRbn4?url=http://www.example.com/</code>(used in dewiki, the ID contains a base 62 coded timestamp extracted by the template [[:de:template:Webarchiv]])

::(pretend they go to the same link)

Which one is preferred, or are either equally appropriate? 

Related information:

*The document [[Wikipedia:Using_WebCite|Using WebCite]] says "Either is appropriate for use within Wikipedia," while the document [[Wikipedia:Using_archive.is|Using archive.is]] says "The [longer] is preferred for use within Wikipedia because it preserves the source URI."
*During the archive.is RfC, some users brought up concerns short URLs can hide spam links, noting URL-shortening services such as [[bit.ly]] have been blacklisted from Wikipedia.
*A user at the German Wikipedia said they mandate long form because if the archive service went out of business, they would still know what the original URL was.
*Reverse engineering a shortened link to find the original URI can be done using the WebCite API, or web scraping in archive.is case.  
*WebCite and archive.is default to the shortened version when creating a new link or in page display.

'''Proposed:''' All articles created on or after October 1, 2016 must specifically cite at least one independent (non-affiliated) [[WP:RS|reliable source]] in support of at least one claim or assertion of fact within the article. Articles created after this date that do not cite any reliable sources may be proposed for deletion using the same procedure employed for [[WP:BLPPROD]]. For the purposes of discussion we may refer to the as yet to be created tag and guideline as [[VPROD]]. Any editor including the article creator, may remove the VPROD tag as soon as a single independent reliable source is added to the article. Reviewing editors and in particular New Page Patrolers are strongly encouraged to look for a reliable source before adding the VPROD tag, especially in cases where commonsense would suggest the likely notability of the subject. Ultimately however, it is the responsibility of the creator of the article and any editors adding material to ensure that all claims are properly referenced to reliable sources. Articles created prior to October 1, 2016 are not subject to VPROD, although they remain subject to the provisions of [[WP:V]] and may be nominated for deletion via [[WP:AfD]] if it is believed that they fail to meet minimal standards for sourcing.

'''OP's Statement''' There are simply too many unsourced articles out there and more are getting through all the time. WP:V is mocked by the existence of unsourced articles, and the credibility of the project is undermined. There aren't enough editors working on NPP as evidenced by the perpetual backlog. And while one would hope that they will try to fix deficiencies in articles they are reviewing, especially serious ones, the reality is that again there aren't enough of them to get every new article up to snuff without the entire system of review grinding to a halt. Yes, I know that one can always later send a problematic article to AfD but that is not a practical solution. AfD is already barely functional from a lack of participation. Articles sent there routinely languish for weeks without a !vote. We need to streamline the process and shore up WP:V. There is no reason why the same standard, which is shockingly minimal, that is applied to BLPs should not be applied to all articles. If requiring editors creating an article to cite just one source is too onerous then it is time to stop calling this an encyclopedia. In closing, I wish to say that I know this will be controversial. All I ask is that the discussion stay calm and polite. (And a support !vote would be nice too.) -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 00:53, 24 July 2016 (UTC)}}

We definitely do not need a bunch of [[WP:REDUNDANTFORK]]s on every possible spelling of this name (or any name), especially when most of it's just disambiguation "un-content" instead of real content, spelling varies widely even for the same historical subjects, there are many more such variants, and none of them are likely possible to develop into a real and properly sourced article on the name without combining them. <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 22:32, 10 July 2016 (UTC)}}

hi guys,

so i saw the wiki for [[pre-measure]] and it says the reason it's not a measure is because it's not defined on a [[sigma-algebra]].
: that part is cool.

however, it seems to me that the content is ''more'' of a "precursor" to a measure than a pre-measure.
: it seems content needn't be defined over a sigma algebra (hence a [[measure]] being a [[sigma-additive]] content), so wouldn't the content be more of a [[pre-measure]] since it's not in terms of [[ring theory]], but sets?

in the case where the content is not defined over a sigma algebra, surely there is some sort of way we could tie it in with [[pre-measure]]?
: i understand the latter is speaking in terms of rings, but so is [[Carathéodory's extension theorem]], which is a measure-theoretic concept that could bridge these ideas together?

both content and pre-measure are sigma additive, too. surely i'm not off my rocker (I HOPE?! ;)) ? ty in advance for the chat guys. [[Special:Contributions/174.3.155.181|174.3.155.181]] ([[User talk:174.3.155.181|talk]]) 20:34, 7 July 2016 (UTC)}}

As can be seen in the section "'Explicit consensus' is bogus", above (section 75 until something gets archived), this page is now being dominated by arguments over what the consensus of this talk page currently is (and was, previously). It would be helpful if some editors not previously involved in this debate could read through the talk page could read through it and offer an opinion on (1) current apparent state of consensus on this talk page (2) state of consensus of the talk page at the time of the edits [[User:Toto11zi|Toto11zi]] keeps complaining about (which I created sections 32 and 33 for the express purpose of discussing).

I started a full rewrite of the article. I cannot say I am really satisfied with the current result, and I would like to apologize for that - I thought I could get it done without using the sandbox, but I saw too big. Do share any opposition to the general philosophy of how the contents are dealt with though, even if the article will badly need a copyedit (but the former version was worse in that respect).

This article, [[Bombardier Movia & CNR Changchun C951]], attracted attention in light of the [[Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries_%26_CSR_Qingdao_Sifang_C151A#List_of_alleged_flaws_on_C151A|C151A scandal]] that broke a few days ago. As a result, there is now a requested move and removal of the phrase "Changchun" trying to remove all references to China. Personally I never liked the MRT rolling stock articles to be named this way as convention in WikiProject Trains follow the operator rather than the manufacturer, but it is a fact established by several sources that these trains are constructed by Changchun Bombardier Railway Vehicles, a joint venture by Bombardier Transportation and CNR Changchun.

This is a continuation of this thread at AN: [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Proper CSD tag for &#123;&#123;OTRS received&#125;&#125; but not confirmed.|Proper CSD tag for &#123;&#123;OTRS received&#125;&#125; but not confirmed.]]
Some background for those that don't want to wade through the AN thread. I have been going through the old images at [[:Category:Wikipedia files with unconfirmed permission received by OTRS]], double checking the permissions ticket, and if the ticket has not been resolved I have been marking them for deletion. The current CSD criteria only mentions OTRS once and that is in [[WP:F11]]. However, this mention uses {{tl|OTRS pending}} not {{tl|OTRS received}}. The two are different. Pending is when the ticket has been said to have been sent but has not been reviewed by an agent. Received means the ticket ''was'' reviewed but did not contain enough information to {{tl|OTRS permission}} the image.
Images that I have been marking for deletion have been sitting, waiting for a response, for well over a month. This is the cutoff that Commons uses (see [[c:template:OTRS received]]) and that is plenty of time to work out the permissions once responded to by an agent.
So the question here is, what criteria should these images be marked under for deletion? Since the policy of CSD is rather strict, this needs to be worked out in order to make the processing of these images easier for everyone. Two main options here. F9 or F11. F11 has the further caveat that normally it has a 7 day delay with it. So if F11, with or without the extra week notice? <u>If you support F11 please indicate whether it should have an additional 7 day waiting period or not as well.</u> The other option would be to just use {{tl|db}} with a custom rationale and do away with the letter + number scheme for these images. --[[User:Majora|Majora]] ([[User talk:Majora|talk]]) 18:08, 7 August 2016 (UTC)}}

hi guys,

given that the generation of the regular borel measure is among the central objects of study in [[measure (mathematics)|measure theory]], and the fact that one can start with a primitive notion ([[set theory]]) to build a content, which then can generate such a measure, i was hoping we could start some discussion on tidying up some pages.
: i dislike definitions of measures that start without a primitive notion, as it defeats the purpose of the simplicity that measure theory is supposed to exploit.
:: this specific page (borel regular measure) is so brief i suspect there won't be much argument if we can merge it into [[content (measure theory)]]. however, i thought it was a useful example of a page that's not really helpful (no details on construction etc).

having read Halmos' (beautiful) construction of a borel measure from a content, which is then used to build the theory of [[Baire measure|Baire measures]] and [[linear functionals]], i feel that we need to have a discussion on how we can combine a bunch of these pages.
:i do not think the likes of [[Constantin Carathéodory]] thought there would be more than one way to define a measure (aside from things like a [[Gaussian measure]], which is the analytic form resulting from measuring "true nature"). 
:: [[Carathéodory's extension theorem]] is a very intimidating proof, but its beauty lies in the fact it can extend the appropriate definition (such as the one given by Halmos) into a Lebesgue measure. 
::: concepts relevant to this proof, such as set cover, enable us to exploit the [[Hasse principle]] (global-local principle) to procure such a measure 
:::: think of a unit sphere centred at each point in space; the natural overlap between adjacent points' spheres ("connected") provides fertile ground to apply Caratheodory's extension theorem. not saying it's published, but it has been done and known for quite some time.

being someone who considers himself a (seasoned, mind you) novice in this intimidating area of [[mathematical analysis]], some of these definitions seem superfluous (inner regular, outer regular, etc). 
:i accept that there are few resources to help fix these issues, but i thought i'd throw out my own view of some of these pages.

i am not trying to disparage contributions from mathematicians like [[Johann Radon]] and the likes, who have all tried to further develop this challenging line of thinking initiated by [[Henri Lebesgue]], [[Hermann Minkowski]] and his student [[Constantin Carathéodory]]; rather, i am just trying to point out the fact that measure theory was *always* focused on *measuring* in the real world. 
:i plan to start reading Caratheodory's exposition that propounds a measure-theoretic approach to thermodynamics after i click "save page", but i suspect this work will directly support my previous sentence (although he is just one person, he is Constantin Caratheodory...).
::i have belaboured the point that any numerical analysis purporting to use measure theory must demonstrate their construction starting from a primitive notion (sets), which are the foundation that later results are built on (see halmos).

you guys may disagree and shut down my line of thinking, which is fine, but i thought i'd throw it out there as i've noticed a lot of fragmentation. thanks [[Special:Contributions/174.3.155.181|174.3.155.181]] ([[User talk:174.3.155.181|talk]]) 22:02, 10 July 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The purpose of this section is to request opinions about this question:

'''Should the article make assertions about what is "currently" true with regard to record closing highs and/or intraday highs?'''  ("currently" meaning whenever a reader happens to read it).

Background info:  The article was edited (by an IP editor) on 15 July 2016 to add such an assertion.  This led to a series of edits and Talk page commentary, including the above comment from OwenX, "If you're going to edit that section, update it to the current numbers".

My opinion on the aforementioned question is "'''no'''", and I invite other opinions and reasons.  My reasons are as follows:
* Upon cursory review of past versions of the article, it appears that prior to 15 July 2016 there was no precedent that the "Price history" section made assertions that any past record highs noted in the article are still current in the present moment (that is, the moment when a reader reads the article).  In the absence of strong arguments to change, my inclination is to follow past precedent.
* Making statements about the "current" record high would place a burden on the editors to update that information whenever the record high changes.  In the absence of any editors who are established as being committed to the task of keeping it updated, we have a situation where readers will see the article frequently containing a false statement (that something is a "current" record high when it is not).
* While I am aware that many articles make assertions about what is true currently ("The current President of the United States is...", "The current capital of Japan is..."), those are things that don't change very often, and in those cases, assertions about what is current will likely be inaccurate for only minutes (or hours) over a period of many years, and very infrequently.  Stock indexes, on the other hand, might reach new record closing highs on a daily basis during steady bull markets, and reach new intraday highs minute-by-minute, meaning that assertions about "current" stock index record highs have a far higher likelihood and frequency of becoming out of date as the facts change, compared with those other kinds of events.
If there winds up being a consensus that the article should, in fact, make this kind of assertion, then my further suggestion would be to put it in a separate section or subsection called something like "Current record highs".  This would make it easier for readers to understand where to find accurate current information (as opposed to historical information, which is what "Price history" seems to imply), and also alert editors to the need for timely and vigilant attention to that section.

Again, my opinion on the above question is "no", for the above-mentioned reasons, and I invite other opinions and reasons.  Thanks.  -- [[User:HLachman|HLachman]] ([[User talk:HLachman|talk]]) 05:47, 28 July 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I have a question which I'd like to raise for discussion, about a potential conflict between [[WP:NMEDIA]] and actual practice. 

Officially, NMEDIA confers notability on a radio station only if it meets ''both'' of two conditions: possessing a broadcast license and having an established broadcast history (i.e. actually operating). In practice, however, WPRS has frequently looked the other way on the second condition, allowing an article about a proposed but not yet launched radio station to stand as soon as its license approval or "construction permit" is granted.

There's an example of the limitations of this approach unfolding in [[Montreal]] right now, where a company called TTP Media was granted three licenses in 2013 for stations on [[600 AM Montreal|AM 600]], [[850 AM Montreal|AM 850]] and [[940 AM Montreal|AM 940]] — as of June 19, however, the 850 license has expired unbuilt, and while 600 and 940 are technically still active licenses, they're also both still unbuilt as of today and will expire in November if they haven't been launched by then. Furthermore, apparently Montreal's established news media have been able to find ''no'' discernible indication of TTP engaging in the amount of corporate activity that would have to be happening right now in order to ''get'' two radio stations launched by November. So, while acknowledging that [[WP:CRYSTAL]] prevents me from stating anything ''definitive'' yet, the balance of ''probabilities'' at this point is that ''none'' of the three stations is actually going to launch. Accordingly, I've already had to nominate 850 for deletion, and while for the moment I'm waiting for it to become official in the case of 600 and 940, they're ''likely'' to have to be deleted in the fall as well.

This, then, is my question: should WPRS continue to permit articles about stations that have been licensed but not yet launched, and then target the ones that expire unbuilt for deletion only after they expire, or should we take NMEDIA more seriously by cracking down on articles about unlaunched stations, and switch to restricting them to draftspace until such time as they ''actually'' launch?

The article on Hamilton states that she coined the term "software engineering" and it now cites three webpages.  I noted on the talk page that authoritative paper encyclopedias disagree with that.  Twice I put the "dubious" tag on it, but they were removed by the same person, without adequate discussion or consideration.

According to ''Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology'', entry on software engineering, Edwin Reilly states that the term was coined at the NATO conference in Brussels in 1968.  He says that participant and historian Brian Randall believes that the term came from Fredrich L. "Fritz" Bauer. 

The ''Encyclopedia of Computer Science'', by Anthony Ralston and Edwin Reiley, third edition, says that the term first appeared at NATO conferences in 1968 and 1969, but in Germany and Italy.  They cite Naur, Randall, and Buxton, editors of "Software engineering: Concepts and Techniques", ''Proceedings of the NATO Conferences'', 1976. 
 
Whether or not Hamilton coined the term "software engineering" needs to be addressed.  [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] <sup>[[User talk:Bubba73|You talkin' to me?]]</sup> 18:34, 15 July 2016 (UTC)}}

As Anderson Lawler was Gary Cooper's closest friend in the early 30s, and a significant person in his life, it is proposed to include the following two sentences in the article: '"In 1929 Cooper met the aspiring Paramount actor Anderson Lawler, with whom he lived with for a year. Popular and unabashedly homosexual, Lawler introduced Cooper to Hollywood society, but their close friendship caused intense jealousy with Clara Bow and Lupe Velez."' Citation would be: Mann, William J. Behind the screen: how gays and lesbians shaped Hollywood, 1910-1969, Viking, 2001, pp105-11 Note: Lawler's homosexuality is referred to because (a) it was widely noted in Hollywood at the time and (b) the friendship with Cooper was frowned upon by some contemporaries for that fact (see citation for both points), but this RfC is only for discussing the proposed inclusion.

I am asking for comment regarding recent edits made by [[Special:Contributions/Gonzales John|Gonzales John]] ([[User talk:Gonzales John|talk]]). My main concern is that the edits appear to violate the neutrality of the article. The use of phrases such as "Christ myth theories are, in the modern age, not taken seriously by virtually all competent scholars" and "a person who believes the Christ myth theory is generally taken lowly by experts", coupled with the elimination of more than 20,000 bytes of referenced material as "excess info" and "undue weight" (quoting directly from edit summaries) and earlier revisions describing this as a "conspiracy theory" lead me to believe that this editor has a non-neutral agenda they wish to impose. 

I have asked Gonzales John to please refrain from making such edits and instead bring their concerns to this Talk page.

I'm raising an RfC question about the appropriateness of including information about a subject's stalker in a biography, in all cases. I see two issues:

* Second, are we inflicting low-value trivia on the reader, if there is no unusual or noteworthy content to relate, beyond the basic existence of a stalker?
The alternative POV is that including stalker info is generally appropriate, based on precedent and custom.

{{rfcquote|text=
After the end of foreign combat operations in Iraq, there were numerous discussions on this talk page as to whether the article should reflect the "conclusion" of the "Iraq War" or whether it should treat the conflict as "ongoing" past that point. The prevailing viewpoint was that, according to reliable sources, the terminology "Iraq War" referred to the 2003-2011 multinational, US-led military conflict within Iraq. In other words, while various conflicts continue to this day, "the Iraq War" had ended.

Recently, a handful of editors reached a questionable local "consensus" to fundamentally change the subject of the article; ''Iraq War'' would now be an umbrella article for ''all'' conflict in Iraq since the 2003 invasion. I've done some research and have come to the conclusion that the reliable sources ''still'' do not reflect the notion that the "Iraq War" is ongoing, and thus the article should not do so. Sources discussing the ''ongoing'' conflict no longer use the terminology "Iraq War", and sources that ''do'' use the term are specifically referring to the concluded multinational conflict of 2003-2011. I can't find anything that indicates that "Iraq War" should refer to ''all'' conflict since 2003, nor do I think the input in the last discussion was ''remotely'' enough to change the fundamental subject of a prominent and controversial article. It should require a stronger consensus, with more input, and [[WP:RS|hard evidence]], to make such a drastic change.

We should change it back to the previous stance, based on the fact that it was supported by reliable sources, or we should have a stronger consensus to the contrary.

===Statement of the problem'''

OK. This is complicated so bear with me (or just skip straight to the Proposal section). Let's fix this long-term bleeding wound. The documentation for this template says
:''{{xt|This template is meant for pull quotes, the visually distinctive repetition of text that is already present on the same page.}}
But this is nonsense, and in fact nobody -- and I mean, literally, nobody -- uses this template for that reason. 

"Pull quotes" are a technique used by by magazines to spiff up the layout. You "pull" a interesting section of text from the body of the article and highlight it by repeating in a box or whatever with a bigger font so so forth.

But an encyclopedia has no use -- literally no use -- for pull quotes in this sense. We are not a magazine. ''Repeating'' text in this way will only confuse the reader, and that is why it is never done. By "never done", I mean that in my 10+ fully active years here I have never seen it done even once. And I challenge the reader to look at ''n'' instances if "what links here" for {{tl|Pull quote}}, and I expect you will find zero instances of {{tl|Pull quote}} being used for actual "pull quotes" for any value of ''n''. I know I have, expanding ''n'' until I was overcome with boredom. All instances -- ''all'' instances -- of {{tl|Pull quote}} are used for normal quotes, in the same way {{tl|Quote}} and {{tl|Quotebox}} are used.

And if, by chance, you should find one instance of {{tl|Pull quote}} being used for it's supposed use of actual pull quotes, I suggest you consider editing the article to remove this, since repeating material in this manner is only going to confuse the reader, probably. This is why the second sentence of the documentation is (properly) {{xt|"In most cases, this is not appropriate for use in encyclopedia articles."}} which someone shoehorned into the text describing ''how to use it in articles'', which makes quite a dog's breakfast of the documentation and BTW renders this useful and attractive template with essentially no earthly use.

(But look, I'm open minded: it's not ''impossible'' that some use for pull quotes could be found. I guess. I can't think of any, but I guess you never know. Anything's possible I suppose. If such an unlikely circumstance should arise someday, we could then either create a new template for this unique situation, or -- more likely -- just let the editor use one of the existing quote templates (cquote, rquote, quote, quotebox, or whatever else we have)).

OK? With me so far? There's no use for pull quotes in this encyclopedia, evidenced by the the fact that there are ''are'' no pull quotes, or practically none, and indeed the second sentence of the documentation says just that.

OK, so then why not just ''delete'' this template? Well, because ''it's attractive and useful''. I use it all the time and recommend that you do also. To my mind it's far superior to {{tl|quote}}, which highlights quotes just by indenting them, which (to my mind) is confusingly insufficient to separate them from the normal text (especially when there are lots of thumbnail pictures or other formatting geegaws, when you can substitute "insufficient" with "completely useless"). I don't like to use {{tl|quote}} because in a lot of instances it's just not at all clear that we are shifting from normal article text to a quotation, and it's confusing to the reader IMO.

But then there is {{tl|quotebox}}, which puts an ASCII-type box around the quote, which is fine -- if you are editing in 1986. I'm not. We used to put ASCII boxes around text in our [[MS-DOS]] programs and we thought we were the bee's knees. It was cool then. It's not now. If disco comes back we can talk about reviving {{tl|quotebox}}. Until then, it's horribly ugly and archaic looking.

But hey. I'm OK with people using {{tl|quote}} and {{tl|quotebox}} if they want. Let a thousand flowers bloom. For my part, I've been using {{tl|cquote}} and {{tl|rquote}} for quotes, with their at least ''somewhat'' sporty large quotation marks, for like ten years now, with no objections and no problems. So have lots of other editors, according to the "what links here here" results.

So I changed the documentation to reflect this (a while back) and an editor objected, so here we are with this RfC which should, to my mind, be open-and-shut. Even if you don't agree with ''me'', you ought to agree that rules should document actual practice, not what some editor thought ''should be'' actual practice ten years ago. 

In one sense it doesn't matter. People are (sensibly) not going to put pull quotes in article, and (sensibly) are going to use to {{tl|cquote}} and {{tl|rquote}} for normal quotes. In another sense, it would make sense to have the documentation reflect this use; probably some editors have been dissuaded from using this functional and useful template because of the incorrect documentation.

'''Proposal'''

*1) Move "Template:Pull quote" to "Template:Cquote", and move "Template:Reduced pull quote" to "Template:Rquote". (These pages already exist as redirects).
*2) Change the documentation for {{tl|Cquote}}. Remove this material from the beginning of the documentation:
::''{{xt|This template is meant for pull quotes, the visually distinctive repetition of text that is already present on the same page. In most cases, this is not appropriate for use in encyclopedia articles. The Manual of Style guidelines for block quotations recommend formatting block quotations using the {{tl|Quote}} template or the HTML <nowiki><blockquote></nowiki> element, for which that template provides a wrapper. Pull quotes work best when used with short sentences, and at the start or end of a section, as a hint of or to help emphasize the section's content. For typical pull quotes, especially those longer than the rest of the paragraph in which they are quoted, {{tl|Pull quote}} provides a borderless quote with decorative quotation marks, and {{tl|Quote frame}} provided ''[sic]'' a bordered quote. Both span the article width. For very short pull quotes, {{tl|Reduced pull quote}} (with decorative quotation marks) or {{tl|Quote box}} (framed) can be used to set the quote off to either the right or left as in a magazine sidebar. This can be effective on essay pages and WikiProject homepages. -- Usage -- For actual pull quotes, this template provides a centered, borderless pull quote, with scalable decorative quotation marks, and optional attribution of the source of the quote. It can be used with or without the names of the parameters.}}''
:and replace it with this:
::''{{xt|{{tl|Cquote}} adds a block quotation to an article page. It is similar to {{tl|Quote}}, but more decorative in that it adds a set of large (but scalable) quotation marks, at the beginning and end of the quoted text, around a centered, borderless quote, and optional attribution of the source of the quote. It can be used with or without the names of the parameters. In all other ways it is similar to {{tl|Quote}}, and may be used in place of {{tl|Quote}}, at the editor's discretion. See also {{tl|Rquote}} for when it is desired to include a short quote which does not span the width of the paragraph.}}''
*3) And make similar changes to {{tl|Rquote}} to match this.
*4) And make the following changes to [[MOS:BLOCKQUOTE]] (which is the "Block quotations" section of the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style]] (MOS)). Change this sentence
::''{{xt|Do not enclose block quotations in quotation marks (and especially avoid decorative quotation marks in normal use, such as those provided by the {{tl|pull quote}} a.k.a. {{tl|cquote}} template, which are reserved for pull quotes).}}''
:to
::''{{xt|{{tl|Cquote}} and {{tl|rquote}} are alternatives to {{tl|quote}} which enclose the block quotation in large quotation marks.}}''

Should reliably sourced content that demonstrates the "Healther Hoax" is based on manipulated photos and videos be kept or deleted? Specifically, the following passage which has been repeatedly blanked (cites removed for ease of reading but viewable here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conspiracy_theories_of_the_United_States_presidential_election,_2016&oldid=735952856]): 
{{cquote|Several videos and photographs were manipulated, or taken out of context, by conspiracy theorists to support claims of Clinton's alleged health issues, including: 
* A [[Getty Images]] photograph from February 2016 showing Clinton being helped by two men to ascend a flight of stairs. The rumor-examination website [[Snopes.com]] concluded that the August 2016 claim was a "mixture" of truth and falsehoods, noting that the photograph was "genuine" but "not recent," as it had been taken back in February. The Getty Images photograph also had a caption that stated that Clinton merely "slipped while [she] walked up stairs in South Carolina."
* A June 10, 2016, video posted to YouTube showing Clinton at a campaign stop in which it appears she turns her head back-and-forth vigorously for several seconds. In fact, the video was manipulated to loop a much shorter Clinton head turn to create the appearance of a [[spasm]].
* An early August incident where a Clinton speech was disrupted by protesters and in which a man approached Clinton, who had paused, and reassured her that the situation was under control. Though some conspiracy bloggers alleged the man to be a [[neurologist]], it was later confirmed he was in fact Secret Service Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Todd Madison.}} [[User:LavaBaron|LavaBaron]] ([[User talk:LavaBaron|talk]]) 07:14, 24 August 2016 (UTC)}}

'''1.''' Should (a) out-of-circulation currency and (b) stamps issued for mass circulation as currency, be admitted as notable and their non-free images used in visually topical articles such as [[Federal Reserve note]], [[United States five-dollar bill]] and [[Puerto Rico on stamps]] when accompanied with the applicable image templates?

:Support would be a step toward permitting the continued informal exemption allowed for national currency and extend it to allow for USPS stamps.

'''2.''' Should NFCC#8 be amended to read, "Contextual significance. Non-free content is used only if its presence would significantly increase readers' understanding of the article topic, and its omission would be detrimental to that understanding. ''Publisher descriptions of currency and stamps issued for mass circulation as currency is sufficient for contextual significance when used along with applicable image templates''.”?

:Support would provide a formal consistent exception for national currency and stamps issued for mass circulation as currency such as USPS stamps. 

* After some lengthy discussion at the Village Pump and [[Wikipedia talk:Non-free content/Archive 66#USPS image use]] over the criteria to allow non-free images of USPS stamps at [[Puerto Rico on stamps]], seven editors were unable to arrive at a consensus on the NFCC and NFCI requirements as currently written, or whether an amendment of NFCC#8 were required. The editors were [[User|TheVirginia Historian]], [[User|WhatamIdoing]], [[User|SMcCandlish]], and [[User|Hammersoft]] for exemption of currency and stamps issued for mass circulation as currency, [[User|Masem]], [[User|Seraphimblade]], and [[User|Diego]] in the minority against. 

'''Proponents''' noted that 11 of the top 25 articles with the most use of non-free images are currency articles. We already have two stamp articles on that same top 25 list. The USPS as a governmental agency may not be competent to copyright its stamps at all. Non-free use of USPS images should be allowed in visually topical articles when they are accompanied with the [[Template:Stamp rationale]] whenever a free use alternative to the stamp image does not exist of the USPS stamp itself. As it explains at [[WP:NFCI]]#3, currency and stamp images may be used for identification of the stamp or currency, not the subjects depicted on it. WP:NFC#UUI#9 justifies use of the stamp image if placed inline next to the commentary, because the stamp itself is the subject of sourced discussion in the article. Just using prose does not replace the visual information found in the image. The Foundation allows exceptions to its non-free use policy at [https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Licensing_policy Foundation licensing policy]. The informal exemption for currency is arbitrarily administered in the case of currency, and results in wholesale deletion of USPS images without discussion on stamp related pages. In the case of [[Puerto Rico on stamps]], it results in removal of over half the US stamps issued about Puerto Rican personalities, places, events in American culture. 

'''Opponents''' held that stamps are not the same as currency, currency can be informally permitted as non-free use images without formal exception because there are fewer notes. Out of circulation notes and coins may or may not be exempted in the future depending on administration of the NFCC by interested editors -- they are allowed without policy, they may be removed without policy. Contextual significance for stamps is found only by scholarly commentary of the art pictured on the stamps, not the stamps themselves, but currency is exempted. While mass circulated currency is informally exempted without policy justification, only images of stamps with printing errors achieve notoriety sufficient for inclusion at WP. These may be exempted, as well as stamps with out-of-copyright art pictured, and the USPS fine art series with USPS fine arts series descriptions of the stamp art. One or two USPS images can always be used in each stamp related article to suggest their existence since 1978. If exemptions are allowed for currency and stamps issued as currency, it will open the floodgates allowing every non-free use image everywhere throughout WP, violating the Foundation admonition to use few of them. 10:08, 28 July 2016 (UTC)}}

Alright so, the RfC above with withdrawn after it became [[WP:SNOW|pretty clear]] that the correct tag for these types of images is F11 as the default. Now the question is whether or not the additional 7 day waiting period should be applied for these types of images. Note, it does not matter that the ''current'' F11 version does not include a type of "immediate F11". This is a question on whether or not the F11 criterion should be amended. The current practice with these images is for the permission holder to send in the proper permissions to OTRS. If the email has been reviewed by an agent but deemed not sufficient the image is tagged with {{tl|OTRS received}}. After 30 days the ticket should be rereviewed by an agent and if no valid permissions has been received the image will be tagged F11.

== Speedy deletion criteria for books '''

I know that there has been talk about creating a speedy deletion criteria for books, but there's never really been any true consensus on this. I think I might have come up with something that could potentially be doable. My thought is that this would fall under [[WP:A9]] for the most part, as that one of the main things I drew from, but it could potentially be a new criteria on its own.

The basic gist of this criteria is that it would only apply to books that are published through vanity or self-publishing outlets like AuthorHouse, Smashwords, and CreateSpace, where the books do not make a credible assertion of notability ''and'' the author/contributor(s) do not have an article. This would allow us to quickly get rid of the obviously non-notable stuff like some random self-published book by a non-notable author without having to go through a full AfD. There are too many articles that have to go through a full AfD, despite being so obviously non-notable that there's not even a question that they'll be deleted. This criteria would also apply to fanfiction posted to places like FanFiction.net, so that we don't have to have to bring something like [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/FASTLANE(Zootopia)|this]] to AfD because fanfiction doesn't always cleanly fit into web content. I've included podcast novels in this since that's sort of akin to self-publishing, but I'm fine with that portion being removed since it's a bit of a grey area publication-wise.

The criteria would not cover any book that is published through a large, indie, academic, or small press. It would also not cover the deletion of any book where the author has an article, nor where any credible assertion of notability is made. This assertion would be considered to be things such as coverage in a RS (a [[WP:TRIVIAL|trivial]] mention would suffice as long as the source is a RS), assertion of bestselling status, the book being adapted into a film/TV show/game, or a major award - the typical type of stuff that admins consider when judging [[WP:A7|A7]] deletions. I am thinking about making the age of the book part of this criteria - if the book was published prior to 2000, it would not qualify under this criteria. People could self or vanity publish prior to this point of time, of course, but it was harder to do so and slightly more rare than it is nowadays. That would keep us from instantly deleting a book from say, the early 1900s or earlier, as there's the possibility that the book ''could'' be notable. I chose 2000 based on the date in the [[self-publishing]] article that stated that the 2000s were kind of a turning point as far as self-publishing goes. We could probably go later if anyone wanted, but I think that 2000 is a decent option that would cover the majority of self-published and vanity works without being too inclusive or exclusive.

Here's my mockup of the basic guideline, but feel free to suggest tweaks and alterations. 

:::''No indication of importance (books).''

:::''This criteria applies to any book that is either self-published or a vanity printing after 2000 and does not give any indication where the work is important or significant and where the author or contributors' article does not exist (all criteria must be true). Fanfiction and podcast novels would qualify under this criteria if there is no assertion of notability and the author does not have an article. This is distinct from questions of verifiability and reliability of sources, and is a lower standard than notability. The criterion does not apply to any article that makes any credible claim of significance or importance even if the claim is not supported by a reliable source or does not qualify on Wikipedia's notability guidelines. The criterion does apply if the claim of significance or importance given is not credible. If the claim's credibility is unclear, you can improve the article yourself, propose deletion, or list the article at articles for deletion.''

;;;'''With new changes suggested by Graeme and Kevin''' (Updated again)
:::''This criterion applies to any book that is published to the self-publishers or vanity publishers CreateSpace, AuthorHouse, Smashwords, Lulu, Leadstart Publishing, or the publisher is the same name as the author after the year 2000 and does not give any indication where the work is important or significant and where the author or contributors' article does not exist (all criterion must be true). Fanfiction and podcast novels would qualify under this criterion if there is no assertion of significance and the author does not have an article. This is distinct from questions of verifiability and reliability of sources, and is a lower standard than notability. The criterion does not apply to any article that makes any credible claim of significance or importance even if the claim is not supported by a reliable source or does not qualify on Wikipedia's notability guidelines. The criterion does apply if the claim of significance or importance given is not credible. If the claim's credibility is unclear, you can improve the article yourself, propose deletion, or list the article at articles for deletion.''

My basic thought is that this is kind of overdue, given that anyone and their mother can put out a work through a vanity or self publisher nowadays. Again, this wouldn't cover anything put out through regular publishing arms or anything with even a remotely viable claim of assertion. 

I'm going to ping the following editors, who were active during the bestseller as notability conversation at [[WP:NBOOK]], are still reasonably active, and are editors that I'm fairly familiar with. {{ping|AngusWOOF|DGG|Coolabahapple|James500|Piotrus|Dream Focus}} I figure that you all run the gamut on how you approach articles, so we'd get a nice variety of input from all of you.

The parameter 'trustees' does not exist in the template code, however it has been documented. This leads to the questions:

1) should the parameter be added to the code, or removed from the documentation? 

2) if the parameter is be be added, should the trustees be listed under 'key people', or have a separate entry in the infobox under trustee/s?

3) Technical question - how can it be determined if any articles using the infobox have used the parameter trustess?

There was a rather poorly devised name change for this article a while ago from Dersim rebellion to Dersim massacre. This has caused some problems that were later moved to ANI, where I suggested an RFC to decide the title. None of the disputing editors took it up on it, and the AN/I thread was archived as usual. So I decided to start one myself upon the suggestion from {{u|Tiptoethrutheminefield}}.

As discussed above, I think we categorize languages in a number of ways. I propose both categories for when the language is first attested and when it is extinct. If there's issues on the titling, that can be discussed later. I also propose that the same language articles be put into the general establishments/disestablishment categories based on locations. Please either support/oppose the ''concept'' of these categories and renaming can be done later. For example, [[Meroitic language]] is in [[:Category:Languages attested from the 3rd century BC]], [[:Category:3rd-century BC establishments in Africa]], [[:Category:Languages extinct in the 4th century]]
and [[:Category:4th-century disestablishments in Africa]]. As noted above, the introductions category can be used as is done for [[Esperanto]]. I put separate discussion sections for each portion.  -- [[User:Ricky81682|Ricky81682]] ([[User talk:Ricky81682|talk]]) 03:17, 3 August 2016 (UTC)}}

Critical reception at the top is always important to make an article to stand out and most importantly, to make readers understand what the article tries to convey. Every article of music here on Wikipedia, at least good ones, tends to have a sum up at the top, talking about the writers, the song's genre, the commercial part and, of course, the critical reception. This part tends to have what the majority of the critics thought about the song, if the song received favorable/positive/negative/mixed reviews, highlighting what some critics thought about the song (if it's a highlight, if it's a filler, etc.) and some adjectives or specific details about it ("catchy", "great hook", etc.) as a simple sum up. In this article (and in some others - that's why I'm adding this template in others that have the same issue), there's an issue, since I revamped the whole article, with reliable sources, and at the top, as usual, after reading again the critical reception, I take what is more important (if the song received favorable or mixed reviews and what some critics think about the song, as what any other good user does) and add it. However, everything about the critical reception at the top was taken and I know how work and effort I put into adding these statements, and I want to contribute more and more on Wikipedia, but every article that I tend to add a critical reception at the top (which is part of good articles here and there's more than 200 examples) is taken away even if what I add (if it's positive or not and some highlights that critics claimed about the song) is the usual, as any other user add. I want to make sure that is correct adding what critics think about the song at the top, and most important, my edits to be reverted and the critical reception part to be add again at the top of the articles, because it seems like every article that I revamp and put a simple sum up about the critical reception is taken away as a big issue, but it's not at all.

Seddique Mateen is the father of the mass murderer in the June 2016 massacre
at a gay club in Orlando.  He attended a rally for the Clinton campaign and
endorsed Clinton.  He has publicly commented that while he disapproves of the
murders, he is against homosexuality (or maybe not).  These facts were
reported by media outlets as something of interest to the campaign
(presumably, something that could influence voters to vote for or against
Clinton), but public commentary on the matter died out after a few days.

Should this incident be mentioned in the article?

I request that people not comment here on details of what the article should
say about the incident, but focus on the simpler threshold issue of whether it
is even worth mentioning, as there is already controversy over even that.  If consensus

'''Should a [[WP:NPAGEANT]] set of consensus guidelines be created, linked from [[WP:N]]?'''

'''Comments by nominator:'''  Per [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Women/Article alerts]], I am seeing large numbers of beauty pageant CONTESTANT articles nominated for deletion, mostly state-level pageant winners or national winners of obscure pageants. There are also navboxes for state pageant winners for Miss USA (and maybe Miss America) as well as navboxes for each year's contestants.  Someone is going to a lot of work, while others are going to a lot work at AfD. I also see there is no [[WP:NMODEL]] set of suggested notability guidelines (SNG) that discuss pageant winners.  Most discussions cite [[WP:NMODEL]] and the general notability guidelines at [[WP:GNG]].  A few AfD discussions point out that [[WP:BIO1E]] may also be applicable. So my suggestion is to save someone a lot of time and effort and create a formal set of guidelines, linked from [[WP:N]], and to include the specific question:  Does winning a state-level pageant that is a qualifier for Miss USA or Miss America automatically or inherently confer notability? This page could also discuss what confers notability of an individual pageant as well.

{{rfcquote|text=
I'd like to propose some common sense guidelines for [[Wikipedia:Stand-alone lists#Citing sources|#Citing sources]] and/or [[MOS:MUSIC]]. There are virtually no guidelines for music genres, and because of that, I often find myself in edit wars making these same arguments over and over again, so I would like official consensus on these matters:
* WP:GENREVERIFY (clarification of [[WP:VERIFY]])
**'''Music genres are almost always [[WP:MINREF|likely to be challenged]]'''. Exceptions may be made for high-level root genres like rock, pop, electronic, folk, etc.
** Thus, '''all entries must be verifiable''' for exemplar subgenre articles like [[List of psychedelic pop artists]], [[List of blues rock musicians]], and [[List of trip hop artists]].
** "The source is in their respective articles" is not a valid rationale ([[WP:CIRCULAR]]). If it is the case, then simply copy over the relevant source(s) to establish verifiability and notability.
* WP:EXPLICITGENRE (clarification of [[WP:STICKTOSOURCE]] and [[WP:SYNTH]])
**References must be explicit in saying that the artist belongs to a genre. For instance, a source that identifies the Beatles' ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' as "a folk rock album" does not mean that the Beatles count as a folk rock band.
** Sources must ''directly support'' cited genres. When a source writes that a work "mixes experimental, rock, and jazz", it does not necessarily follow that it is a work ''of'' experimental, rock, and jazz. By the same token, if a source cites a work of pop music for using synthesizers prominently, this should not lead an editor to refer to the work as "synthpop" if not explicitly stated by the source.

I don't want a Wikia or Wikimedia alternative because I don't see anything I would be interested in editing. Uncyclopedia, RationalWiki and Encyclopedia Dramatica are too strange/weird. I'd like to find a good Wikipedia knockoff that still has strict but easily understood NPOV and verification policies that have the same rules as on Wikipedia but is interpreted the same way throughout the Wiki because it reads in an easy-to-understand way so there are no conflicts over how to properly interpret the policies and reasoning can come pretty fast but despite having similar policies to Wikipedia; won't have any way to block or ban users if they make too many stupid edits or write too much or even for harassing editors and calling them names like "disruptive" and "incompetent" too much but there are no ads so no lag or accidentally clicking one or stumbling on a bad one. I think that would be a good one because stupid people would be politely dealt with instead of being kicked from the site but still has similar copyright policy and other kinds of policy like Wikipedia, but there is no 'competence is required' policy so stupid people don't get discriminated against. #DumbLivesMatter #NoobLivesMatter #AllLivesMatter --[[User:Turkeybutt JC|Turkeybutt]] ([[User talk:Turkeybutt JC#top|talk]]) 12:58, 10 September 2016 (UTC)}}

'''In brief: How should we treat links to anthroponymy pages?'''

For those unfamiliar, [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Anthroponymy]] pages are a somewhat unique beast: they list people who share a given name or surname <s>or complete name</s>, and they are often treated like disambiguation pages, though they are categorized as set index articles. <small>(Aside: there is no MOS guideline for these pages, just the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Anthroponymy/Standards|WikiProject standards]] page. I have tried unsuccessfully to have this page promoted to the MOS; the absence of a MOS for anthro pages is a big problem to be tackled separately.)</small>

'''The issue at hand:''' There is no consensus on how to treat links to anthro pages. For ''dab'' pages, the correct method is to link to "Title (disambiguation)", which may be a redirect to the actual dab page—this is to make it clear to bots that the link is intentional, so it doesn't show up on lists of ambiguous links that need to be fixed (see [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links]]). IMO, the same logic applies to anthroponymy pages, and this has clearly been the practice for quite some time (see tens of thousands of examples in [[:Category:Redirects to disambiguation pages]]). However, this practice is in dispute (see [[User talk:Bkonrad#Alphonse]]), on the basis that anthro pages should not be considered dab pages, even for this purpose. I've tried to create a workaround with {{tl|R to anthroponymy page}}, in parallel with {{tl|R to disambiguation page}}, but I think a question affecting such a huge number of pages needs larger input. The options I see are (add any you think I missed):

For linking to anthroponymy pages:
# Point all links directly to the anthroponymy page (This leaves no simple way to sort intentional links from unintentional ones that should be further disambiguated.)
# Leave or create "Name (disambiguation)" redirects, using {{tl|R to disambiguation page}} (This has the drawback that anthro pages may not ''strictly'' be dab pages, though they do list ambiguous entries.)
# Create "Name (anthroponymy)" redirects, using {{tl|R to anthroponymy page}} (This would require the most work (probably by bot), but would, IMO, leave things in the most useful state.)

Thoughts? If you have a preference for one of the listed options, please indicate so. —[[user:swpb|<u>swpb</u>]]<sup>[[user talk:swpb|''T'']]</sup> 15:52, 24 August 2016 (UTC)}}

Should Eron Gjoni's side of the story be reported?

I tried to add Eron Gjoni's side of the story in edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gamergate_controversy&diff=734887712&oldid=734032358 734887712], but it was quickly reverted by frequents editors of this article citing "need for concensus," which seems to be abuse of the concept of concensus. Concensus is noted to be needed for bold edits. I'm adding Gjoni's side of the story in a tiny manner. There is no controversy in that. Not noting his side of the story would infringe upon [[WP:BLP]]. [[User:Mr. Magoo and McBarker|Mr. Magoo]] ([[User talk:Mr. Magoo and McBarker|talk]]) 11:22, 17 August 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I firmly believe that the lede of the "Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory" section is a case of [[WP:SYNTHESIS]]. [[User:Jobrot]] disagrees and has repeatedly reverted my [[WP:NPOV]] warning without cause. The lede currently states:
{{blockquote|'Cultural Marxism' in modern political parlance commonly refers to a conspiracy theory which sees the Frankfurt School as part of a contemporary movement within the political left to take over and destroy Western society.}}

If we pare the statement down to its essentials, it states that:

{{blockquote|'Cultural Marxism' in modern political parlance commonly refers to a conspiracy theory}}

The claim being advanced is:

1. It is a conspiracy theory.

2. This "fact" is commonly known and the cultural and political mainstream (all major political and cultural  divisions) believes this without a shadow of a doubt.

3. Only a small fringe continues to use the term in a "non-ironic" way.

The sources cited as evidence are:

1. An article by Jerome Jamin, a left-wing academic researching right-wing movements.

2. An article by Bill Berkowitz for the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], a left-wing organization which maintains large lists of what it believes to be right-wing and religious movements and hate-groups. The article is entitled '''Reframing the Enemy'''.

3. American paleo-conservative [[William S. Lind]].

Now, it is no surprise that left-wingers like Jamin and Berkowitz/SPLC believe that "Cultural Marxism" is a conspiracy theory. But Lind does not believe that. Neither do the right-wingers mentioned by Berkowitz in his article.

The conclusion is that only some left-wingers consider "Cultural Marxism" to be a conspiracy theory. And instead of stating things as they are, the section currently uses [[WP:SYNTHESIS]] and weasel words like '''commonly refers to''' (without mention the subjects who do the referring) to convert an opinion held in some parts of the left to a strong, universal claim.

I formally request comments on the structure of the lede. [[User:Last Contrarian|Last Contrarian]] ([[User talk:Last Contrarian|talk]]) 12:44, 16 August 2016 (UTC)}}

RFC Question: '''Should we add a "source code repository" field to the infobox?'''

Caveats:
* It could go against [[WP:EL]] that says links that can be found as part of official website should not be included in the article.
* Doing so can make the infobox long and unwieldy. Sometimes, like in the case of [[Signal (software)]], there are four or five links. The External Links section is a better place.
* It is technical information that is no readily usable to every reader. Only programmers willing to participate in development need ready access to such links.

Consensus was in late 2013 to merge the articles [[Miniature American Shepherd]] and [[Miniature Australian Shepherd]] (see above). This stalled due to arguing about the name in 2014, followed by johnny-come-lately objections in 2015 on the basis that some people out there are still trying to produce a separate breed or subbreed under the "Australian" name. (Note that Australia itself is not implicated in any way; all three breeds or would-be breeds under discussion actually originated in the US).

I would like to propose a discussion on the information in the article, [[List of Mock the Week episodes]], in regards to Wins and Scores.  My belief is that the information should not be included there; in my personal opinion, I don't think it has anything to warrant notability at all, as the show is not a serious competition and most of the rounds don't focus on news articles on the week before its broadcast/filming, because they involve stand-up on certain topics and improve games.  My proposal is simply to comment on what to do with the information and draw some consensus on this (after I let personal feelings get the better of me).  The following options should be considered in this discussion:

* Should the information be deleted, and if so, why should it be the case in your own words?
* Should the information be merged into the main article here, and if so, why?  If it is merged into this article, should it be all the information or some of it?
* Should the information remain where it is?  If so, why?

I have recently encountered a confusion regarding these and A7. It was insisted that Churches are eligible for A7 as organisations. However, I look through the categories, and they are definitely classed under Buildings and Structures, and I haven't yet found any indication of them being classed under organisations (unless I missed something?). Even [[Church (building)|the article about Churches]] explicitly identify them as buildings. Hotels and hospitals appear to be classed under both; what does this mean exactly? Does it mean that both [[WP:ORG]] and [[WP:GEOFEAT]] apply? If so, how does that work? And are they eligible for A7 or not, or both (???). This is all rather confusing because, if I go to (for argument's sake) [[Wexham Park Hospital]], 2 of the 3 categories there are Hospital Buildings, and Buildings and Structures. No indication of it being classed as an organisation yet. Only after digging through the categories do I find that Hospitals are also under Medical and health organisations. Same with (again, for argument's sake) [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo]]; categories include Hotel buildings, and of course, Buildings and Structures. No explicit indication of it being an organisation. Again, only after trawling through the categories do I find that hotels also come under companies. At face value, hospitals and hotels (or at least the two examples given here) appear to be classed under Buildings and Structures only. Does this mean they are ''primarily'' Buildings, and ''secondarily'' organisations? My query is thus: are these (for the purposes of A7) buildings, or organisations, and are they/should they be A7-eligible? And if they're under organisations, perhaps a note explaining all of this should be put somewhere (the templates perhaps?), or maybe a new (sub)category for A7 should be implemented?

===Statement of the issues'''

There's no "Survey" section in this RfC and no up/down vote on an action item. That can come later. There's a lot to chew on here, so let's just have a threaded discussion(s). Maybe we can generate an action item(s) to "vote" on further down the road.

It's a complicated question covering a decade of use of some half-dozen templates which are transcluded over some half a million articles, with documentation in several places. So I apologize in advance for the length of the material.

'''The basic questions of this RfC'''

The basic question is '''"How should quotes be handled in articles"''' A legitimate answer, of course, is "exactly as they have been". (We are referring in this RfC to typical quotes from a general source, not specialized situations handled by specialized templates such as {{tl|Quote hadith}} etc.)

So some more detailed questions that arise from this might be:
*Is it OK to continue to have three different templates used for general quotes, or not? Why or why not?
*The [[WP:MOS]] specifies to use {{tl|Quote}} for quotes, and doesn't mention {{tl|Quote box}} one way or the other, but {{tl|Quote box}} itself says to not use it for regular quotes -- yet {{tl|Quote box}} is used for quotes far more often than {{tl|Quote}}; ought this situation be addressed, or not, and if so how?
*{{tl|Cquote}} is used a fair amount for quotations, even though this MOS strictly forbids this; ought this situation be addressed, or not, and if so how?
*This MOS by inference supports pull quotes ("the {{tl|pull quote}}... template, which [is] reserved for pull quotes"). Should this MOS discourage or even forbid pull quotes, or is it OK like this?

And there are probably lots of other questions. Possible solutions are many, including 
*Doing nothing, leave the present situation as is.
*Functionally deleting two of {{tl|Quote}} / {{tl|Quote box}} / {{tl|Cquote}} (by just making two of them a redirect to the remaining one? or whatever would be the best way technically to achieve this function).
*Changing the documentation to overtly permit use of all three (or: some two) templates for quotes at editors' discretion.
*Designing a new template which is better than any of the existing ones and deprecating the old ones.
*Writing a new protocol which carves out separate uses for {{tl|quote}} and {{tl|quote box}} and/or {{tl|cquote}}.

And certainly there are many other good ideas to be had. That's the purpose of this RfC, to think about these and various other possibilities, and maybe we can find some that seem worthy of being presented as action items, down the road.

Hello,

I am wondering if interested editors would like to establish a WikiProject on [[homelessness]].

# Enough time has passed since [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Proposals/Homelessness|this last proposal]].
# The topic is certainly valid and notable (it's a level 4 vital article in Society), relates to a variety of fields (social work, sociology, psychology, health).
# I have recently created [[Template:Homelessness]], linking at least 70 articles on general homelessness topics, e.g. by country, type, etc. And there are others linked on separate templates and lists (e.g. [[List of homelessness organizations]], [[List of street newspapers]]).

I'm not entirely familiar with the process of creating a project, I'm guessing we would need at least 5 other editors to join the project and help index and tag pages.

Recently, an anonymous IP started annotating the list of athletes in this article with running medal counts, marked by [[File:Gold medal icon (G initial).svg|G]], [[File:Silver medal icon (S initial).svg|S]] or [[File:Bronze medal icon (B initial).svg|B]] icons. And I don't just mean one icon per person, but an icon for ''every'' medal the person ever won — [[Ian Thorpe]], for example, had nine icons after his name. As I don't believe tallying medal counts is relevant in this context, but instead just clutters up the article unnecessarily, I removed it with an explanation in my edit summary — however, my removal has now been reverted twice (once by another anonymous IP, and once by a newly registered username who's probably that same IP), with no explanation given of why the information ''was'' warranted — the only "explanation" given was a false claim that my edits constituted ''vandalism''.

Rather than letting this turn into an ongoing revert war, however, I want to solicit opinions: is there a compelling reason that I'm missing why the list of LGBT athletes in this article ''should'' directly annotate their full medal counts, or was I right to remove that as not being useful or relevant content in this context?

Extensive debate over the past week regarding the selection of a consistent citation format for citations in the [[Jane Austen]] article. A group of three editors have stepped up to offer to do the complete conversion of the article into Harvard format following WP:CITEVAR ({{ping|Jonesey95|RexxS|Prairieplant}}) which has been substantially started by them already. They were rebuffed by users Victoriaearle and Lingzhi who felt that the original version of the article from 10 years ago had initially been started in MLA format by the late Wadewitz. Since Wadewitz passed away, 5-6 editors have edited the article in different cite formats, and the late Wadewitz is no longer here to state a preference. If you SUPPORT the complete conversion of the remainder of the article in agreement with the Harvard format then indicate this as your SUPPORT, and if you OPPOSE the Harvard format then indicate your preference below.

{{rfcquote|text=
Hello, I would like to report an issue with another user on wikipedia, who has clear bias. He claims the citations being used, which involve [[John Murray (publisher)]] and the [[Calcutta journal]] (a very good journal at the time) are "unreliable", without providing any evidence to support his claim. He made similar reversions on the [[Phulkian misl]] page with the same vacuous reasoning. His edit history suggests he has a religious bias, and I am concerned that he will continually revert valid sources to favour perception of his own culture, which at the time was considered a rival to the clan who this article is concerning. I find it hard to believe this user can make such reversions without procuring any sources to support his claim. I am urging others to please investigate this matter.  

:There is a long-standing consensus that sources from the British Raj era and earlier are not reliable for history, for caste-related matters etc. There are some notes about this at [[User:Sitush/CasteSources]], among other places, and of course there is also information of a more general type at [[WP:HISTRS]]. Please do not reinstate them. And please do not ascribe motives to people without good cause, of which you have none in this instance. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 17:30, 23 September 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
 There is disagreement about whether the article should include lists of individual recent antisemitic incidents. I have argued that these are not noteworthy according to wikipedia standards because Wikipedia is not a newspaper [[WP:NOTNP]] and this seems like a list of recent and not particularly noteworthy or historically significant anti-semitic incidents. Also see [[WP:RECENT]]. I think the content in question will not pass the ten-year test. Other editors disagree with me but we seem to be consistently talking past each other, and it would be good to have some additional eyes on this. See above discussion on [[Talk:Antisemitism in 21st-century France#Don't just list incidents]] and a previous similar RfC at

In 2014 there was a very long discussion on this same talkpage, should [[:Category:People of Middle Eastern descent]] be added to this category. Obviously nobody disagrees that the Middle East is the cradle of Judaism and the Jewish people, but that is not the same. The conclusion of that discussion, in which both sides had several proponents, was that there is no consensus for the "Middle East" category. The category, that was added originally in 2012, was not removed at after that discussion, for reasons that do not matter much at this moment. The arguments against its inclusion remain the same, and are basically two-fold:
# Jews do not consider themselves to be of Middle Eastern descent.
# There have been many proselytes over the ages, making it doubtful (to a very high degree) that any person of Jewish descent is in fact of Middle Eastern descent.

The first point can benefit from some explanation. Jews who emigrated from Germany to, let's say, Israel or the United States, will call themselves German Jews. And the same for Jews from Syria, e.g., who call themselves [[Chalabi Jews]] wherever they are. But that is as far as it goes! Nobody ''knows'' in which countries their forefathers from more than a few generations ago lived, ''and nobody cares''! Certainly, if you'd ask any Jew straightforward, if they are of Middle Eastern decent, nobody would say they are because of the mere fact of being a Jew alone.

To further illustrate this point I retold a known Jewish joke in the previous discussion, about two Jews, let's say both 100% [[Ashkenazic]] Jews, where one tells the other: "Do you know you are an Iraqi Jew?" and then when the other guy vehemently denies he says "All Jews are descended from [[Abraham]] who came from [[Ur]] which is in [[Iraq]]". A similar proof [[ad absurdum]] regards mankind as a whole: most scientific and genetic research agrees that man comes from Africa, and nevertheless, not all "of .. descent" categories are part of "People of African descent", and it would be ridiculous to impose that scientific fact on descent categories, and the same is true in this case. The more so that in this case, where it is not a sure fact at all, in view of the second point regarding proselytes.

I propose to reach a conclusion that there is no place for "Middle East" categories, and per the same token "West Asian" or "Asian" categories, on any of the "Jewish descent" categories. There is at present no conformity on this issue in all of the "Jewish descent" categories, and of the many "Jewish descent" categories, some have one or more of the above. This Rfc strives to reach a conclusion that would be binding for all of them, and in my opinion that conclusion should be that those categories are out of place on all "Jewish descent" categories.

I have discovered a lot of templates that when a user prefers to be "gender-neutral", the template will use "they" instead of "it", which looks like that there are '''multiple''' people using the same account.

These templates include several from the [[Template:UAA|UAA]] series of templates, userboxes like [[Template:User not brave not admin|this]], and others.

I think that we should replace "they"s with "it"s, but want to know whether others agree.

As is the case when candidates make factually inaccurate claims, Wikipedia allows content from reliable sources to correct those claims. The Political positions of Donald Trump[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Donald_Trump] and Political positions of Hillary Clinton[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Hillary_Clinton] are full of this kind of content (just ctrl+F "PolitiFact", "Factcheck.org", "false" and so on). There is therefore no reason to remove the the content in bold which has caught attention by RS and been corrected:

* Stein accepts the scientific consensus on climate change, calling it a "national emergency".<ref name=":03" /> '''''[[FactCheck.org|Factcheck.org]]'' and the Washington Post fact-checker have however found that Stein has exaggerated the extent of projected global sea level rise due to climate change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2016/08/stein-over-the-top-on-sea-level-rise/|title=Stein Over the Top on Sea Level Rise|website=www.factcheck.org|access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/08/17/jill-stein-just-went-overboard-on-sea-level-rise/|title=Jill Stein just went way overboard on sea level rise|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref>''' She has described the [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Agreement]] as inadequate, saying it will not stop climate change.<ref name=":03" /> She has proposed to override the agreement and create a more effective one.<ref name=":03" />
* Stein has argued that the cost of transitioning to 100% renewable energy by 2030 would in part be recouped by healthcare savings, citing the experience of Cuba when it lost Soviet oil subsidies and Cubans experienced improvements in health outcomes.<ref name=":03" /> '''The Washington Post editorial board argued that "she improbably cited Cuba’s experience", noting that Cubans "became healthier because they could no longer afford to smoke or drink alcohol and because so many involuntarily lost weight."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jill-steins-fairy-tale-candidacy/2016/08/25/3bf8ba1a-6b08-11e6-99bf-f0cf3a6449a6_story.html?hpid=hp_no-name_opinion-card-b%253Ahomepage%252Fstory&utm_term=.dac83ae6f609|title=Jill Stein’s fairy-tale candidacy|last=Board|first=Editorial|date=2016-08-25|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref>'''

It is not a violation of neutrality (as Wukai claimed when he removed this content) to correct false and misleading claims that candidates make in support of their positions. Should Donald Trump's false claims about climate change be allowed to stand without correction? If not, why should Stein's? If Clinton can't be allowed to make false claims about healthcare costs, solar energy, charter schools etc., why should Stein be allowed to make misleading health claims about her energy plan?

Should the "Douglas Tottle and Others" section contain the following?
<blockquote>According to Canadian historians, "Eventually Tottle’s book lost credibility in all but the fringe Stalinist circles, but in the late 1980s material from it appeared in the American “Village Voice”<ref name="conlon">[[Jeff Coplon]], [http://www.chss.montclair.edu/English/furr/vv.html "In Search of a Soviet Holocaust"], ''[[The Village Voice]]'', January 12, 1988.</ref> and various student newspapers in Canada" [https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211152/http://www.ukrainianstudies.uottawa.ca/pdf/P_Serbyn_Danyliw07.pdf]. According to [[Cathy Young]], "the West has its own inglorious history with regard to the famine, starting with the deliberate cover-up by Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times correspondent Walter Duranty. In the late 1980s, the famine gained new visibility thanks to [[Robert Conquest]]'s [[The Harvest of Sorrow]]: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine (1987) and the TV documentary Harvest of Despair, aired in the United States and Canada. A backlash from the left was quick to follow. Revisionist Sovietologist [[J. Arch Getty]] accused Conquest of parroting the propaganda of "exiled nationalists." And in January 1988, the [[Village Voice]] ran a lengthy essay by [[Jeff Coplon]] (now a contributing editor at New York magazine) titled "In Search of a Soviet Holocaust: A 55-Year-Old Famine Feeds the Right." Coplon sneered at "the prevailing vogue of anti-Stalinism" and dismissed as absurd the idea that the famine had been created by the Communist regime. Such talk, he asserted, was meant to justify U.S. imperialism and whitewash Ukrainian collaboration with the Nazis."<ref>{{cite web|author=Cathy Young |author-link=Cathy Young |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/861rmjep.asp |title=Remember the Holodomor: The Soviet starvation of Ukraine, 75 years later |volume=14, No. 12 |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=8 December 2008 |accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> In a letter to the editors, [[Robert Conquest]] dismissed the article by Coplon as "error and absurdity".<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Conquest|author-link=Robert Conquest|publisher=Village Voice|location=New York|date=February 2, 1988|title=Letters to the editors|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/16317836/The-Ukrainian-Weekly-198808|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20151118072744/https://www.scribd.com/doc/16317836/The-Ukrainian-Weekly-1988-08|archivedate=18 November 2016}} – Reprinted by the ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'', February 21, 1988</ref></blockquote>

I am in the process of cleaning up this article in hopes of getting it to [[WP:GA]] status. One of the last main things that needs to be addressed is the list of fatalities. Now lets get one thing clear, no one is suggesting the loss of life is not tragic. The question here is does a LIST of those killed warrant placement in this article? If so, how and in what format. I took a look at [[WP:USEPROSE]] (thanks {{user|David Eppstein}} for pointing me there!) and it states ''Prose is preferred in articles as prose allows the presentation of detail and clarification of context, in a way that a simple list may not.'' Now I would like to point out the last 2 words '''''may''' not''. It is possible that a list is still the right format here. I am having a hard time seeing what would be gained by having a bunch of sequential sentences that give the name, age and location of death for each of the 15 people killed. I took a look at a couple of other articles that contain large lists of individuals killed: [[Yarnell Hill Fire]], [[Charles Whitman]] and [[Virginia Tech shooting]]. Each of these use a box on the right side of the page to list the names (not sure what the technical name for this box is... Not an infobox and not a navbox...). I am very much leaning in this direction. 

My proposal is to rewrite the [[Cedar Fire (2003)#Fatalities|fatalities section]] to have a paragraph or so about the causes of death, how the fire spread faster than predicted, how people thought they had time they didn't really have, etc. (All well referenced of course). Then to have a side box that contains a list of the killed to include Name, age and both date and location of death. Perhaps broken up by date. I welcome any and all feedback! --[[User:Zackmann08|<span style="color:DarkTurquoise;">Zackmann08</span>]] (<sup>[[User_talk:Zackmann08|Talk to me]]</sup>/<sub>[[Special:Contributions/Zackmann08|<span style="color:orange;">What I been doing</span>]]</sub>) 02:37, 6 September 2016 (UTC)}}

I think that as a matter of curating this content we need to adopt a firm and straightforward rule for inclusion: I propose that the following criterion is used:
; Each entry must be supported by one or more [[WP:RS|reliable independent sources]] establishing the significance and context of the ribbon campaign. Unsourced entries will be removed.
In fact this should be true of all content in Wikipedia but the issue here is the constant addition of poorly sourced content by well-meaning newcomers so I think we need to establish a precedent of removing unsourced or poorly sourced content. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 09:26, 8 September 2016 (UTC)}}

It is unclear how the addition of "cover versions" and "alt Artist" fields is supposed to benefit song articles.  There are now 15 new fields for "covers": 5 for "alt Artist", 5 for "Recorded by", and 5 for "Performed by".  No guidance was provided and "alt Artist" seems to duplicate the "Recorded by" or "Performed by" fields.  Besides these overlaps, "cover songs" (even the use of the term) is a problem area in song articles.  [[WP:SONGCOVER]], which provides guidelines for the addition of song renditions to articles, is routinely ignored.  Large numbers of "covers", regardless of suitability and lacking sources, are added to articles.  Providing fields for cover versions in the infobox would compound the problem.

Except regarding the merger of Infobox standard with Infobox song,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ATemplates_for_discussion%2FLog%2F2014_July_30&type=revision&diff=620184563&oldid=620184535] the addition of cover versions was not discussed.
On March 16, 2015,&nbsp;"Cover versions" and "alt Artist" were added, along with the infobox standard parameters "Recorded by" and "Performed by".[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AInfobox_song&type=revision&diff=651677830&oldid=604742131][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AInfobox_song%2Fdoc&type=revision&diff=651676326&oldid=604741950] On July 18, 2016, these were expanded to include "alt Artist2–5", "Recorded by2–5", and "Performed by2–5", with the edit note "Support up to 5 cover versions".[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_song&diff=next&oldid=730294138]  Since this is a relatively new addition, it may have seen little or no use, so removing these parameters should not be disruptive and may be cleaned up easily.

I think this section gives as it stands doesn't really clarify what Leninism is nor concerns around the theory. It reads like one side of a debate, when the observer isn't even here for it. I think that the section doesn't belong on this article and instead this should be redirected to criticism of another page or within the page. Furthermore, it doesn't really provide insights into the theory, Leninism, but rather a somewhat non-relevant historical account of what Stalin did wrong. While no doubt an important area of scholarship in its own right doesn't fit when discussing political philosophy of Lenin. It might be good under a page on Stalinism. The Philosophical successor component should be merged, but the exact mentions of a couple smaller communist parties removed and replaced with mentions around Mao Zedong Thought(Maoism) and albeit somewhat fringe: Hoxhaism. I propose delete deleting the existing paragraphs ins in this section and replacing it with the following verbage in bold:

'''In post–[[October Revolution|Revolutionary]] Russia, [[Marxism-Leninism]], which detractors at that time referred to as [[Stalinism]], and [[Trotskyism]] were the immediate principal philosophies of [[Communism]] that claimed legitimate ideological descent from Leninism. This lead to different tendencies to develop as factions within the Communist Party, each ideological faction denied the [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] of the opposing faction.<ref>''Chambers Dictionary of World History'' (2000) p. 837.</ref> In the Soviet Union, [[Marxism-Leninism]] ended up winning authority. This political philosophy was likewise adopted internationally by Communist parties who belonged to the [[Comintern]]. Trotskyism found its voice through its own international forum, called the [[Forth International]].

'''Internationally, in the decades after the death of Lenin other political philosophies claimed descendancy from Leninism, including Mao Zedong thought, otherwise known as [[Maoism]], and [[Hoxhaism]].
'''
'''In academic settings, various fields of international relation studies, such as [[Dependency theory]] and later on [[World System Theory]], have been said to be inspired by Lenin's book [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]].'''

I think this would provide a much more concise section, remove issues around undue weight, remove mentions of small political parties(it would be impossible to provide a full list of every Lenin inspired political party), and allow for a better understanding of the topic. It would also upon up the topic for future expansion from academic fields that utilize Leninist philosophy instead of a debate around the vices and virtues of trotsky and stalin.

Recently, I strove to make this article more neutral by inserting a diagram which plainly shows state subsidy, instead of dividing out the passenger kilometers which is increased to help the operators gain more money, with the effect that passengers must travel in more crowded trains. In this way, it would become apparent that state subsidy for the railway (which is what the diagram says it measures) has actually increased by a dramatic amount; this fact is hidden in the way the current diagram is "normalized". I urge bypassers to remind the coauthors who have obstructed myself of the principles of wikipedia, in particular [[WP:NPOV]], which indicates that diagrams should not be used to make a point for the privatisation by "massaging" them so that the increase in subsidy seems less severe. --[[User:Mathmensch|Mathmensch]] ([[User talk:Mathmensch|talk]]) 11:36, 11 September 2016 (UTC)}}

Is it acceptable to state a broad genre in the opening sentence of a band/musician article? For example: "''[[Metallica]] is an American heavy metal band."'' This scenario assumes that genre is reliably sourced and musical style fully explained later in the body of the article. (Like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica#Style_and_lyrical_themes this].)

In the Personal Section: propose the following be added: "In 1921 Grant moved into the [[Greenwich Village]] apartment of Australian Orry George Kelly, later to be known as the Hollywood designer [[Orry-Kelly]]: the apartment was also shared with a fellow Australian, Charles 'Spangles' Phelps, a cross-dressing performer. Kelly and Grant lived together for five years, and it has been speculated they were lovers, but Kelly lost respect for Grant: he was particularly incensed by Grant's subsequent avoidance of military duty during World War II, and their friendship ended badly."

Proposal: Change Disambiguation and Deletion policy pages to eliminate deletion of two-item disambiguation pages.

IMO, deletion of disambiguation pages based on [[wp:TWODABS]] ''NEVER'' makes sense.  If neither of two exact match items is primary, all should agree the dab is needed.  If one of two is primary, the dab page is not absolutely required, but if it is created, it should be kept.  Why?
*1. Readers seeking the primary use meaning get to it immediately, are unaffected by the dab.
*2. Avoid wasting editors' time in monitoring [[:Category:Disambiguation pages containing one non-primary topic]] to find dabs which can be eliminated, and time wasted by other editors in AFDs and other deletion processes.  
*3. <s>Disambiguation pages are glorified redirects, and [[wp:Redirects are cheap]]</s> Like the essay [[wp:redirects are cheap]] says about redirects, disambiguation pages also "take up minimal disk space and use very little bandwidth. Thus, it doesn't really hurt things if there are a few of them scattered around." (Restated per comments.)
*4. Another exact match may turn up soon, or eventually, and can be added.  
*5. A disambiguation page can hold other items useful to readers that are not exact matches, in the list of items being disambiguation or in "See also".  Readers don't necessarily know their target is not an exact match;  partial matches are helpful.
*6. Technically, we violate Wikipedia's promise to contributors that they will receive credit, each time a two-dabs page is deleted and then recreated later with two or more items.
*7. Deletions of two-dab pages are, like all other deletion actions, a negative that contributors often experience as an insult or dismissal or otherwise as a turnoff.  People need 7 or 8 positives to counter a negative experience.  Negativity drives down participation.

Why not?
*1. Readers seeking the non-primary use meaning will arrive at the primary use topic and, instead of seeing hatnote taking them directly to the non-primary use, they might be directed to the disambiguation page instead, requiring one more step.  '''But''':
**a) If the non-primary use name is long and would make the hatnote unwieldy, readers might already be directed to the disambiguation page, under current policy.
**b) '''We can simply choose not to require the hatnote to go to the disambiguation page.  Change wp:TWODABS to allow it explicity: "If there is only one non-primary use on the dab page, the hatnote can go directly to that."'''

The current process described in [[wp:Disambiguation]]'s [[wp:TWODABS]] section involves tagging TWODABS disambiguation pages with {{tl|Only-two-dabs}}, and allowing deletion if, after some non-defined length of time, other items are not added.  Let's stop the bureaucracy, reduce slightly the pipeline of articles into AFD, stop the slow churning that goes on here, and get rid of one small component of Wikipedia's negativity. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 16:22, 15 September 2016 (UTC)}}

One editor feels that the current summary is enough and that the [[Lexa (The 100)]] article should cover the rest. The other editor feels that the fact that the character's death inspired a national debate, rather than simply a small, localized uproar, and that the character became the face of the "[[bury your gays]]" trope, should be relayed. The edit also shows that two references were removed, but the two references aren't really a deal-beaker in the dispute. More on the dispute is seen above this section on the talk page.

{{rfcquote|text=
In 2014 there was a very long discussion on this same talkpage, should [[:Category:People of Middle Eastern descent]] be added to this category. Obviously nobody disagrees that the Middle East is the cradle of Judaism and the Jewish people, but that is not the same. The conclusion of that discussion, in which both sides had several proponents, was that there is no consensus for the "Middle East" category. The category, that was added originally in 2012, was not removed at after that discussion, for reasons that do not matter much at this moment. The arguments against its inclusion remain the same, and are basically two-fold:
# Jews do not consider themselves to be of Middle Eastern descent.
# There have been many proselytes over the ages, making it doubtful (to a very high degree) that any person of Jewish descent is in fact of Middle Eastern descent.

The first point can benefit from some explanation. Jews who emigrated from Germany to, let's say, Israel or the United States, will call themselves German Jews. And the same for Jews from Syria, e.g., who call themselves [[Chalabi Jews]] wherever they are. But that is as far as it goes! Nobody ''knows'' in which countries their forefathers from more than a few generations ago lived, ''and nobody cares''! Certainly, if you'd ask any Jew straightforward, if they are of Middle Eastern decent, nobody would say they are because of the mere fact of being a Jew alone.

To further illustrate this point I retold a known Jewish joke in the previous discussion, about two Jews, let's say both 100% [[Ashkenazic]] Jews, where one tells the other: "Do you know you are an Iraqi Jew?" and then when the other guy vehemently denies he says "All Jews are descended from [[Abraham]] who came from [[Ur]] which is in [[Iraq]]". A similar proof [[ad absurdum]] regards mankind as a whole: most scientific and genetic research agrees that man comes from Africa, and nevertheless, not all "of .. descent" categories are part of "People of African descent", and it would be ridiculous to impose that scientific fact on descent categories, and the same is true in this case. The more so that in this case, where it is not a sure fact at all, in view of the second point regarding proselytes.

I propose to reach a conclusion that there is no place for "Middle East" categories, and per the same token "West Asian" or "Asian" categories, on any of the "Jewish descent" categories. There is at present no conformity on this issue in all of the "Jewish descent" categories, and of the many "Jewish descent" categories, some have one or more of the above. This Rfc strives to reach a conclusion that would be binding for all of them, and in my opinion that conclusion should be that those categories are out of place on all "Jewish descent" categories.

can the editors use the qualifier "major role" to define the role, or is it [[WP:OR|original research]] to add the phrase without supporting citation? - [[User:Jack Sebastian|Jack Sebastian]] ([[User talk:Jack Sebastian|talk]])

'''Alternative phrasings'''

*'''Leave as is''', the editors should be allowed to evaluate the quality of the role without exact sourcing as to phrasing.
*'''Alternative #1''', "During the mid-1990s, Portman had roles in the films A, B and C and Beautiful Girls, '''garnering significant acclaim with the latte'''r.".
*'''Alternative #2''', "During the mid-1990s, Portman had roles in the films A, B and C. '''Her breakout role came in the 1996 film Beautiful Girls, where she garnered significant acclaim'''."
*'''Alternative #3''',''"'"During the mid-1990s, Portman had roles in the films A, B and C. '''Her performance in the small ensemble film Beautiful Girls garnered significant acclaim."''

'''Note'''

The question of phrasing had been the subject of two earlier RfCs, linked [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Natalie_Portman#RfC:_Is_the_language_biased.3F here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Natalie_Portman#Does_a_.22major.22_role_need_to_be_cited_as_such_by_reliable_sources.3F here]. The first RfC's closing Admin took note of  the poor phrasing of the RfC and that use of the term "major role" was not biased. It was suggested that another, better crafted RfC be submitted to address the matter.<br>
The closing admin on the second RfC noted that, as one word had generated so much debate, it would have been wise to ''"rephrase the sentence altogether, and present the available information in another way."''<sup><small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Natalie_Portman&diff=732520000&oldid=731637535 1]</small></sup>

'''Note'''

There have been three previous discussions on this issue in the last six months, all started by the same editor. Two were RfCs linked above, and an earlier discussions at [[Talk:Natalie Portman/Archive 3#Major roles]]. Also see the discussion immediately above this current RfC at [[Talk:Natalie Portman#Revisiting "a major role" wording]]. The first RfC was closed with the statement "there is a very strong consensus that 'a major role' is not biased." The second RfC was closed with the comment "The rough consensus is that 'major role' is an evaluative qualifier that requires verification, but there is '''no consensus to require exact wording in sources''' as it is often described in different terms in cited sources across BLPs of actors." In all four discussions an important point argued for keeping the current consensus of "major role" is that other means of determining major role, such as Portman's top billing in the film, can be used.
:Er, you do see the notes section immediately above this that says the same thing, right? Your're supposed to present a neutral Notes section, without rendering your opinion.

How should the lead section describe the comments that lead to Watson's resignation from CSHL in 2007?

'''Background'''

The current stable version of the lead of [[James Watson]] describes certain controversial comments that led to Watson's resignation in 2007 thusly:

Over the past months several editors (most recently myself) have attempted to change this wording to one which they argue more accurately represents third party coverage of Watson's comments (diffs: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=721267252&oldid=721260231][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=721450244&oldid=721267252][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=730525194&oldid=730448318][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=730630795&oldid=730525722][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=733157247&oldid=730795729][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=733159191&oldid=733157247][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=739607607&oldid=739097329][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=739629197&oldid=739607607][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=740177315&oldid=739717994][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Watson&diff=740193455&oldid=740177315]). Suggestions have included:
* ...after making controversial comments claiming a link between [[race and intelligence]].
* ...after making controversial comments about the intelligence of Africans and people of African descent.
* Watson resigned this position and was widely shunned after making comments implying black people are less intelligent than others.

These changes have been reverted by others who argue that they are not supported by the sources; or that they imply Watson is racist, and that this violates [[WP:NPOV]], [[WP:BLP]] and/or [[WP:ARBR&I]]. Lengthy discussions on this talk page have failed to resolve the dispute, and we think a wider discussion amongst uninvolved editors is sorely needed.

Hi all. I first founded DRN back in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution_noticeboard&diff=432344305&oldid=432344111 June 2011], and I think it's had a good run over that time. But I wonder if it's still effective. Back then, success rate on DRN was quite high and we had a good amount of volunteers. Nowadays, it seems we only have a handful, with one user doing most of the work {hats off to [[User:Robert McClenon|Robert]] for holding down the fort). That said, success seems quite low. DRN closes disputes for three reasons, successful (resolved successfully), failed (clearly unresolved) and general close (neither successful or unsuccessful, often procedural close due to inactivity/unsuitable request/incorrect forum).

I've done some digging, and here's the stats for this year: 208 cases filed, 8% (16) failed, 6 (3%) were successfully resolved, and the other 186 (89%) were closed for other reasons.

I'm hoping to get input from members of the community here. DRN was once a useful process with many volunteers, but I worry that it might have become too process-oriented and strict, and wonder how much value it's adding. What can we do to improve the process, or if nothing else, what dispute resolution alternatives do we have? <span style="font-family:Verdana;">[[User:Steven Crossin|<span style="color:#078330;">Steven</span>]] [[User talk:Steven Crossin|<span style="color:#2875B0;">Crossin</span>]]</span> 05:38, 31 October 2016 (UTC)}}

Sadly, most of these broad investments are as compromised as the American economy—degraded as it is by the fossil fuel, defense and finance industries." Asked why she did not invest in socially responsible index funds or clean energy funds, Stein said that she had "not yet found the mutual funds that represent my goals of advancing the cause of people, planet and peace".[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/26/jill-stein-s-ideology-says-one-thing-her-investment-portfolio-says-another.html} [[User:Snooganssnoogans|Snooganssnoogans]] ([[User talk:Snooganssnoogans|talk]]) 12:23, 31 October 2016 (UTC)}}

Should England be referred to as an '''erroneous''' metonym for the United Kingdom? (bolded word is the proposal)

We have been unable to reach a consensus on this issue.  I have attempted to add information to the effect that using the word "England" to refer to "the United Kingdom" is incorrect, hence the use of the word erroneous.  This is based on the definition of England as a country which borders Scotland and Wales and which is a constituent, along with those two countries, Northern Ireland and numerous overseas territories, of the United Kingdom.  Referring to a part of a country as the whole is incorrect, much like referring to New York and the whole of the USA.  This may be a colloquialism used in some parts of the world, but minor usage does not imply correctness.

I believe that either this definition should be removed completely, or it should be highlighted here that the usage is incorrect, as including it here seems to be attempted approval of the misuse, which I understand is against the purpose of this website.[[User:Triune|Triune]] ([[User talk:Triune|talk]]) 20:43, 3 October 2016 (UTC)}}

Let's move to [[WP:NOTVOTE|collecting !votes]] so we can actually determine what the consensus is on inclusion of Rocky De La Fuente and Laurence Kotlikoff in the infobox.  Keep in mind the previous consensus that the fundamental infobox inclusion criterion is that it is legally possible for the candidate to win a majority of the votes in the Electoral College, and that write-in access counts in principle (see [[#A call for consensus on McMullin and Castle]] above).  This consensus is not being revisited here.  The question here is what kind of write-in ballot access counts.  The main considerations are:
* Should we continue to require actual documentation that electors have been selected, as was done in 2012? (See [[Talk:United States presidential election, 2016/Archive 12#Auditing the write-in access|#Auditing the write-in access]] above.)
* Should we count the 54 electoral votes from the six "free write-in" states (AL, NH, NJ, PA, RI, VT), which do not have a process for advance filing as a write-in candidate?
* Should there be additional requirements for candidates who need write-in access to get to 270 electoral votes, such as requiring that they have on-ballot access for a certain number of states or electoral votes?

The wording on this template is a bit awkward and not adapted. The current text is:

<blockquote>This article contains one or more [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Lists#Incomplete lists|incomplete lists]] which may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by [{{fullurl:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|action=edit}} expanding it{{\}}them] with entries that are [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliably sourced]].</blockquote>

I propose a new parameter and usage for articles that have multiple lists:

* <code><nowiki>{{Dynamic a-list|plural}}</nowiki></code>
* <code><nowiki>{{Dynamic a-list|plural=yes}}</nowiki></code> (alternative syntax)

This template could use a parameter <code>plural</code> to display the following message for multiple lists in article:

<blockquote>This article contains multiple [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Lists#Incomplete lists|incomplete lists]] which may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by [{{fullurl:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|action=edit}} expanding them] with entries that are [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliably sourced]].</blockquote>

In addition, the parameter syntax <code>plural=no</code> could be used to create the following message:

<blockquote>This article contains an [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Lists#Incomplete lists|incomplete list]] which may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by [{{fullurl:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|action=edit}} expanding it] with entries that are [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliably sourced]].</blockquote>

The text without the plural parameter can be left as-is, mainly also for compatibility reasons and ease of use/ambiguity. <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> statements can be considered to be supported as well.

Additionally, can Wikipedia suggest me a reasonable way to ask our editors  - a question continuously deleted from the Ref desk by two editors - who ''mistakenly'' think my question is not genuine?

Today, I asked a question at the reference desk <small>(for details about the question, see the last section below, in small letters)</small>.
Unfortunately, two editors who - ''instead of assuming a good faith'' - thought my question was not genuine, deleted it from the Ref desk, while adding a comment - on the summary edit - that there was no way to answer my question. However, I think that - instead of their deleting a (legitimate) question from the ref desk - they should have written their (unnecessarily correct) comment ''on the ref desk'', and should have let other editors try to answer my (legitimate) question.

<small>Actually, what happened was the following: Today I noticed, that some people had used the connection between the word Trump and the word trumpet, e.g. [http://spectator.org/let-trump-be-trumpet/ in this paper], so I wanted to know whether anybody before me has also noticed the connection between Trump's name and Trump's rival's husband's expertise in playing trumpet. I innocently asked about that - at the reference desk, but unfortunately my question was deleted (instead of assuming a good faith).</small>

'''Proposals'''

'''A: PC1 protection for all articles'''

'''Implement Level 1 Pending Changes protection for all articles.''' The protection itself would be performed by a bot created for this purpose. 

This solution would keep the general public from seeing vandalism or statements that are unsourced/poorly-written, perhaps saving Wikipedia the periodic public embarrassment it has to deal with whenever hoaxes and vandalism are viewed by readers (consider the [http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/hillary-clinton-wikipedia-hacked/ widespread media attention] that Wikipedia recently received after [[Hillary Clinton]]'s article was replaced with an obscene image).  

''It is important to recognize that PC1 protection would not keep anyone from actually editing any page. It would simply require that a reviewer approve article edits by an anonymous or non-autoconfirmed user.''

'''Support A'''

#'''Strong Support'''. Long overdue. Globally, Wikipedia is the seventh most popular website. Millions upon millions of people rely on it every day for basic information. But yet we continue with a policy of letting any random person add anything they want on almost any article (even our most highly-viewed or highly-prized ones) without even reviewing most of those edits or requiring sources for them. We have no way of knowing how many inaccurate statements may exist on Wikipedia already, due to our ''laissez-faire'' quality requirements, and spreading potentially inaccurate or biased information to millions of people is no laughing matter, especially in subjects such as medicine. Such misinformation can have dangerous real-life effects, and it is our moral responsibility to take action to prevent such things.<p>Wikipedia has been publicly embarrassed many times, such as when [http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/hillary-clinton-wikipedia-hacked/ a highly-visible article is grossly vandalized], or when hoaxes or inaccurate information are discovered to have existed for a long time on some articles. Wikipedia itself has a [[Reliability_of_Wikipedia#Notable_incidents|list of such incidents]]. It is long past time that this endless cycle stop. Why do we keep letting this happen? There's an old saying which says that "insanity is doing is the same thing over and over again and expecting different results." No one person is to blame for this, but what is to blame is the general anti-change environment.<p>So these problems are very much fixable, if we simply become willing to try new things and wake up to the need for common-sense changes. And this proposal is one of the simplest, low-impact, most common-sense way to start. '''An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'''

This '''Pending Changes expansion RfC''' consists of several proposals regarding [[WP:PC|pending changes protection]]. 

The first two proposals concern the expansion of [[WP:PC1|Level 1 PC protection]] to either all articles or only ones of the highest quality and/or importance. PC1 protection requires that a reviewer approve any revision by an anonymous or non-autoconfirmed user before it becomes visible to the general public. The aim of these proposals is to ensure that the general public does not see vandalism, inaccurate/unsourced statements, or poorly-written content. In this way, Wikipedia's quality could hopefully be stabilized somewhat, allowing editors to eliminate backlogs without worrying about the backlog increasing yet again.

The third proposal would help PC reviewers deal with the increased backlog by means of more efficient reviewing systems.

As with all other RfCs, this RfC will run for thirty days.

However, this information has been deleted from her page.

The site http://www.wiseshe.com/2013/05/10-most-beautiful-indian-women.html ranks Mumtaz as one of the 10 most beautiful Indian women. 
When Mumtaz was active in Hindi Cinema, Internet was unheard of. So, whatever critical information about her professional life is available, is actually in print media. Transcripts of some of the articles are available at www.angelfire.com/celeb/mumtaz/articles.html. Other sources are the sites which have been created with memories of various persons following her life; her interviews; or information from her family members, etc. However the information exchanged in communications would hardly be available in print. It's not only impossible but also unethical to record the conversations. Hence, there would a large amount of information which cannot be cross-referenced tangibly. Anyway, let's have look at a single article where every word, every phrase, every sentence, and every para is cross-referenced!

The statement that "Jeetendra and Mumtaz acted in a number of films together, including unsuccessful films such as ''Boond Jo Ban Gai Moti'' (1967), ''Himmat'', ''Kathputli'', and ''Roop Tera Mastana'', as well as successful one such as ''Jigri Dost'' (1969), ''Humjoli'' (where Mumtaz had a cameo role) and ''Ek Naari Ek Brahmchari'' (1971). Mumtaz also acted opposite Feroz Khan in ''Aag'' (1967), ''Aadmi Aur Insaan'', ''Upaasna'', ''Mela'', ''Apradh'', and ''Nagin''; and with Sanjay Khan in ''Upasana'', ''Dhadkan'', ''Mela''" does not seen contentious at all.

What's wrong in including the site "www.mumtaz.in" or "www.angelfire.com/celeb/mumtaz" which quotes a number of print media which are the national film magazines of India? [[User:Juhi47|Juhi47]] ([[User talk:Juhi47|talk]]) 09:52, 7 November 2016 (UTC)}}

[[File:Pierre Bourdieu.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Bourdieu Strasbourg crop.jpg|thumb]]
The discussion at hand concerns whether this image of Bourdieu should be in the infobox: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Pierre_Bourdieu.jpg

Or this one: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Bourdieu_Strasbourg_crop.jpg

Why do I believe the former image is better than the latter? As I noted in my latest revision summary: it is aesthetically and functionally better, for it is not a grainy, cropped image taken from a random meeting with other people. It is professional and shows him speaking. It is moreover also the image used on all the other major language versions of the article (French, Spanish, Italian, etc.). Finally it shows him as he was best known to the public appearance-wise; the other image is of him when he was already quite old and shows him in a way that does not fit the public impression of him as established throughout his career (just do a google image search for him).

There are also downsides for that picture, however. It is somewhat blurry, and I hope someone with the requisite Photoshop skills can produce a better version of it as that is one of the main arguments I've seen from those who prefer the other image.

If better arguments are presented for why the other image is better, I am all ears and am open to changing my mind, as I hope others are as well, in particular when a better version of the first image is presented.

There is an increase of the need of a '''Notability criteria for volleyball players''' since there are a lot of recent creation of BLP and clubs with dubious relevance. I would like to introduce this proposal:
;Volleyball players and head coachs are deemed notable if they meet any of the criteria below:
# Has competed in the [[Olympics]], [[FIVB World Cup|World Cup]], [[FIVB Club World Championship|Club World Championship]] or senior [[FIVB Volleyball World Championship|World Championships]].
# Has won a medal at one of the following competitions: [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Champions Cup|World Grand Champions Cup]], [[FIVB Volleyball World League|World League]], [[FIVB World Grand Prix|World Grand Prix]], [[Goodwill Games]], [[Pan American Games]], [[Commonwealth Games]], [[Asian Games]], and any Senior Continental Championship.
# Has won a gold medal at the senior level at any other major elite international event (e.g. the [[All-Africa Games]], [[South American Games]]).
# Has been inducted into <s>a major hall of fame, such as</s> the [[Volleyball Hall of Fame]].
Note: College and youth players <s>are not notable unless they satisfy one of the statements above, or if they can be shown to meet the wider</s> will follow [[WP:NCOLLATH]] or the requirements of [[WP:GNG]].

I know that professional leagues and league players are being left for this proposal and an item about it should be added. Something like:
#Players who have played, and managers who have managed in a fully professional league, will generally be regarded as notable. See a [[WP:FPL|list of fully professional leagues kept by WikiProject Football]].
Another item that should be covered is beach volleyball. It should be something like:
;Beach volleyball players are deemed notable if they meet any of the criteria below:
# Has competed in the [[Beach volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], [[FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships|World Championship]] and the [[FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour|World Tour]].
# Has won a medal at one of the following competitions: [[Pan American Games]], [[Commonwealth Games]], [[Asian Games]], and any Senior Continental Championship
# Has been inducted into <s>a major hall of fame, such as</s> the [[Volleyball Hall of Fame]].
Please let finish the discussion with a solid criteria. I hope this is not left unattended. --[[User talk:Osplace|Osplace]] 15:42, 19 October 2016 (UTC)}}

Should the naming convention for this tree be "Culture '''of''' City" or "Culture '''in''' City"? My understanding was always that consensus had been established as "of", but after reviewing this category and the various country-specific subcategories in {{cl|Culture by nationality and city}}, I'm finding a much closer split than I expected — there are 305 ''ofs'', 238 ''ins'', and a handful of outliers that will have to be renamed either way because they're using non-standard formats like "City culture". (There was also one case, and I'm surprised not more, where "Culture of city" and "Culture in city" ''both'' existed for the same city — given the circumstances, I've temporarily merged them both into the form that was otherwise the "norm" in its ''own'' country, although obviously it can be renamed the other way if consensus settles on the other form.)

;Summary of issue
There has been debates, reverts, and contentious editing regarding the lead of this BLP (see the above talk page sections: [[#Accusations of sexual misconduct in lead section]], [[#Removal of sexual misconduct allegations]], [[#RFC:Recent allegations in lede]], [[#Potential paragraph at end of lede on sex abuse allegations]], [[#Concern about the lede]], [[#Sentence on sexual misconduct in lede paragraph on campaign]], and [[#Access Hollywood tape in lead section]]). 

There are multiple objections and issues raised, but they all center around the inclusion or exclusion of allegations of sexual misconduct, harassment, assault, and crimes by Trump against a number of women. The relevant information in the body of the article can primarily be found at [[Donald Trump#Presidential campaign, 2016|§ Presidential campaign, 2016]], which summaries the fuller article [[Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations]]. 

So far, the issues raise have been about (1) the existence of any mention in the [[WP:LEAD|lede]] and (2) the length of any such mention. Regarding (2), among those who think it should be included, some have suggested only one or two sentences be added while other suggest a stand-alone paragraph is warranted. Specific policies and guidelines raised in previous discussions include [[WP:DUE|due weight]], [[WP:RECENTISM|recentism]], [[WP:LEAD|lede guidelines]], potential [[WP:BLP|biography of living persons]] violations, and adherence to a [[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]].

Examples of past lede edits: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_Trump&diff=744499671&oldid=744494313 paragraphs], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_Trump&diff=744864859&oldid=744863901 paragraph], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_Trump&diff=744763397&oldid=744758492 sentence].

;Need for this RfC
Current discussions are disjointed, redundant, and contentious. Some attempts at consensus-building and !voting have been relative unfruitful. It is unclear if there is [[WP:CONSENSUS|consensus]] for anything. Unlike straw polls and other !votes, an RfC can help bring in new editors to voice their opinions and (hopefully) generate a stronger consensus. Per a request in the above section, I am making a good-faith attempt at creating a neutrally-worded RfC to assess consensus on the aforementioned issues. If you feel I have not adequately or correctly summarized the debate, please feel free to suggest clarification or changes to the background infomation. Because of the complicated nature of the issues and past discussion, please forgive my multi-question RfC. It is the only way I can see any RfC addressing the core issues and making any headway.

;Questions
#Should the lede of this BLP include any summary of the allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump?
#If the material is included, to what extent should it be covered in the lead?

This discussion is about the formatting of the awards table on the page. 

*'''Option A''' is to maintain the current single table. The reasoning given is that the table is sortable, allowing a user to sort through all of the awards, by year, type, recipient and outcome, allowing easier searching of particular items, for instance all awards won by Peter Dinklage.
*'''Option B''' is to use multiple tables as found in many other list articles, separating the awards by type, i.e. a table for Emmy's, a table for Golden Globes, etc, with the table focusing on that particular brand of awards.

I've had enough of my pictures reverted by Nightscream to know how the discussion will go with him alone, so I am creating this RFC. I placed an updated picture of Jaffee taken at his birthday celebration last year. This stayed up for a while but was then reverted to an earlier picture, which I think was inferior. I don't feel I need to explain why, as it would (I thought) be obvious. The photo was removed with a comment about the shadow - it looks fine on the monitors I've checked, but if someone wants to adjust the contrast, I wouldn't object obviously.

The dispute can be found at [[Talk:Barack Obama religion conspiracy theories#Judgement of theological claims]]. The language of the lede section describes the subsequent information of the article body as "false." However, the article contains two distinct types of information: claims that are verifiable (i.e. those pertaining to Obama's religious beliefs) and those that are theological and unverifiable (i.e. what Obama represents to various religions or persons, e.g. "the antichrist). The dispute is whether both of those can be called false while complying with [[WP:NPOV]] or just the former.

{{rfcquote|text=
'''Proposal: Change Disambiguation and Deletion policy pages to eliminate deletion of two-item disambiguation pages.'''

IMO, deletion of disambiguation pages based on [[wp:TWODABS]] ''NEVER'' makes sense.  If neither of two exact match items is primary, all should agree the dab is needed.  If one of two is primary, the dab page is not absolutely required, but if it is created, it should be kept.  Why?
*1. Readers seeking the primary use meaning get to it immediately, are unaffected by the dab.
*2. Avoid wasting editors' time in monitoring [[:Category:Disambiguation pages containing one non-primary topic]] to find dabs which can be eliminated, and time wasted by other editors in AFDs and other deletion processes.  
*3. <s>Disambiguation pages are glorified redirects, and [[wp:Redirects are cheap]]</s> Like the essay [[wp:redirects are cheap]] says about redirects, disambiguation pages also "take up minimal disk space and use very little bandwidth. Thus, it doesn't really hurt things if there are a few of them scattered around." (Restated per comments.)
*4. Another exact match may turn up soon, or eventually, and can be added.  
*5. A disambiguation page can hold other items useful to readers that are not exact matches, in the list of items being disambiguation or in "See also".  Readers don't necessarily know their target is not an exact match;  partial matches are helpful.
*6. Technically, we violate Wikipedia's promise to contributors that they will receive credit, each time a two-dabs page is deleted and then recreated later with two or more items.
*7. Deletions of two-dab pages are, like all other deletion actions, a negative that contributors often experience as an insult or dismissal or otherwise as a turnoff.  People need 7 or 8 positives to counter a negative experience.  Negativity drives down participation.

Why not?
*1. Readers seeking the non-primary use meaning will arrive at the primary use topic and, instead of seeing hatnote taking them directly to the non-primary use, they might be directed to the disambiguation page instead, requiring one more step.  '''But''':
**a) If the non-primary use name is long and would make the hatnote unwieldy, readers might already be directed to the disambiguation page, under current policy.
**b) '''We can simply choose not to require the hatnote to go to the disambiguation page.  Change wp:TWODABS to allow it explicity: "If there is only one non-primary use on the dab page, the hatnote can go directly to that."'''

The current process described in [[wp:Disambiguation]]'s [[wp:TWODABS]] section involves tagging TWODABS disambiguation pages with {{tl|Only-two-dabs}}, and allowing deletion if, after some non-defined length of time, other items are not added.  Let's stop the bureaucracy, reduce slightly the pipeline of articles into AFD, stop the slow churning that goes on here, and get rid of one small component of Wikipedia's negativity.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should the lead of the article on [[Johannes Brahms]] include the statement "He was a master of counterpoint, the complex and highly disciplined art for which Johann Sebastian Bach is famous"? 

This sentence was included by [[User:Marlindale|Marlindale]] in the paragraph describing Brahms's compositional style. [[User:Tony1|Tony]] deleted the sentence, contending that this is "a highly dubious claim in the text that counterpoint was central to Brahms's style" and that "To mount a case in a 'balanced' summary article that counterpoint was central to Brahms's style is, I believe, inappropriate."

I disputed this contention, noting that virtually all the musicologists who have written about Brahms's work have noted his extensive use of counterpoint as an essential element in his style. [[User:Ravpapa|Ravpapa]] ([[User talk:Ravpapa|talk]]) 07:37, 20 October 2016 (UTC)}}

The [[Wikipedia:Non-admin closure]] is an oft-quoted essay amongst editors frequenting deletion discussions. The discussions about upgrading this to an essay perhaps first took place in the [[Wikipedia talk:Non-admin closure#essay vs guideline|year 2008]] and ended with no consensus to upgrade the same; one reason was the instruction creep within the current essay. Another reason was that the essay, at least in the opinion of some, had a few statements that went against current policy.

*Should the [[Wikipedia:Non-admin closure]] essay be upgraded to guideline status, with the community working on the essay thereon to reduce the instruction creep and modifying any statements imminently conflicting with current deletion policy?

However, this information has been deleted from her page.

The site http://www.wiseshe.com/2013/05/10-most-beautiful-indian-women.html ranks Mumtaz as one of the 10 most beautiful Indian women. 
When Mumtaz was active in Hindi Cinema, Internet was unheard of. So, whatever critical information about her professional life is available, is actually in print media. Transcripts of some of the articles are available at www.angelfire.com/celeb/mumtaz/articles.html. Other sources are the sites which have been created with memories of various persons following her life; her interviews; or information from her family members, etc. However the information exchanged in communications would hardly be available in print. It's not only impossible but also unethical to record the conversations. Hence, there would a large amount of information which cannot be cross-referenced tangibly. Anyway, let's have look at a single article where every word, every phrase, every sentence, and every para is cross-referenced!

The statement that "Jeetendra and Mumtaz acted in a number of films together, including unsuccessful films such as ''Boond Jo Ban Gai Moti'' (1967), ''Himmat'', ''Kathputli'', and ''Roop Tera Mastana'', as well as successful one such as ''Jigri Dost'' (1969), ''Humjoli'' (where Mumtaz had a cameo role) and ''Ek Naari Ek Brahmchari'' (1971). Mumtaz also acted opposite Feroz Khan in ''Aag'' (1967), ''Aadmi Aur Insaan'', ''Upaasna'', ''Mela'', ''Apradh'', and ''Nagin''; and with Sanjay Khan in ''Upasana'', ''Dhadkan'', ''Mela''" does not seen contentious at all.

What's wrong in including the site "www.mumtaz.in" or "www.angelfire.com/celeb/mumtaz" which quotes a number of print media which are the national film magazines of India? [[User:Juhi47|Juhi47]] ([[User talk:Juhi47|talk]]) 09:52, 7 November 2016 (UTC)}}

An editor has argued that films are being placed in the [[hebephilia]] category when they are not about hebephilia and/or the characters are not hebephiles (which are people with a sexual preference for young pubescents, and not merely the case of people committing [[statutory rape]]) and that the additions are therefore [[WP:Original research]] violations. Another another editor has argued that some of the films should be included, that the additions aid navigation and that it's better that these films are placed in the hebephilia category instead of being wrongly placed [[:Category:Films about pedophilia]]. The editor is, however, unsure about whether some films should be placed in the category. If we look at the [[L.I.E.]] article, for example, we see that it was categorized as a film about hebephilia, while the lead [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=L.I.E.&diff=746680388&oldid=740102106 once categorized] the character in question as an [[ephebophile]] and the reception section calls him a [[pedophile]]. So should we allow editors to categorize these films based on their own judgment? Or should the films be removed if there are no reliable sources identifying the films as being about hebephilia? Should films only be included if they fit the hebephilia definition (which is the sexual preference for young pubescents, rather than an act of statutory rape)?

There's a slow-motion edit war going on between me (sorry) and an unregistered user who keeps hopping IPs, making communication difficult. For that reason, here's a thread for discussing the issue behind the revert cycle.

*In September 2016, Euronews apparently ceased to be listed on the [[Freesat]] EPG. Nobody has been able to find a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] for this, but there we go.
*The IP user wishes to add the words "after the Brexit vote" (or similar) to the sentence in question. Yeah, it did happen after the Brexit vote, but so did a lot of things.
*I believe that adding the words "after the Brexit vote" implicitly links the two events.
*Nobody, myself included, has been able to find a reliable source that links these two events. Debates on various forums do not count according to Wikipedia rules.
*The IP user asserts that it is the responsibility of the person removing the unreferenced text to find a source that agrees with them. Of course, proving a negative is impossible and that way lies madness.
*The slow motion edit war is staying just under the [[WP:3RR|3RR]] for now, but eventually one of us will cross that bright red line; the IP has the advantage as they will just shift IPs if blocked. I can't.

If PL/I is unsupported, what needs to be done to support it? I would think that, since the article apperance is the same, the source tag would be preferable siince the markup could always be updated later.

Hello Wiki community, this is Jack, I work for Edelman in London, UK.

To begin with, I just want to disclose that Lord Myners is our chairman, so there is a COI here. However, after reading this Wiki entry and seeing this is listed as 'Start Class', I feel that the page can be enhanced with additional factual and encyclopaedic detail. 

It also has some now out of date information. I hope we can work together to present a more complete edition of this entry. As an employee of Edelman, I have not and will not edit the article. Particularly as I do not want to cause any reason to question the neutrality of this article. However, as a person with links to Paul Myners, I would like to provide additional detail. I’ve compiled a few thoughts for potential additions to this posting, including links to 3rd party sources to help maintain factual accuracy.



I think it is relevant to add to the lead section that as well as being made a life peer in consequence of his appointment, he also was made a Member of the Upper House of Parliament. It seems unnecessary to say he’s non elected as it’s implied from ‘by consequence of his appointment’ so this is repetition. He joined the Lords on 16th October 2008 and now sits as a crossbencher – another fact that seems quite worthy of inclusion.
[Parliament website referencing Paul’s current status in the Lords:  [http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/lord-myners/3869]

Just moving on to his background and personal life, it states his political views are not known. While I won’t dispute this – I do have source material saying he views himself as a ‘progressive liberal’. This would seem worthy of inclusion.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v-yvOPKp3RkC&pg=PT99&lpg=PT99&dq=paul+myners+liberal+progressive&source=bl&ots=FB4b1lSG_Y&sig=EoEfDjRs83JyeymKPpNn2t8t6Ko&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDn6uA8YTQAhUi2oMKHU2-ADsQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&q=paul%20myners%20liberal%20progressive&f=false]

It’s also prudent to point out that Alison Macleod is now a former chair of the Institute of Contemporary Art; and that Paul Myners has residences in London and near Falmouth, as well as five children.

Initial Telegraph article announces Alison Macleod’s appointment, while the second confirms that Donald Moore is the current Chair

{{rfcquote|text=
It has been suggested (above, at [[#Philip "Phil" Chess]]) that the example and wording [[WP:QUOTENAME]] regarding the presentation of nicknames and [[hypocorism]]s (diminutives) is not entirely clear, thus leaving open whether an article such as (for instance) [[Tom Petty]] Should begin {{xt|'''Thomas Earl '''"'''Tom'''"''' Petty''' is...}} or just {{xt|'''Thomas Earl Petty''' is...}} (with the "Tom" being implied by the article title and the fact that it's an obvious and very common shortening of "Thomas").  

To avoid endless confusion and discussion and contention, let's clarify what is intended here and nail this down one way or another. (I used <u>underlines</u> to show both additions and changes.)

The '''current wording''' of the operative paragraph in [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section#Usage in first sentence]] is:</br>
:{{xt|The name of a person is presented in full if known, including any given names that are not included in the article's title or are abbreviated there. For example, the article on [[Calvin Coolidge]] gives his name as '''John Calvin Coolidge, Jr.''' If a person has a commonly known nickname, used in lieu of a given name, it is presented between quote marks following the last given name or initial, as for [[John F. Kennedy]], which has '''John Fitzgerald''' "'''Jack'''" '''Kennedy'''. The quotation marks are not put in bold. A nickname that comes in place of the whole name should be presented after the full name, in parentheses. Also acceptable are formulations like "'''Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi''', better known as '''Sandro Botticelli'''", when applicable.}}
</br></br>
'''Proposal 1''' is to clarify that both common [[hypocorism]]s (diminutives) ''and'' nicknames are to be included (in quote marks) in the initial presentation of the name:</br>
:{{xt|The name of a person is presented in full if known, including any given names that are not included in the article's title or are abbreviated there. For example, the article on [[Calvin Coolidge]] gives his name as '''John Calvin Coolidge, Jr.''' If a person <u>is</u> commonly known <u>by a</u> [[nickname]] <u>or [[hypocorism]]</u>, used in lieu of a given name, it is presented between quote marks following the last given name or initial, as for <u>[[Tom Petty]]</u>, which has <u>'''Thomas Earl '''"'''Tom'''"''' Petty'''</u>. The quotation marks are not put in bold. A nickname that comes in place of the whole name should be presented after the full name, in parentheses. Also acceptable are formulations like "'''Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi''', better known as '''Sandro Botticelli'''", when applicable.}}
</br></br>
'''Proposal 2''' is to differentiate between common hypocorisms and other nicknames, and to proscribe writing the hypocorism (diminutive) when it is common and obvious:</br>
:{{xt|The name of a person is presented in full if known, including any given names that are not included in the article's title or are abbreviated there. For example, the article on [[Calvin Coolidge]] gives his name as '''John Calvin Coolidge, Jr.''' If a person <u>is</u> commonly known <u>by a</u> [[nickname]] <u>that is not a common [[hypocorism]]</u>, used in lieu of a given name, it is presented between quote marks following the last given name or initial, as for <u>[[Bunny Berigan]]</u>, which has <u>'''Roland Bernard '''"'''Bunny'''"''' Berigan'''</u>. The quotation marks are not put in bold. <u>If a person has a well-known common [[hypocorism]], used in lieu of a given name, it is ''not'' presented between quote marks following the last given name or initial, as for [[Tom Hopper]] which has '''Thomas Edward Hopper'''.</u> Also acceptable are formulations like "'''Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi''', better known as '''Sandro Botticelli'''", when applicable.}}
</br></br>
:For Proposal 2, it is also suggested to include a footnote in the Notes section, with the link at "commonly used hypocorism" above: <small>{{xt|As a guide to what is a "common" hypocorism, consider consulting the [[Hypocorism#English]] subsections "Shortening, often to the first syllable" and "Addition of a diminutive suffix..."; consider treating names listed in the in "A short form that differs significantly from the name" subsection as non-hypocoristic nicknames, depending on the particular case (a few short forms that differ significantly from the name are well known common hypocorisms, such as "Bob" for "Robert", but most are not.}}</small> [[User:Herostratus|Herostratus]] ([[User talk:Herostratus|talk]]) 17:31, 3 November 2016 (UTC)}}

In [[Talk:Center_for_Security_Policy#Should_the_BBC.27s_description_of_the_CSP_be_Included.3F|this RfC]] it was determined that the specific description of the CSP as "not very highly respected" must be included in the article's lede. There is now disagreement as to where it should be placed in the lede between two alternate versions. Which of the two contested versions should be used? 
:'''Version A:''' The Center for Security Policy (CSP) is a "not very highly respected" Washington, D.C.-based national security think tank that has been widely accused of engaging in conspiracy theorizing by a range of individuals, media outlets and organizations. Its activities are focused on exposing and researching perceived jihadist threats to the United States. The Center has been described as "disreputable" by Salon and the Southern Poverty Law Center designated the CSP as a hate group in 2016. It has faced strong criticism from people across the political spectrum, but has also had its reports cited by political figures such as Donald Trump and Michele Bachmann.

 allows the community to educate companies upfront and directly that promotional editing is not allowed under any username. Additionally, some companies – especially paid editing firms – would continue to create new, nondescript usernames anyway to evade scrutiny, defeating the purpose of the proposal. Finally, the kind of companies who would most likely create such shared, role accounts are non-notable and unsuitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, making it pointless for them to continue editing here.

::One potential area to move forward on is improving the connection between soft-blocked usernames that imply shared use and the new usernames that are created as a result of those blocks. A few proposed suggestions include a software change that forces a user to change their username on their next login (supported by {{U|WereSpielChequers}} and {{U|MER-C}}) and creating a policy of coming back under a account like “John123 (WidgetsInc)” (a brainstormed suggestion by {{U|Ks0stm}}). This would allow us to continue the goal of educating users about COI editing while eliminating the need for shared accounts. I would encourage further discussion along those lines if this is something that we want.

Should it be presented as a music genre and placed in band infoboxes? It is basically a term that appears in a few publications on progressive rock (sometimes in quotes or in sentences like "X could be termed post-progressive") and that is not widely used or recognized as such; there are no bands commonly described as ''post-progressive''. It was also placed in a number of infoboxes on music genres (eg. in [[jazz]] and [[ambient music]]) and in the lead in [[progressive rock]], perhaps giving it undue importance. An article on this topic was [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Post-prog|deleted in 2006]]. Another issue is that the sources listed use ''post-progressive'' as an adjective - should the article use it as a noun as it currently does?

The existing language at that time:

Any new writing, including article drafts and talk-page comments, can be freely copied, modified, deleted, reproduced, altered and quoted by third parties for commercial and non-commercial use, with the sole requirement that the work be attributed to Wikipedia contributors.</blockquote>

Was initially  changed and then changed further, and and is currently):

<blockquote>'''Copyright of paid contributions
{{see|Work for hire}}
Editors are reminded that any text they contribute to Wikipedia, assuming they own the copyright, is irrevocably licensed under a [[WP:CC-BY-SA|Creative Commons-Attribution-Sharealike]] license and the [[WP:GFDL|GNU Free Documentation License]]. Content on Wikipedia, including article drafts and talk-page comments, can be freely copied and modified by third parties for commercial and non-commercial use, with the sole requirement that it be attributed to Wikipedia contributors.

Paid editors must ensure that they own the copyright of text they have been paid to add to Wikipedia. If the text is a [[work for hire]], the copyright resides with the person or organization that paid for it ("the employer"). Otherwise the text's author is assumed to be the copyright holder. It is important not to assume that the paid editor is the author, because companies may provide paid editors with approved texts.

Paid editors, the employer, or the author should forward a release to the Wikimedia Foundation (<code>permissions@wikimedia.org</code>). The release must include the name(s) of the author and copyright holder, and that the copyright holder has released the text under a free licence. See [[WP:PERMISSION]] for how to do this.</blockquote>

The notion in the  3rd paragraph that paid editors should always -- whether they own the copyright in the proposed content or not -- forward a release to the Wikimedia Foundation, was discussed at the talk page of the Copyright policy, also in December 2015 starting the same day the content was initially added.  That discussion is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Copyrights/Archive_15#Works_for_hire here].

I have proposed to combine and change the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs to read as follows:

<blockquote>If the copyright for a text that a paid editor wishes to add to Wikipedia is owned by someone else (such as the paid editor's employer), the paid editor is responsible for ensuring that they have the right to grant the required license for the content, or that the copyright owner has granted permission for the content to be used in Wikipedia. See [[WP:PERMISSION]] for instructions.</blockquote>

That version does not include the general obligation but makes it clear that paid editors, like everyone, are responsible for getting clearance to add content to WP that they don't own.

The question:   Should paid editors always be obligated to have copyright permission sent to WMF for content they wish to add to WP, whether they own it or not?  [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]] ([[User talk:Jytdog|talk]]) 20:51, 15 December 2016 (UTC)}}

Still other feelings are that Trump has not held prior political office. Another feeling is that mentioning politician if the only political office held is president because it is redundant.

An examination of other articles of Presidents show that generally they are not called politicians in the lead.

This discussion was prompted by the Trump article but is brought here for the improvement of all Wikipedia presidential articles.

{{rfcquote|text=
I would like to put forward an important discussion in regards to the information that has been put out in the articles that cover each series of ''The Apprentice (UK)''. This discussion is an important one that needs to be looked into, as I, an editor for this site, have begun to question whether the information in these articles is encyclopedic, or whether the articles are beginning to become treated as a Blog, which Wikipedia is not designed as.  As an editor who has worked on these pages, I have been a part of adding in information to discuss the respective episodes, but have begun to question whether the information being put in by myself, and other editors, regardless of whether it is later changed, added to, or deleted, is now really relevant, and more importantly sticks to Wikipedia's principle of providing encyclopedic information.

The chief problem on these articles is in regards to information on episodes.  The layout for this information is that it states the Air Date for each episode in each series, the teams and their candidates within, the task being undertaken on that episode and a review of what happened, results of the task and who won and what they were rewarded with, who was brought back to the final boardroom, who was fired or left, the panellist for the sister show that came after that episode, and notes in regards to events in the episode (i.e. a candidate who made a mistake and tried to lie about it).

Other information in this article, from the lead, the candidate and weekly results, criticism and controversy, and ratings, appears to be fine, with some area certainly backed by citations to prove it.  What I want to know is this - Should the information within the Episode section of each article for these series, be changed or stick to the way it is presented? Does it constitute as being a Blog and thus go against [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]] in regards to this?  And if the first two questions generate "Yes" as an answer, would changing it to listing the episodes in a table, keeping the Air Date and the episode's title, and writing out a short summary of the episode (as with most TV programmes), be more appropriate?

I await word from others on what they think. [[User:GUtt01|GUtt01]] ([[User talk:GUtt01|talk]]) 23:03, 17 November 2016 (UTC)}}

For those who don't know, the [[User:StatisticianBot|bot]] that previously updated [[Wikipedia:Good article nominations/Report]] has been down for some time. I'm currently working on a replacement, [[User:WugBot|WugBot]] (see [[Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/WugBot|BRFA]]). [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] and I have been [[User_talk:Wugapodes#WugBot_output|discussing]] where the links on that page should point to. Currently I have it set up so that the links go directly to the review page of the article (if it exists, to the talk page otherwise) which is different from how the predecesor, StatisticianBot, formatted the links. Previously, the links would go to the GAN page and jump to the section where the nomination is. BlueMoonset makes a good case for the previous format, but I think we'd both like to hear wider input on what others would prefer.

'''TL;DR''': Where should the links on [[Wikipedia:Good article nominations/Report]] point, the GAN page as previously, the article's review page as currently, or some other option?

{{rfcquote|text=
No-one's formally proposed this solution above, but it certainly has received a lot of support. Let's see if there's actual consensus for it. I propose changing the text of [[WP:NOQUORUM]] to the following:

{{blockquote|If a nomination has received no comments from any editor besides the nominator and the article hasn't been declined for proposed deletion in the past, the closing administrator should treat the AfD nomination as an expired PROD. Generally, this will result in soft deletion (see below), but administrators should evaluate the nominating statement as they would a PROD rationale. See [[WP:PROD]] for more details.

If the nomination has received very few comments, has received no comments but appears controversial to the closing administrator, or has been declined for proposed deletion in the past, the discussion may be closed at the closer's discretion and best judgement. Common options include, but are not limited to:

* relisting the discussion (see the section '[[#Relisting discussions|Relisting discussions]]');
* closing as "no consensus" with no prejudice against speedy renomination ('''NPASR'''); and
* closing in favour of the nominator's stated proposal.
* '''Soft deletion''' is a special kind of deletion which may be used after an article's deletion discussion. If a deletion discussion sees very little discussion even after being relisted several times, the administrator can close the discussion as soft delete and delete the page. However, in this case, the article can be restored for any reason on request. If your article was soft-deleted, you can request it be restored at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion|Requests for undeletion]].  The closer should make it clear the deletion is a soft delete as part of the close, ideally with a link to this guideline.
* There is consensus among the community that problematic or likely-problematic articles<ref>Usually articles unreferenced for years.</ref> with an appropriate redirection target may be [[WP:BLAR|blanked and redirected]] by any editor if there are no objections. This similarly applies to deletion nominations as well; if no editor suggests that the corresponding article should be kept, then redirection is an option.}}

{{reftalk}}

Note that most of the text is the same, but I have cut out a "special case" where no comments have been made other than the nominator, in which case the nomination will be treated as an expired PROD. In the spirit of our current PROD process, articles that have had a PROD declined will not be considered as expired PRODs, since PRODs are meant to occur only once per article. ~ [[User:BU Rob13|<b>Rob</b><small><sub>13</sub></small>]]<sup style="margin-left:-1.0ex;">[[User talk:BU Rob13|Talk]]</sup> 01:03, 21 November 2016 (UTC)}}

So I am in the process of cleaning up deprecated parameters from templates. This template has a number of them. During a discussion about these parameters (see above) it came to light that some parameters in the template are all one word (for example {{param|foobar}}) while others have an underscore (such as {{param|foo_bar}}. The question on the table is regarding making all the template parameters consistent. I will gladly be responsible for changing the transclusions (it will be done with a bot), updating the template and the template documentation, etc. I just want to make sure that a consensus is reached! For simplicity sake, the question on the table for '''support''' or '''oppose''' is:
:''Should all multi-word parameters in the template (such as {{param|expansiondraftyear}}) be formatted to use underscores (i.e. {{param|expansion_draft_year}}.''
Obviously all comments comments are welcome! Not just support/oppose. Looking forward to hearing all input! Also if there are additional parameters that are deprecated and should be removed, let's be sure to get that well documented so I can hit them all when I run my bot. --[[User:Zackmann08|<span style="color:DarkTurquoise;">Zackmann08</span>]] (<sup>[[User_talk:Zackmann08|Talk to me]]</sup>/<sub>[[Special:Contributions/Zackmann08|<span style="color:orange;">What I been doing</span>]]</sub>) 06:18, 25 November 2016 (UTC)}}

We have a June 2016 [[Cochrane review]] that states "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27339435 Patients with CFS may generally benefit and feel less fatigued following exercise therapy, and no evidence suggests that exercise therapy may worsen outcomes.]"

;Option 1 (proposed by Doc James)
As this is an important point I propose we add "'''Exercise therapy does not appear to make people worse.'''" to the third paragraph of the lead.

;Option 2 (proposed by Doc James)
Other wording could include "'''There is no evidence of harm from exercise.'''"

We seem to be using terms like "win" and "lose" fast and loose. Can we take a moment to build a consensus as to what it means to "lose" the popular vote so we have an objective standard to measure future edits and avoid edit-warring? Here are a few options: 
#Lose the Popular Vote means to Secure Less than 50% of the Popular Vote
#Lose the Popular Vote means to Secure Fewer Popular Votes than the Person who Received the Most Popular Votes 
#Lose the Popular Vote means to Secure Fewer Popular Votes than Any Other Candidate 
<small>'''If standard #1''' is adopted, Donald Trump would have lost the popular vote in 2016 (along with every other candidate, but this would not materially change the article since he would still be listed as a president who "won" despite "losing").

This article was recently created by me, and shortly thereafter [[User:Bearcat]] disputed the neutrality of this article. Without discussion, an anonymous editor using [http://www.gogoair.com/ airplane Wi-Fi] proceeded to remove a lot of referenced information which he [[WP:IDONTLIKEIT|must not have liked]]. A neutral tone is important, and making the language a little less harsh is understandable, but removing referenced information is [[whitewashing]] and a general disservice to readers of Wikipedia. The overwhelming majority of sources criticize the website. [http://www.snopes.com/fox-news-benghazi-probe-hoax/ Snopes has debunked articles published by Bipartisan Report]. This website is documented in reliable sources as essentially being something ran out of someone's basement, using far-fetched headlines as [[click bait]], and the operator of the website doesn't even contest that. In my opinion, this article is not even worth keeping with only three sentences. The article, as it stands now, barely demonstrates [[WP:N|notability]], and it's debatable if it demonstrates it at all since this website is proof that anyone with an internet connected device can make a site "claiming" to be the world's largest newspaper, just as any 13 year old girl can claim to be the world's best soccer player on her Facebook page. I do believe, however, that the article met the requirements of inclusion prior to the reduction in content, as there were numerous [[WP:RS|sources]] cited.

{{rfcquote|text=
:Background: [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Abortion advocacy movement coverage]] and [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Abortion article titles]] from 2012. Wikipedia has never been quite sure how to refer to the abortion activism movements, and currently the article titles are set from a narrow consensus at [[Abortion-rights movements]] and [[Anti-abortion movements]]. This RFC instead asks the question: how can we refer to the movements in article prose? This question is necessary because the status quo has gradually settled on a certain balance and I contend that that status is entirely out of balance, a clear and present violation of [[WP:NPOV|Wikipedia's core neutrality policy]] and an affront to the supporters of both movements.
*What is the current status quo? Abortion-rights movements are referred to as "[[pro-choice]]" for example [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] and [[Planned Parenthood]] and [[:Category:Pro-choice organizations in the United States]]. The only place "[[pro-life]]" survives is [[:Category:American pro-life activists]], a holdout from the Great Renaming in which cats were mostly moved to "anti-abortion", which is the current status quo term for the so-called [[anti-abortion movements]]. Editors simply will not allow anyone or anything to be called "pro-life", whether or not the topic in question clearly transcends anti-abortion, or a preponderance of [[WP:RS]] describe the topic as "pro-life", which would seem to violate [[WP:V]] and [[WP:OR]].
:Therefore, the logic would suggest that "pro-choice", a biased non-neutral term used only by supporters to describe themselves, should be eliminated in order to level the playing field. It is the only way to comply with [[WP:NPOV]] if we are to avoid accusations of [[WP:SYSTEMIC]] bias which would be indicated by the way that the pro-abortion position is given the largesse to self-identify while pro-life is not. So the questions before us are:
# '''How will we refer to abortion-rights movements in article prose?''' (a) pro-abortion (b) pro-choice (c) abortion rights
# '''How will we refer to anti-abortion movements in article prose?''' (a) anti-abortion (b) pro-life (c) opposition to abortion rights
:I suggest that the outcome of this RFC should become binding project-wide so that we have a clear and consistent method of referring to these topics that will not be the subject of constant contention and edit-wars without any clear resolution.

Hi, Long story short back in December {{noping|Kind Tennis Fan}} had converted the entire article to MDY[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christmas&diff=695844019&oldid=695605220] - There was no consensus for this nor was there any discussion, So having seen Walter Görlitz convert all dates to MDY I then had converted everything to YMD, Since then there's been a disagreement/edit war over this so I wanted to get a wider discussion as to what should be used or done,<br />
I had attempted to revert back to Dec 2015 and readd all of the edits however it would've took forever and was way too much so I had self-reverted and decided to start an RFC, Thanks, –[[User:Davey2010|<span style="color:#147A44;">'''Davey'''</span><span style="color:#C4061C;">'''2010'''</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Davey2010|<span style="color:#147A44;">Merry Xmas</span> / <span style="color:#C4061C;">Happy New Year</span>]]</sup> 23:34, 27 December 2016 (UTC)}}

This request for comments has been created in order to determine what should be done about a user who, late last July, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Augstn&offset=&limit=250&target=Augstn completely revamped] this page for the worse and whom I suspect used a second account by the name of [[User:Bndktfanta]] when doing so. Some may argue that it can be forgiven and forgotten because (s)he was a new editor, but I think that his/her edits show an abundantly clear wish to give the article bias, that they unquestionably constitute [[WP:Vandalism|vandalism]], and that they are too substantial for such brushing off. Because of the changes made since then, his/her edits cannot be [[WP:Rollback|rolled back]]. How do we go about fixing this page and preventing something like this from happening in the future?

I suggest this article could do with a rewrite.  I propose to base this on neutral academic [[WP:SECONDARY]] sources, rather than the [[WP:PRIMARY]] sources it is currently based upon.  This has been opposed with the comment that the article should only be based on [[WP:PRIMARY]] sources, principally political speeches and statements by the parties.  I propose to use:

*Thomas D. Musgrave (2000). Self-Determination and National Minorities. Oxford University Press. p. 239. ISBN 978-0-19-829898-4.
*Simon J. Lincoln (1994). The Legal Status of Gibraltar: Whose Rock is it Anyway? Fordham International Law Journal. Volume 18, Issue 1, Article 8.

This article is more likely to be written in [[American English]] than British due to the country's history as a possession of the the [[United States]]. It, along with other [[Central American]] countries, such as the [[Dominican Republic]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Panama]] were under American hegemony most of the 20th century. Panama and the Dominican Republic were even briefly occupied. A request to include the template [[Template:American English|American English]] be included in the talk pages of the articles.

{{rfcquote|text=
[[Wikipedia:Stand-alone lists|Stand-alone lists]] are defined as ''"articles composed of one or more embedded lists, or series of items formatted into a list."'' The current [[Wikipedia:Good article criteria#What cannot be a good article?|good article criteria]] mentions that stand-alone lists should be nominated directly as [[WP:FL|featured lists]] rather than as good articles. Currently, there are a few lists that have good article status: for example, [[List of counties in Delaware]], [[List of Ops (B) staff]] and more... As lists are technically defined as articles, and as there may be lists that may perhaps qualify to be ''good articles'' before being improved to featured list standards, editors may be motivated to develop good quality lists if lists (in other words, articles by definition) may be allowed to be nominated for GA status. In this context, I request for the comments of my fellow editors to the following queries:

#''"Should stand-alone lists be allowed to be nominated as [[WP:GA|good articles]]?"''
#''"Should a new criteria of Good List status be introduced instead of qualifying lists as Good Articles?"''
#''"Should we continue status quo, that is, not change anything and let it continue as it is?"''
