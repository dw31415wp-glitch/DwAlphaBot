'''Should the names of [[Breed standard|standardized breeds]] of domesticated animals be capitalized on Wikipedia,''' to match the published breed standards?  They presently are, with near uniformity, and the practice is almost universally followed in breeds-specific writing, but notably less often in more general writing (except where a breed name is or contains a proper name like "Ennstal Mountain" or "Siamese").

I've been neutral on the question for several years (though arguing at [[WP:RM]] to follow a particular pattern in the interim, for [[WP:CONSISTENCY]] policy reasons). '''I have collected every single {{lang|la|pro}} or {{lang|la|con}} argument I've encountered on this question, at [[WP:BREEDCASE]]''', immediately below which is an index of previous discussions. This may be worth a skim before you respond to this RfC.  My interest in seeing the question answered by clear community consensus is to close the gaping hole in MOS:LIFE (it needs to either state that standardized breeds are an exception, or that they are not), and to complete the [[MOS:ORGANISMS]] in-depth guideline, which has been stuck in draft state for over six years due to this one question not being resolved (though it is followed aside from the breeds question).<br /><span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''']] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] 😼 </span> 20:41, 9 December 2018 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
We have an article about [[coequalizer]]s, which are dual to equalizers in category theory. But there is currently a spelling variant inconsistency. Should we therefore harmonize the spelling for [[Equaliser (mathematics)]] and [[Coequalizer]]? If so, then we need to decide whether we should use the British "ise" spelling for both, or the American "ize" spelling for both. On the one hand, if "ise" should be used for both articles, then "Equaliser (mathematics)" should stay at its current spelling and "Coequalizer" should be moved to "Coequaliser". On the other hand, if "ize" should be used for both articles, then "Equaliser (mathematics)" should be moved to "Equalizer (mathematics)" and "Coequalizer" should stay at its current spelling.

 Should [[Leap Year]] page include a computer programming example on how to calculate leap years?

Editors of the [[Leap Year]] page argue [[WP:NOTHOWTO]] (but nevertheless provide a textual algorithm). However, [[WP:BB]] argues that providing a real programming example in the very place that is turned to by many programmers makes the encyclopedia better ([[WP:FATRAT]]).

I have disclosed my COI numerous times. There is a lot of linguistic misunderstandings and scientific understandings around linguistics in regard to the digital dependencies, specifically "addiction" vs "dependence", "social media addiction" as a "diagnostic category", and several others are notable. I'd like to know whether we are able to mention the psychiatric category of ADHD whilst commenting that a prominent psychologist is suggesting a meta scientific ontological discussion about the whole diagnostic category, under the psychology section. Finally there is one very high quality trial about ADHD symptoms and "digital media use" that explain only correlations and do not draw conclusions. It's not allowed to be on either this page or [[social media addiction]] which I suggest may not give it weight. This may give false balance to the non existence of a correlation with "symptoms" only. I am trying to consider all [[WP:MEDRS]] policies and especially [[WP:SYNTH]] policies here very carefully. I cannot do this on my own. Thankyou very much to all involved contributors! [[User:E.3|E.3]] ([[User talk:E.3|talk]]) 05:16, 10 January 2019 (UTC)}}

There is a lot of confusion in my opinion in this page as to how MEDRS applies. We have a high quality, well reported (worldwide reported and cited) about social media (Pokemon Go) namely being correlated but not causative to ADHD. They don't say the three words "social media addiction" in this study. Therefore ADHD is not allowed to be mentioned, and the rest of the previous edits I have made become worthless. I have removed all [[WP:SYNTH]] as best as I am able with the kind assistance of these same editors. 
EU Consensus statement around ADHD states internet use. But not "social media addiction". Also hyper focus causing problematic internet use. Not "social media addiction" No meta analysis around ADHD is allowed to be used. Nothing from any other field is allowed to be used because of MEDRS, which is why I created [[digital dependencies and global mental health]]. This page always has content removed, sometimes appropriately, but [[digital addict]] does not. I have just discussed with some experts and that is because they are moving away from this terminology, being so stigmatising to the afflicted people. It however means we are unable to use any reliable source such as guidelines, EU consensus statements, metaanalyses etc. 
I am the only person really adding anything to the page, everyone reads MEDRS slightly differently as to how it applies here. This is a unique page in regard to MEDRS because it is so current. It is of high importance, regardless of what the portals in this page have stated. The suggestions I was given to add re internet addiction metaanalyses were already deleted prior to the suggestion, because of the linguistics. Expert opinion (even when they all say the same thing, using slightly different words) is deleted. I think we need clarification from uninvolved editors as to how MEDRS applies to this, and whether exemptions may apply. This is a high importance medical issue, and we cannot with this impasse make it encyclopedic at all, in my opinion the article as it stands is useless.

===Request'''

'''The article should to be changed to refect the following:'''

'''The more recent accounts section should include:'''

Jiyu-Kennett Roshi, a 20th-century Soto Zen Master who was the first Western female Zen Master, and founded both Shasta and Throssel Hole Abbeys, published a highly detailed personal account of her kensho experiences in her book, ''How to Grow a Lotus Blossom''{{sfn|Kennett|1993|}}. In it, she described three different stages of kensho experience, along with a fourth that can occur at the time of death:
#A first stage, "initial glimpse" kensho, that most Zen practitioners eventually experience, and that are often used as the later basis for qualification for Dharma Transmission
#A second, ongoing Fugen kensho or, "the little moments that make one dance"{{sfn|Kennett|1993|}} experienced by practitioners with a continual, stable practice 
#A third stage kensho, that can involve past life recall, profound spiritual visions, and deep awakening experiences that go beyond what is experienced in the first kensho.

Finally a fourth stage is described as Parinirvana itself, experienced by rare practitioners who achieve Buddhahood upon time of death.{{sfn|Kennett|1993|}} 
{{quote|"In the first kenshō the stages flash by so quickly that the whole kenshō is only comprehended as one flash. One goes, as it were, from earth to heaven by rocket, or as a lightning bolt, with no time to take notice of the journey before one has arrived. The third kenshō takes place slowly and deliberately with plenty of time to comprehend each step of the way. For example, in the first kenshō one jumps, of necessity, beyond the opposites and ''knows'' for ever afterwards that one ''has'' jumped. In the third kenshō the opposites are looked at slowly and dispassionately and then ''deliberately'' discarded; the first kenshō is a swift comprehension of grace; the third kenshō ''starts'' as a ''deliberate'' act of will." {{sfn|Kennett|1993|p=xxiv-xxv}}}}
Her description of kensho stages is interesting, in that it closely parallels those of Dzogchen and Theravada stages as well. 

'''Reasoning:'''
Because Jiyu-Kennett was a highly influential and Zen Master, famous for being the first western woman to become a Zen master, and she also established a two training monasteries, and dozens of temples and meditation groups worldwide which continue to be a sizable portion of the Soto Zen world. She is also the only person to my knowledge who ever published an entire book on the subject of kensho, and had numerous unique experiences on the matter, which are of relevance to this article. Additionally, adding a woman's perspective on kensho, increases the diversity of views, and historically, women's views within Zen have not been as well represented.

'''Additionally, the subsection on Soto Zen views should be updated with this information as well. Reasoning: consistency in the article.'''

'''Additionally, the section at the end related to similarities to other traditions should be include sections on the four visions under Dzogchen:'''

The Japanese term kensho is similar to the Dzogchen teachings of the Four Visions.

The '''four visions''' (Tib. [[སྣང་བ་བཞི་]], ''nangwa shyi'', [[Wyl.]] ''snang ba bzhi'') of [[tögal]] are:

#direct realization of reality itself (Tib. [[ཆོས་ཉིད་མངོན་སུམ་]], ''chönyi ngön sum''; Wyl. ''chos nyid mngon sum'')
#increasing experience (Tib. [[ཉམས་གོང་འཕེལ་]], ''nyam gong pel''; Wyl. ''nyams gong ‘phel'')	
#awareness reaching full maturity (Tib. [[རིག་པ་ཚད་ཕེབས་]], ''rigpa tsé pep''; Wyl. ''rig pa tshad phebs'')
#dissolution of experience into the nature of reality (Tib. [[ཆོས་ཉིད་ཟད་ས་]], ''chönyi zésa'', ''chönyi zépa'' or ''chözé lodé''; Wyl.''chos nyid zad sa'')

The Dzogchen-traditions states that the ultimate nature of all sentient beings is ''pure, all-encompassing, primordial awareness'', or ''naturally occurring timeless awareness''. This intrinsic awareness has no form of its own, and yet is capable of perceiving, experiencing, reflecting, or expressing all form. It does so without being affected by those forms in any ultimate, permanent way.

The analogy given by Dzogchen masters is that one's nature is like a mirror which reflects with complete openness, but is not affected by the reflections. [[Rigpa]] is the knowledge that ensues from recognizing this mirror-like clarity,{{sfn|Namdak|2006|p=97}} which cannot be found by searching nor identified.{{sfn|Third Dzogchen Rinpoche|2008|p=152}} One ''knows'' that there is a primordial freedom from grasping his or her mind.{{sfn|Namdak|2006|p=144-145}}

'''Reasoning'''
The Four Visions are of direct similarity and therefor would be of relevance and interest to readers of the article.

*Closing AFD as keep with instructions that merge can be handled at the article.

:I have seen this more than once on an article at AFD, an example concerning duplicate content at [[WP:Articles for deletion/Tabiti]], that can result in a [[WP:NOT#DICTIONARY|dictionary entry]], when there is clear evidence leaning towards merge, or where merge was a better option, or needed for obvious policy and guideline reasoning, and it was closed as "Keep" supposedly because merge can be discussed on the article talk page. 
:The lead on this main page includes "Merge": ''"Common outcomes are that the article is kept, merged, redirected, incubated, renamed/moved to another title, userfied to a user subpage, or deleted per the deletion policy. Disambiguation pages are also nominated for deletion at AfD."''. 
:[[WP:ATD-M]] states ''"If two pages are duplicates or otherwise redundant, one should be merged and redirected to the other, using the most common, or more general page name. '''This does not require process or formal debate beforehand'''."''. A reason for a merge option at AFD is because local editors (consensus) can turn this into a battle on its own. A note at WP:ATD-M:

*''Note that an outcome of "merge and delete" may potentially cause licensing problems if attribution for the merged content is lost in the process. The essay [[Wikipedia:Merge and delete]] discusses this, whereas the essay [[Wikipedia:Delete or merge]] discusses a different case that causes no such licensing problems.''.
This clearly shows merge as an AFD option, and if performed by an admin removes battleground issues and listed potential licensing problems. 

:It does not seem logical to make a process circular so that an end result is aggravation, loss of editor interest, editors not wanting to add merge as an option, and articles remaining that should not exist. On Wikipedia there is "Keep" and "Delete". Any consensus other than "keep" is a delete no matter how you look at it. If an article at AFD has two "keeps", one "delete", and two "Merge" or "redirect" it will likely result in "no consensus". I don't see the confusion because anything other than keep is still a delete so it would seem this would dictate consideration. That is just my opinion but might edge editors to agree more to merge.  
:There needs to be some clarity on ignoring valid merge criterion and remanding an article back to local consensus for a circular battle. Attempts at [[WP:cleanup|cleanup]] should not have to be so complicated and in fact this is counter to above policy. If there is some Admin reasoning not shared with editors it would be good to know this.  [[User:Otr500|Otr500]] ([[User talk:Otr500|talk]]) 17:47, 17 December 2018 (UTC)}}

I can do this using my bot. There is a feature on WPCleaner called "Update ISBN warning messages" on WPCleaner. I have been having a discussion about this feature around two weeks ago. The discussion can be found [[Wikipedia talk:WPCleaner#ISBN warnings]]. The feature adds and removes ISBN warning messages on the talk pages of the affected articles. It tells the ISBN that is affected and it also tell the reason why the ISBN is affected. This will help Wikipedians fix ISBNs much more easily on English Wikipedia. The template is at [[User:NicoV/ISBN Warning]] at the moment. This needs to be moved to [[:Template:ISBN warning]]. The talk pages with an ISBN warning message will be added into [[:Category:Articles with invalid ISBNs]]. The WPCleaner script can add the warning message for the affected articles and remove the warning message for the articles that have been fixed automatically. I have tested this on [[User:Pkbwcgs/sandbox|my sandbox]] and it works. This feature is already available on French Wikipedia and [[User:NicoV]] kindly said that he can configure WPCleaner so that this can also happen at the English Wikipedia. The output looks like this:<br/>
{{User:NicoV/ISBN Warning|0-123-456-78|The ISBN has only nine digits instead of ten so it is invalid.}}
Shall we have this brilliant feature which will help the identification of incorrect ISBNs on English Wikipedia? [[User:Pkbwcgs|Pkbwcgs]] ([[User talk:Pkbwcgs|talk]]) 10:19, 31 December 2018 (UTC)}}

I am here to address some issues within the article. "Location" should be used, as it is a valid parameter per {{TI|Infobox concert}}. If anything, the division of "total number of dates" should just state the total amount. Infoboxes are meant to present an overdue of data. If visitors want to know the exact amount of dates, they can go below and see them. As much, "world" is proper for "type" of tour, as this is a world tour and is promoted as such. Yes, it is a concert tour, but it is also a "world" tour — see good-article [[War Tour]] for an example. In addition, the removal of "end date" is wrong, as the end date, as of now, is known. If additional dates are added, it can be changed. As such, {{TI|TableTBA}} should be used, as it is visually built for tables to match the table set up. Not to mention, using "rowspan" for the attendance is wrong, as each date is separate, and it implies that BOTH dates will share the same data, which they will likely not.

Let’s analyze, objectively, can we, everyone. Now 11 of the sources given here are of models.com slides. Some Wikipedia administrators express that models.com is not a reliable source. 1 source is fashionmodeldirectory.com aka the IMDb of models. Some administrators express that fashionmodeldirectory is not a reliable source, to stand on its own. 1 source given is Fashionista.com, with a one sentence quote. I’ve never seen Fashionista.com, which is a blog, considered as a reliable source. 1 source, which admittedly I placed years ago is of YouTube (goes without saying). 1 source is NYMag’s model profile which is not used to contribute to notability, if it really is for notability then the same logic can be used to refund the page of [http://nymag.com/fashion/models/jdunstall/juliadunstall/ Julia Dunstall]. 4 sources are simply slideshows of runway shows that are not editorials for Vogue magazine or even remotely related to Vogue magazins itself but for some reason wrongly identified as such. 1 source is about Prada’s casting standard where the subject is mentioned as part of a small group, while others get whole paragraphs. 1 source is T Magazine by NYT who ask her questions like “Twitter or Instagram?” and “what time do you get out of bed?” So that '''only leaves''' Vogue Italia, who has a brief career summary with a slideshow of runway shows. Having that only one independent source is not in any regard enough for general notability or significant coverage for a page. In any way shape or form. That’s why I [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kätlin Aas|proposed deletion of this page]].

So how, under these circumstances, has the article “improved” in quality or general notability in any way? When that same standard was previously used to reject model articles with actual [[WP:SIGCOV|significant coverage]] such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ari_Westphal&oldid=837430824 Ari Westphal], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jing_Wen&oldid=796000617 Jing Wen], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alanna_Arrington&oldid=837757887 Alanna Arrington], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maartje_Verhoef&oldid=773873373 Maartje Verhoef], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Willow_Hand&oldid=819579194 Willow Hand], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Duckie_Thot&oldid=838638374 Duckie Thot], who had these same sources? Comments included “appearances do not contribute to notability”, “Not notable sources. Simply announcements and profiles,” and “Not satisfying our simplest standards as the sources are simply announcements, profiles, notices or similar; there's no automatic inherited notability from anything or anyone.”

Bear in mind, none of this is personal I’m just looking for clarity on it. [[User:Trillfendi|Trillfendi]] ([[User talk:Trillfendi|talk]]) 05:24, 13 January 2019 (UTC)}}

As {{code|unblockself}} is now gone but sysops now have the ability to block the admin that blocked them instead, I think it makes sense to update the blocking policy to include language making this clear that it is only to be done in exceptional circumstances such as a compromise and never for the purpose of extending a dispute or getting revenge on the other party: namely since it’s functionally replaces unblockself, it should be viewed through policy as such. Therefore I am proposing the following be added to the blocking policy:

I hate to request comments on this because I'm mentioning Wikipedia's administration.
I un-reverted good edits made by a banned user a week ago but the same Admin re-reverted without elaborating any further.
Those edits seem to be actual improvements (they correct the collapsed table for once), thus is the Admin (using TW) aware of it? And if he/she is, is the blocked status of the sockpuppeting user enough to unrevert those readily good edits like that?
The table reports wrong values that those edits did  correct perfectly, and the original user [[User:SuperSucker]] is rather disruptive than unprepared contributor. [[Special:Contributions/149.254.248.29|149.254.248.29]] ([[User talk:149.254.248.29|talk]]) 11:24, 20 January 2019 (UTC)}}

Put in place an initially voluntary structure to manage discussions on bans and editing restrictions, as follows:
# A templated header (using mandatory SUBST and date substitution like deletion templates) which sets an expectation that an ANI debate on a named sanction will run for at least 7 days, with, as always, the possibility of an early close per [[WP:SNOW]], but a strong expectation that this would normally only happen when the proposal is ''rejected''. The offset to this would be...
# An optional "temporary injunction" which enacts the requested sanction immediately without prejudice during the debate - thus an IBAN, TBAN or block would be put in place until the debate is concluded, then either lifted without implication of wrongdoing or made permanent depending on the outcome. This would be requested by the filing party and then reviewed by an uninvolved admin, as with arbitration sanctions
So, run ANI block/ban discussions much more on the lines of AE, but with ANI's bigger audience. 21:07, 17 January 2019 (UTC)}}

The article of a basketball player [[Ersan_İlyasova#Personal_life|has a section describing]] an incident where Uzbekistan made an arbitration bid that the subject is an Uzbekistani national. The court instead ruled in Turkey's favor. The details are all well except the last line.

This is a singular cited article (same cite repeated twice) but the language used is in the plural. The cited article has also been pulled (dead link) but the language used ("other biographies...still maintain") is in the present-tense. Bios are supposed to be up-to-date, we shouldn't rely on a pulled link from the past on a controversial statement (which may or may not be accurate) to make a present-tense statement.

Nonetheless, even if we have additional cites we add in, it is still a dueweight issue because the lines before it already describe the dispute/incident in a concise and neutral manner. Why is the article '''repeating''' on a point as if to hammer it in? This is UNDUEWEIGHT. 

Additionally, I have noticed another issue. The paragraph at first describes "The controversy is fueled by the claim that a man named Arsen Illyasov..." then in the next line states that Uzbekistan made this argument to the court. The fact that this argument presented by Uzbekistan is where the controversy stems from, it '''should be disclosed first''' and ''then'' the claim should be detailed. Not the other way around. I believe this also violates [[WP:DUE]], which states:
{{quote frame|1=Undue weight can be given in several ways, including but not limited to depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, juxtaposition of statements and imagery.}}

This was my initial edit: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ersan_%C4%B0lyasova&diff=875398906&oldid=875021399] It was reverted and we have a dispute between us. [[User:DA1|DA1]] ([[User talk:DA1|talk]]) 22:11, 27 December 2018 (UTC)}}

Hi {{ping|Electric-Balls}} How are you? I saw your question and the revert to the [[The Gantocks]]. I've reverted it. It is nothing to to with a referendum politics, Scotland being part of the UK. It is the question of geography and only geography. It is firmly in Scotland, and within Wikipedia where we refer to the locating country for everything. Only the Scotland portal is specific in this instance. You also need to be more specific.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should those who have plead the [[Alford plea]] in a court of law have their articles parenthetically disambiguated with (criminal)? 

A bit of background: 

The [[Alford plea]] is a plea in the court of law, which means the defendant pleaded "guilty" to save themselves from worse punishment. This plea is mostly plead in murder or manslaughter cases where. The evidence against them is so convincing, that the court would find them guilty (and the judge does not dismiss the trial) and if they pleaded "not guilty" they may face punishment such as the death penalty, so scared them into pleading guilty for a lesser sentence.

Take the article [[Michael Peterson (criminal)]]. He was convicted of murder, but then because an expert witness in the case was found to have provided false and inaccurate information on other cases the court gave him a retrial. In this retrail he plead the [[Alford plea]] and subsequently was sentenced to 
86 months in prison with credit, so was released from jail has he had served longer than that.

Therefore, the defendant has only plead "guilty" to save themselves, but still think they are "not guilty". This raises the question: Does pleading the [[Alford plea]] make someone a "criminal" in the eyes of the wiki?

This was brought to my attention through the discussion I had with {{u|Gazeboist}} on [[User talk:Dreamy Jazz/Archive 2#Michael Iver Peterson|my talk page]] and am opening on their behalf. Some important points in their message to me:
:{{tq|it is not reasonable to describe him as "convicted", despite the [[Alford plea]], due to the nature of an Alford plea and the post-conviction relief process in the United States}}
:{{tq|The Alford plea theoretically requires that there be enough evidence to convict a defendant, but in practice it merely requires that the prosecution have enough evidence that a judge will not dismiss the case before trial (as happened in this case). It amounts to an agreement to leave the case perpetually in the state it was in after the conviction was thrown out: Peterson asserts his innocence, but the claim has effectively never gone to trial. The assertion that Peterson is a "criminal" or "murderer" has been found *provable* but it has not been *proven*.}}

Please indicate your '''support'''/'''oppose''' to having the [[Alford plea]] be justification for the "criminal" parenthetical disambiguation. Comments are also welcome.
* '''Support''': [[Alford plea]] IS justification for the "criminal" parenthetical disambiguation
* '''Oppose''': [[Alford plea]] is NOT justification for the "criminal" parenthetical disambiguation

I think it would be easier to come here and talk to you about the truth first.

I had sent email to the writer (Professor.A.Jackson) about the issue and he sent me back to article to read and it showed the real situation about LGBT Rights in Thailand.

Dear Thita Rangsitpol,

You read the paper "Educating Desire: Thailand, Transnationalism, Transgression". There's a paper related to it on Academia that you haven't read yet: 

I check the paper it did not clear my father name that he mentioned. I am not sure why he sent me the paper to read.

'''Politic'''

Both issues was created to outs my father from his administration because his Education Reform had created and impact in Thailand.The Priminister at the time feel threatened by My father that was why this email was sending around the globe.

https://www.outrightinternational.org/content/thailand-gays-and-lesbians-banned-enrolling-teacher-training-schools
this is the original email it does not have my father email on because I call them and explain the situation back in 1997.
She understood and remove my father email from the letter in the link.

My father have never approved the ban because it was against his Education for All Education Reform .Please check and comfirm with  Ministry of Education,Thailand. Thailand had always been friendly country do not let any Political lies confuse you.

It is essential that the government provide educational services that respond to the people's needs. Education, therefore, has to be organized in such a way that people from all walks of life can participate in educational activities at levels and times of their preference.

 

All sort of boundaries, be their gender, age, socio-economic status, physical or mental disabilities have to be eliminated. To achieve this, we have to distinctively promote continuing and lifelong education, the form of education which is responsive to individual needs and preferences. With educational facilities and a variety of educational programs available, people can make use of the learning centre as a place to acquire technical skills or knowledge adaptive to their work and daily life activities.}}

The Minister of Education launched a series of education reforms in 1995. The aim was to enhance the quality of education from 1995 to achieve educational excellence by 2007.

{{quote|The objective of education reform is to create learning individual, organization, and society. An educated person or the authentic learning outcome should possess the following abilities and characteristics which are based on Thai cultural heritage and appropriate level of education: good physical and mental health, critical thinking, intellectual inquisitiveness, professionalism, sense of responsibility, honesty, self-sacrifice, perseverance, team spirit, adherence to democracy, and love for king, country, and religion.}}<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dachakupt |first1=Pimpan |title=The current innovation in curriculum development in Thailand |journal=International Journal of Curriculum Development and Practice|date=1999 |volume=1 |pages=93-101 |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jcrdaen/1/1/1_KJ00006742072/_pdf |accessdate=14 February 2019}}</ref>

* 12 years [[Free education]] for all children provided by the government. The free 12 year education was in The [[1997 constitution of Thailand]].

1) The educational budget increased from 133 billion baht in 1996 to 163 billion baht in 1997 (22.5 percent increase)

2) Since 1996, first grade students have learned English and computer literacy.

3) The professional advance from teacher leve1 6 to teacher leve1 7 without having to submit academic work for consideration was approved by the Thai government 

4) There has been drawn up education policy to raise the standards of education from pre-primary to tertiary education.

5) Free 12 years education for all children provided by the government. The free 12 year education was in The 1997 constitution and that was the first time Thailand had give access to education for all citizens.

Real-life example: [[:user:WikiInspector42]] many times removed templates like {fact}, {disputed} etc from article [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area&type=revision&diff=878245841&oldid=878245365][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area&type=revision&diff=878242156&oldid=878242011][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area&type=revision&diff=878132624&oldid=878132550][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area&type=revision&diff=875919815&oldid=875914159][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area&type=revision&diff=875904841&oldid=875899813]. Recidivism. Warnings do not help (also as "last warning") [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:WikiInspector42#Edit_warring]. I add case to [[:Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism]], however, the administrator's reaction was unacceptable. User:WikiInspector42 got a warning [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWikiInspector42&type=revision&diff=878259341&oldid=878241395], I also [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASubtropical-man&type=revision&diff=878259280&oldid=878258812], but the main point is that vandalism has not been removed. If the article has problems, every user have the right to add templates like {fact} etc to article. There is no doubt here. User:WikiInspector42 has no right to delete templates like {fact} or other added by other user without improving the article or/and consensus (the discussion is under way). Administrator do not distinguish between two things: there may be differences of opinion between the two users but no user can break the rules. If the user deletes the template of {fact} or other from article without correcting the problem or consensus [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area&type=revision&diff=878242156&oldid=878242011], this is vandalism. The problem is that [[:Wikipedia:Vandalism]] nothing writes about removing tags like {fact} or similar, and the administrator did not consider this as vandalism [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&oldid=878248290][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Escape_Orbit&oldid=878266896#Vandalism]. So, I am an experienced user (12 years on Wikipedia, 9 as registered user, about 30,000 editions in two Wikipedias and few other Wikimedia projects) and new user defeated me using stupid Wikipedia system and policy. Does this mean that everyone (even IP and new users) can remove tags from articles and experienced editors can not do anything because if reverted it more than twice, the administrator will not do anything except for the warning of both persons?  I am slowly beginning to regret that I have devoted so much life to the Wikipedia. Does it have to be this way? Can not normally solve such a simple problem? The administrator can always restore the tags, block the article or user, ordinary editor is defenseless against the trolls and the administrator does not want to help. It's not just about this example, there are thousands of such problems. Does anyone have any ideas?

Does article quality really improve and is notability created if the majority of sources are directories that are deemed unreliable by administrators? This is the question that must be settled once and for all. What started at the AfD I have proposed for model Kätlin Aas (on the grounds of meeting NMODEL but not GNG) has become a war of words and ad hominem attacks that I never meant for it to escalate to. For years, administrators have told me and other editors that appearance does not create notability. That models.com is not a reliable source. That New York Magazine’s defunct model profile pages such as [http://nymag.com/fashion/models/cdelevingne/caradelevingne/ this] are just directories that don’t contribute to notability. That things have to be validated by significant coverage to get approved for creation not simply mere mention. Some editors at the AfD for Aas believe the deemed-unreliable source of models.com, profile of New York Magazine, and Model Wall-style interviews are enough to create notability (despite the fact that almost all of Aas’s work cannot be verified outside of said directories) when that is the very thing administrators say is reason for declining articles. And that now those unreliable sources and elastic stretching of notability guidelines has moved her quality from stub to start class. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maartje_Verhoef&oldid=773873373 Exhibit A]. The question is, henceforth for ''all'' models, does meeting notability for NMODEL (things such as an international cover no matter what country, a Prada-exclusive casting, beauty contract, high fashion campaign, etc.) override the [[WP:GNG|general notability guidelines]] for any model? Are they to be related to each other in creation and deletion? Some editors don’t see that this is bigger than my view or opinion, informed by many examples of administrator comments I can provide, or that this isn’t about me trying to be “right”, or that I have any emotional stake in proposed deletion results. I’m just trying to get clarity. This is about policy and how it’s supposed to be executed for all articles without hypocrisy or special favors.

I thought it would be useful to separate out this discussion, as some people in the Draft RFC also proposed, to distinguish it from other issues discussed there and to make things a bit less confused. The question here concerns the '''demonym''' of the country of North Macedonia, namely:
# What should be listed under Demonym(s) in the article 'North Macedonia'
# How to refer to people from North Macedonia in articles e.g. 'Zoran Zaev is a XXX politician', 'Ali Ahmeti is an XXX politician', 'Goran Popov is a XXX football player', 'many XXX residents', 'many prominent XXX musicians' etc.
Ideally (IMO) the answer to the above two should be the same.
Demonym is NOT the same thing as adjectival reference (i.e. North Macedonian Parliament, North Macedonian cuisine etc.), nor ethnicity (which, as far as I can tell, remains unchanged as Macedonian/ethnic Macedonian) and I would recommend setting up separate RFCs for those issues.
Demonym is also ''not necessarily'' the same thing as nationality, as illustrated by the example of North Korea, where the nationality is Korean, listed demonyms are North Korean and Korean, and the demonym used in articles is North Korean.

Based on my reading of the discussion in the Draft RFC, four main views have emerged:
* '''North Macedonian only''' - Match demonym to name of country for minimum confusion and to be able to refer to everyone and everything from the country in the same way, including, for example, people who may be from North Macedonia but may or may not hold Macedonian nationality (e.g. Albanians, residents who aren't citizens)
* '''North Korea model''': 'Demonym(s): North Macedonian, Macedonian', 'North Macedonian politician', 'North Korean football player' etc. - Minimises confusion and also closely matches double-barreled nationality under Prespa Agreement 'Macedonian/citizen of North Macedonia'
* '''Macedonian only''' - Match self-identified nationality of most citizens of North Macedonian while staying true to the fact that the Prespa Agreement never mentions the term 'North Macedonian'
* '''Macedonian for now, wait for consensus''' - Keep Macedonian for now as it was the demonym under the previous name and wait to see what language sources use going forward

My own quick review of news sources since the name change (12th February) has revealed:

* '''North Korea model''': My personal vote if for Demonym(s): North Macedonian, Macedonian and North Macedonian everywhere else. No other country with a double name (North Korea, South Africa etc.) has a demonym that doesn't match its name. I believe Macedonian as a demonym for someone from North Macedonia is unnecessarily confusing, particularly since there is an ethnicity and three overlapping regions with the same name. Further, Macedonian is not that country's nationality (the nationality is Macedonian/citizen of North Macedonia) and it appears that for Albanian citizens of North Macedonia it will only be 'citizens of North Macedonia' <ref>https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Macedonia/North-Macedonia-the-new-name-comes-with-hopes-and-high-costs-192098</ref>, meaning 'Macedonian' will be an inaccurate designation for them. Finally, it looks like the adjectival reference for the country will most likely be North Macedonian, in which case you will create an enormous number of confusing grey areas and inconsistencies if the demonym is different (North Macedonian government but Macedonian government officials, North Macedonian film but Macedonian filmmakers, North Macedonian population but population of Macedonians etc.) <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Kkyriakop|Kkyriakop]] ([[User talk:Kkyriakop#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kkyriakop|contribs]]) 2019-02-14T02:01:43 (UTC)</small> <small>— [[User:Kkyriakop|Kkyriakop]] ([[User talk:Kkyriakop|talk]]&#32;• [[Special:Contributions/Kkyriakop|contribs]]) has made [[Wikipedia:Single-purpose account|few or no other edits]] outside this topic. </small> [[User:Matthew hk|Matthew hk]] ([[User talk:Matthew hk|talk]]) 05:59, 14 February 2019 (UTC)}}

Right now, the article purports to refer to the culture of ethnic Macedonians ("Macedonian culture is the culture of the ethnic Macedonian population") and is thus appropriately titled 'Macedonian culture'. However, all the subsections refer to the culture of the country of North Macedonia (Music of North Macedonia, Cinema of North Macedonia etc.) and include many references to things like Islamic architecture and the Manaki brothers (who were Aromanians), which pertain to the country but nor the ethnic group.

On the other hand, there is no reference to anything related to ethnic Macedonians outside of North Macedonia, nor in my view should there be, since this would be covered by articles like [[Macedonian diaspora]] and [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia]].

This is consistent with the practice in other similar articles ([[Culture of Greece]], [[Culture of Montenegro]], [[Culture of Bosnia Herzegovina]] etc.) which all refer to countries and not ethnic groups.  

I, therefore, suggest changing the title to 'Culture of North Macedonia' and adjusting the first sentence accordingly.

*I've undone the "<nowiki>{{criticism section}} {{cherry-picked}} {{POV}}</nowiki>" tags because it is not clear to me what the problem is. The IP's edit summary adding them read: "The previous version was mostly examples, this version is mostly criticism from one source, cited multiple times. This seems to violate NPOV." I can't follow this. A scholarly analysis of how process crimes are used by prosecutors isn't necessarily "criticism"; the author we cite doesn't say that it is necessarily wrong to punish criminals by charging them with easier-to-prove process crimes rather than their substantive crimes. I've clarified that by removing the "criticism" from the section header, which somebody else added. Also, the tag's statement that he article is based on "quotations that were previously collated by an advocacy or lobbying group" is mistaken; the article is based on a peer-reviewed law review article. I do agree, though, that the article could benefit from more sources and a perspective that is broader than that of one author; I'll try and find more when I have the time. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User:Sandstein|<span style="color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;">''' Sandstein '''</span>]]</span></small> 08:26, 14 February 2019 (UTC)}}

I think his behavior is unappropriate and based just on personal opinion. How does he define what parts of information are "absolutely absurd and irrelevant"? That sounds absolutely subjective and high-handed.
For example, why would a harness racing track be too unimportant to be included but a golf course not? That doesn't make any sense. The other removals are as senseless like this. Pages linked by him ([[WP:INDISCRIMINATE]], [[WP:TRIVIA]]) don't give any further explanation to his removals. It is like Reywas92 removed only the parts about the topics he knows nothing about or he doesn't personally particularly like.

I left a comment about this on talk page, but he removed also that without any explanation. Obviously he is so omnipotent he doesn't need to take other's point of views even into consideration and only his opinions matters, no matter how subjective they are.

Should we describe Abrams as a "war criminal", and where in the article should we do so?

The previous version of the article stated <blockquote>Elliott Abrams (born January 24, 1948) is an American diplomat, lawyer, political scientist, and war criminal[2] who served in foreign policy positions for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.</blockquote> 

Calling Elliot Abrams a war criminal based on a very contentious statement made in a [[WP:BIASED]] source<blockquote> Alterman, Eric. "An Actual American War Criminal May Become Our Second-Ranking Diplomat". BillMoyers.com. Public Square Media. Retrieved 13 February 2019. </blockquote>without first seeking consensus on the change violates [[WP:BLP]] and [[WP:DUE]].  

I reverted the article to the previous page as required by [[WP:BLP]] while I researched available sources, to make sure Mr. Abrams had or had not been found guilty in a court of a war crime.  The evidence for such a finding may exist, but Abrams has never been found guilty in a court of law of a war crime according to any reliable source of which I am aware. Under [[WP:BLP]] we cannot call Mr. Abrams a "war criminal" unless a court has found him guilty of a war crime.

"Accused war criminal" might be an accurate description of Elliott Abrams.  However, mentioning those accusations in the first paragraph of the lede sentence is [[WP:UNDUE]] until the charges made are adjudicated in a court of law.  So far, Elliot Abrams has not been indicted for war crimes in any court.

I propose we cite Eric Alterman's article [https://www.thenation.com/article/an-actual-american-war-criminal-may-become-our-second-ranking-diplomat/ "An Actual American War Criminal May Become Our Second-Ranking Diplomat"], February 2, 2017, in ''[[The Nation]]'' as support for the statement "Elliott Abrams has been accused of war crimes committed while he served in foreign policy positions for Presidents Ronald Reagan". 

This statement should '''not''' appear in the lede paragraph, because it is the opinion of activists such as Eric Alterman.  So far all of the statements which appear in a Google search "Elliott Abrams war crime" which support Alterman's statements regarding Abrams' guilt of war crimes are activist forums, not reliable secondary sources.  Even Alterman's own statements appear in [[WP:BIASED]] fora such as ''The Nation'' (this article was cited in billmoyers.com, which admitted the article first appeared in ''The Nation'').

[[WP:DUE]] states <blockquote>"Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represents all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources, in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint in the published, reliable sources. Giving due weight and avoiding giving undue weight means that articles should not give minority views or aspects as much of or as detailed a description as more widely held views or widely supported aspects."</blockquote>

I propose this article should be moved. Obvious candidates include:
* MMR-autism hoax
* MMR-autism fraud
* MMR vaccine and autism

Rationale: Scientifically, there is no controversy, and essentially there never was. Virtually all research from the time of the original fraudulent Lancet paper either failed to confirm its findings, or contradicted it. To describe this as a controversy is to give undue weight to the fraud and those who perpetuate it still. The statement in the lede that it is perhaps the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years is pretty compelling evidence that we should choose a less [[WP:WEASEL|musteloid title]]. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 14:41, 20 January 2019 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The text about Lady Gaga was added on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BarlowGirl&oldid=781496448 May 21, 2017] and while Walter and company did not support this change, they did not revert it either. It is only in the recent few days that the text was contested and entirely removed, without any explanation. I did [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BarlowGirl&oldid=879412800 restore an edited version just now], removing the prose, but I expect Walter and company to pounce on it and remove the mention entirely. The text, per my latest revision, is referenced and states the following:
: The [[set list]] for the [[BarlowGirl and Superchick live tour]] in 2009 included a portion of "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" by [[Lady Gaga]], as covered by Superchick. In 2016 and 2017, Lauren Barlow commented favorably on Lady Gaga's performances.
I believe that the text is justified because it is important information, as not many people are expecting BarlowGirl to endorse Lady Gaga. For example, the [[American Family Association]] Journal [https://afajournal.org/past-issues/2004/november-december/barlowgirl-stuffs-stockings-with-spiritual-values/ interviewed BarlowGirl] in November/December 2004. AFA is a group that openly opposes homosexuality, among other values, so it's reasonable to believe that an artist being on good terms with AFA would share the organization's values. It's not just AFA, but also Billy Graham, Joyce Meyer, Secret Keeper Girl, The Revolution TV and several other like-minded ministries. Gaga is famous/infamous for her immodesty, sacrilegious songs like "[[Judas (Lady Gaga song)|Judas]]", the "Born This Way" movement, promoting promiscuity, and many other such values which BarlowGirl's platform historically opposed. If anyone does not realize the problem, I believe they are deceived.

Given this, I am having an RfC to determine whether or not the text should be present. I will allow Walter and company to fill in the "No, we should not add this" section. Thank you for your consideration. --[[User:LABcrabs|LABcrabs]] ([[User talk:LABcrabs|talk]]) 02:50, 21 January 2019 (UTC)}}

Replace with this:

:*[[Bovver boot]]: <code><nowiki>{{cite news | url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-61177939 | title=Max hangs up his boots with £200m | work=[[The People]] | url-access=subscription | via = [[Questia Online Library]] | date=March 31, 1996 | accessdate=March 4, 2013 | author=Gunn, Cathy}}</nowiki></code>

As background, this template was created before CS1/2 had a {{para|url-access}} feature. It also makes other tools like Citation bot difficult as it's not always clear which citation is being tagged with which {{tld|subscription required}} template. 

The RfC will 1) change the documentation to be only for use in free-form citations 2) and for a bot to make the conversions of existing cases to the CS1/2 system (like in the example). Estimate is about 12k-15k cases. -- [[User:GreenC|<span style="color: #006A4E;">'''Green'''</span>]][[User talk:GreenC|<span style="color: #093;">'''C'''</span>]] 22:28, 22 January 2019 (UTC)}}

Right now, {{noping|Citation bot}} removes publisher and location in {{tl|cite journal}}. Proponents of this removal state that this is recommended by nearly every style guide under the belief that there is little value to the information. 

However:

* Several recent threads at [[User talk:Citation bot]] indicate that removing the parameters is unexpected at-best and believed to be detrimental at worst;
* "nearly every style guide" is not [[WP:MOS|our style guide]]
* Removing them does not respect the consensus in [[Module:Citation/CS1]], which is to provide the parameters in cite journal.

This RFC seeks [[WP:CCC|consensus]] for the following questions:

# Should Citation bot continue to remove these data?
# Is there consensus for this removal, {{em|anywhere}}, by {{em|anyone}}?
# Should we continue to support these parameters in [[Module:Citation/CS1]] for {{tl|cite journal}}? <s>If we continue to support these parameters, should we:</s>
## <s>Support them only in metadata without display;</s>
## <s>Display them only without support in the metadata;</s>

, a no-consensus close would also result in stopping the automatic removal.</small> Accordingly, {{ping|Smith609|p=}} is requested to disable the bot until the code is updated and compliant with the results of this RfC. Since they have not edited in almost 2 weeks, I will leave a note at [[WP:ANI]] asking that the bot be blocked until it is updated to be compliant with the result of this RfC.

2. Is there consensus for this removal, anywhere, by anyone?
:This question is a bit trickier. The discussion relating to question 1 discussed the benefits and drawbacks of having the parameters included, and the consensus was that the parameters should not be automatically removed. Thus, there is '''consensus against''' the indiscriminate removal of these parameters in the manner of a [[WP:MEATBOT]]. However, there is consensus that '''these parameters can be removed''' in the same way as any other edit is made (respecting [[WP:BRD|the BRD process]], discussing on the talk page, etc.); likewise, they '''can also be included''' in the same manner.

3. Should we continue to support these parameters in Module:Citation/CS1 for {{tl|cite journal}}?
:There was less discussion about this question. But, given that there is consensus against indiscriminately removing these parameters (see questions #1 and #2), it would make no sense to remove the support for the parameters. Accordingly, we '''should continue to support''' the parameters for {{tl|cite journal}}.

This was a complicated topic; if anyone has any questions about this close feel free to [[User talk:DannyS712|ask me]]. I will leave notes on the maintainer's talk page, as well as at [[WP:ANI]] and [[WP:BOTN]], regarding this close.

{{rfcquote|text=
This RfC is about how [[electric smoking device|products that heat solid tobacco using external heat sources]] work, and how to explain it clearly and comprehensibly (''note these are '''not''' e-cigarettes; they heat tobacco, usually to much higher temperatures'').

Points on which comment is requested:
# Should [[char]]red tobacco be described as unburned?
# Should the more specific term "charred" be preferred to the more general term "heated" for things that have been heated until they charred (charring/pyrolysis cannot occur without heating)?
# Should the more specific term "smoke" be preferred to the more general term "[[aerosol]]" for the emissions of charring tobacco (but not for aerosols heated to temperatures too low to char)? 
# Should Wikipedia have separate articles for products that char tobacco and those that leach it at sub-boiling temperatures (the article currently addresses only charring products)?
# How should the term "burned" be used? Does it encompass both charring and complete combustion to ash?
# Under what circumstances should terminology used to market these products be used in Wikipedia's voice (separate from sourced content on public discussion of such terms)?
# Should the more specific term "charring" be preferred to the more general term "pyrolysis" for pyrolizing complex organic materials, specifically tobacco? (added question)

For those who like pictures, [https://a1.vaping360.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IQOS-34.jpg here] is a photo of one of these products, disassembled after use to show the heat-altered tobacco; and I've put together a [[User:HLHJ/Thermal breakdown of organic matter|pictoral guide]] to the thermal changes in heated organic matter (not neutral on the above questions, but attempting accuracy).

A sourcing error crept in since May 28, 2008, in the following part:
: 3.  Biblical criticism and criticism of the Bible; 3.3 Manuscripts: 
:: "Manuscripts also differ. Usually the differences are minor—matters of spelling and the like—but occasionally they are significant, as in the case of the [[Comma Johanneum]], a clause in the [[First Epistle of John]] that bears explicit witness to the doctrine of the Christian [[Trinity]], <u>but is not found in any manuscript earlier than the 10th century (codex 221), where it is shown as a marginal note</u>.<nowiki><ref name=DBWallace>Daniel B. Wallace,"[http://www.bible.org/page.asp?page_id=1185 The Comma Johanneum and Cyprian]".</ref></nowiki>"
The underlined statement is not found in the mentioned reference, which can still be accessed. Could it be that the source was revised since its publication on June 25, 2004? These are the issues:
* "any manuscript earlier than the 10th century" contradicts the source which stated that "The earliest instance of the passage being quoted as a part of the actual text of the Epistle [italics added] is in a fourth century Latin treatise entitled Liber Apologeticus (chap. 4)..."
* "codex 221" is not found in the source.
The proposed change to match the source could be:
:: "...as in the case of the [[Comma Johanneum]], a clause in the [[First Epistle of John]] that bears explicit witness to the doctrine of the Christian [[Trinity]], <u>which is found written only in Latin in the 4th century at the earliest, but is not observed in any Greek manuscripts prior to 1215</u>.<nowiki><ref name=DBWallace>Daniel B.

{{rfcquote|text=
The article's existing lede stated as follows:
{{quote frame|1='''FC Cincinnati''' is a [[association football|soccer]] club based in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], that will begin play in [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) in 2019. {{highlight| The team will succeed the [[FC Cincinnati (2016–18)|lower-division team]] of the same name and was announced on May 29, 2018, when MLS awarded an expansion franchise to Cincinnati.}}[S] The club's ownership group is led by [[Carl H. Lindner III]].}}
I am proposing RfC, following a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=FC_Cincinnati&diff=880978985&oldid=880978728 dissenting revert] stating "''Not the agreed-upon lede. Seek [[WP:CONSENSUS]] to change it.''";  My proposal is akin to: 
{{quote frame|1='''FC Cincinnati''' is a [[association football|soccer]] club based in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], that will begin play in [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) in 2019. {{highlight| The club began in 2015 and [[FC Cincinnati (2016–18)|played in]] the [[USL Championship|United States Soccer League]] (USL), the second-tier division of the [[United States soccer pyramid]], for two seasons from 2016 to 2018. On May 29, 2018, MLS announced it had awarded the club a franchise in its league.}}[S] The club's ownership group is led by [[Carl H. Lindner III]].}}
My reasoning is: the club is a pre-existing club that has "join[ed] MLS". It previously competed in the USL and was founded in 2015. It is not a new club "of the same name" succeeding the previous one. This is [http://www.espn.in/football/major-league-soccer/story/3512103/fc-cincinnati-to-join-mls-as-expansion-team-next-season based on] the [S]ource cited in the lede itself, which states:
{{quote frame|1=
- MLS made the announcement on Tuesday evening at a ceremony with commissioner Don Garber and Cincinnati mayor John Cranley in attendance. <br> 
- "We congratulate [FC Cincinnati managing owner and CEO] Carl Lindner and his partners, and also the soccer fans of Cincinnati, who '''have passionately supported FC Cincinnati in the USL'''." <br> 
- '''FC Cincinnati, which {{highlight|has played}} in the lower-division United Soccer League {{highlight|since 2016, will continue}} to''' use the University of Cincinnati's Nippert Stadium until its own soccer-specific venue is completed. <br> 
- "I have to start by '''thanking the supporters of FC Cincinnati, because {{highlight| from the beginning they were the foundation of the efforts of our bid to join MLS.}}''' We could not have done this without them. This has been a true team effort among the soccer fans, our partners and our civic and corporate leaders. <br> 
- '''{{highlight|The}} club {{highlight| has been}} a major success story since joining the USL in 2016,''' averaging more than 21,000 fans in 16 home games last season, and beating two MLS clubs in the U.S. Open Cup in front of 30,000-plus fans.}}

Blocks placed for this reason will typically remain in place until the blocked editor can demonstrate that they no longer hold the viewpoint that led to their block.}}

{{rfcquote|text=
As seen at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cultural impact of Michael Jackson]], whether or not there should be a Cultural impact of Michael Jackson article has been subject to debate. That AfD closed as "no consensus." That was in August 2017. In December 2017, further discussion took place at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Music]] (see [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Music/Archive 37#Redirect discussion|here]]). After that, there was a 2018 discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cultural_impact_of_Michael_Jackson&oldid=823153914 on the talk page]. Soon, the article was redirected per arguments made at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Music. Recently, another discussion has taken place on the matter...this time at [[Talk:Michael Jackson]] (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Michael_Jackson&oldid=881408140#Cultural_impact_of_Michael_Jackson here]). So that is where this RfC comes in. One view is that this is a [[WP:No page]] case and that the article (the latest version seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cultural_impact_of_Michael_Jackson&oldid=881375297 here]) is an unnecessary [[WP:Content fork|content fork]] (and the same goes for [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Jackson_in_popular_culture&oldid=881303695 a Michael Jackson in popular culture article]) because it's copy and pasted content already covered at the [[Michael Jackson]] article and related articles. When redirected, the page points to the "[[Michael Jackson#Legacy and influence|Legacy and influence]]" section of the Michael Jackson article. With regard to previous incarnations of the article, there have also been [[WP:Synthesis]] and [[WP:FANPAGE]] concerns. The other view is that the page should be an article because Jackson has had a huge cultural impact. Editors have also felt that since the [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley]], [[Elvis impersonator]], [[Michael Jackson impersonator]] and [[Cultural impact of Madonna]] articles exist, this page should be an article as well. Additionally, editors have talked about fixing up the page so that its existence as an article is justified. 

Thoughts? I will alert the associated WikiProjects to this RfC. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 11:36, 2 February 2019 (UTC)}}

The specific issue is with the factual claim made by the section title itself and the first sentence of the section titled "U.S. as largest beneficiary", both of which clearly breaks this articles policies of 'no original research' and 'verifiability" .

There are eight articles titled like this one, except for digit ([[Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 2|2]], [[Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 3|3]], [[Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 4|4]], [[Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 5|5]], [[Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 6|6]], [[Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 7|7]], [[Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 8|8]], or [[Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 9|9]]).  All are a modest paragraph long, and are such that what is said is likely all that will ever be said.  (You're asking, or looking for dam #1?  No, I didn't forget it.  And none of these articles mentions what happened to it.  Ha! Ha! If all of the dams were listed in one article, I'd add a paragraph on what happened to it; right now, there's no place).  I propose merging them into one article.  The title could be "Allegheny River locks and dams" or "List of locks and dams of the Allegheny River" (similar to [[List of locks and dams of the Ohio River]]).  My experience has been that editors readily or heedlessly split articles, but get contentious about merging them. . These aren't the only dams on the Allegheny, and the proposed merged article could also enumerate those.  It'd make a decent length article.

This merge won't lose any information from the encyclopedia.  It may make information more accessible, since someone looking for one of these will likely have to page back and forth between articles to locate the relevant one.  Especially on a mobile device that only displays one page at a time, that can be very tedious, and load/reload time expensive in elapsed time and data usage.

I would like ideas about the length and depth of this article.

This list was nominated for deletion, the outcone was "keep". I was one of the keep votes. Most everyone who wanted to keep the list commented that it wasn't in any way useful (not as an AfD argument), especially since there were virtually no locations. I have been editing the list and [[User:Aurornisxui/subpage|here]] is what I'm doing (Karlahamn Municipality (the first) is what I have decided on). But the list is massive. I would like some ideas about criteria I might use with the list to winnow out some of the entries. I have searched for other lists of churches, and, as far as I can find, there is no all-encomapssing list of all churches for an entire country. I have already limited the list somewhat by only using Church of Sweden churches. I don't know if I should include cathedrals, chapels, and ruins. I was thinking of making the list only churches recognized by the Swedish National Heritage Board, but that isn't so helpful as they look like they list nearly every church and they list churches from before 1940.

[[User:Jim7049]] insists that an allegation of American involvement belongs in the infobox. This is a clear violation of [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Infoboxes]]: ''When considering any aspect of infobox design, keep in mind the purpose of an infobox: '''to summarize (and not supplant) key facts that appear in the article''' (an article should remain complete with its summary infobox ignored). '''The less information it contains, the more effectively it serves that purpose''', allowing readers to identify key facts at a glance. Of necessity, some infoboxes contain more than just a few fields; however, wherever possible, present information in short form, and '''exclude any unnecessary content'''. Avoid links to sections within the article; the table of contents provides that function.''

* RFC Text:

This RfC was previously opened for only a few days. It has been reopened for more opinions and a proper close. One view is that the article should be structured so that it has a dedicated section for the child sexual abuse allegations against Jackson. As seen at [[Talk:Michael Jackson#Top level section on allegations of and charges for sexual abuse/crimes?]], this was in the light of the ''[[Leaving Neverland]]'' documentary. It was felt that the ''Leaving Neverland'' material was buried in the article in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Jackson&oldid=886956692 this] version, where it was located in the Aftermath section. It was felt that having the ''Leaving Neverland'' material covered with the other child sexual abuse material makes the material more accessible for readers. The other view is that, as noted at [[WP:Criticism]]], controversy or criticism sections can lend undue weight to a matter or draw too much negative attention to a section and therefore result in more POV editing. It was felt that, like WP:Criticism states, "The article should be divided into sections based on topics, timeline, or theme – not viewpoint. Negative criticism should be interwoven throughout the topical or thematic sections." This style is reflected in a number of [[WP:Featured]] biographies. And it was suggested that adding a heading to the ''Leaving Neverland'' material would resolve the issue of editors not easily finding the ''Leaving Neverland'' content, and that restructuring the article for the ''Leaving Neverland'' content is or may be [[WP:Recentism]].

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
Right now, the article purports to refer to the culture of ethnic Macedonians ("Macedonian culture is the culture of the ethnic Macedonian population") and is thus appropriately titled 'Macedonian culture'. However, all the subsections refer to the culture of the country of North Macedonia (Music of North Macedonia, Cinema of North Macedonia etc.) and include many references to things like Islamic architecture and the Manaki brothers (who were Aromanians), which pertain to the country but nor the ethnic group.

On the other hand, there is no reference to anything related to ethnic Macedonians outside of North Macedonia, nor in my view should there be, since this would be covered by articles like [[Macedonian diaspora]] and [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia]].

This is consistent with the practice in other similar articles ([[Culture of Greece]], [[Culture of Montenegro]], [[Culture of Bosnia Herzegovina]] etc.) which all refer to countries and not ethnic groups.  

I, therefore, suggest changing the title to 'Culture of North Macedonia' and adjusting the first sentence accordingly.


: Please start an RfC here if you want to change the long-standing scope of the article. We are having too many hasty, rushed-through changes of too many articles at once in this topic area today.

{{rfcquote|text=
The entire article contains redundancy, unclear meaning, no/improper citations and contains unattributed claims that are are false or misleading.


Key points:

- How does a hard and flexible weapon benefit against armor?

- "most sought after weapon"

- Implies the difficult and long process makes the swords "powerful", not specific portions of the process

- mentions having material properties of both hard and soft steel, but not what they are

- "absolute best"

- "Damascus and Tamahagane steels were created in hopes of being better than Toledo steel, but that was not the case" As far as I'm aware those steels were created independently, not with the intent of recreating/surpassing another like Bulat steel made by Anosov was.

- "Damascus steel was not at all flexible" It was historically believed to be very flexible.

Overall reads like a middle schooler's essay, and may need to be rewritten.

Currently [[WP:G5|G5]] is actionable for articles created by editors violating a block or ban. This is a ''personal'' block or ban: "To qualify, the edit must be a violation of the user's specific block or ban."

Well, an undisclosed paid editor is "banned" from editing, not by Wikipedia policy but by the WMF's Terms of Use. This ban isn't directed at any specific editor, but editing without disclosing payment is blockable.

A discussion on the OTRS mailing list suggests that it would make sense, as an additional deterrent, to treat articles created by such editors as any other G5 article, but the wording of G5 would need to change.

We have the Terms of Use, and we have G5, and the purpose of G5 seems like a good fit for enforcing the Terms of Use ban on undisclosed paid editing.

I suggest adding after the bullet list in G5:
:"In addition, because undisclosed paid editing is prohibited by Wikimedia Foundation policy, articles created by undisclosed paid editors are candidates for speedy deletion under G5."
Or an alternative suggested by Cryptic below:
:"In addition, because undisclosed paid editing is prohibited by Wikimedia Foundation policy, articles created by editors who have been indef-blocked for undisclosed paid editing are candidates for speedy deletion under G5."

On 21 February 2019, the WMF informed various Wikimedia projects of [[:mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|the 2019 talk pages consultation]].

{{quote|The '''Talk pages consultation''' is a global consultation planned from February to June 2019, to bring Wikimedians and wiki-minded people together to define better tools for wiki communication. The consultation will seek input from as many different parts of the Wikimedia community as possible – on multiple projects, in multiple languages, and with multiple perspectives – to come up with a product direction for a set of communication features that a product team will be able to work on in the coming fiscal year.|[[:mw:Talk pages consultation 2019]]}}

An explicit objective of the consultation is to change communication on Wikimedia projects in some way, because the present wikitext communication system [[:mw:Talk pages consultation 2019#Purpose of the consultation|effectively forms a cultural barrier for new contributors, in spite of its flexibility and transparency]]. In enumerating various possible outcomes and solutions, the consultation page [[:mw:Talk pages consultation 2019#Possible solutions|notes]]: "For this process to work, we need to be open to all kinds of directions."

In this stage of the consultation, the WMF [[:mw:Talk pages consultation 2019#Phase 1: Collect information|suggests asking community members five questions]]. There are therefore five subsections for each of those questions (under [[#Suggested questions|§ Suggested questions]]). It may also be appropriate for other issues to be considered on this page, in separate subsections (under [[#Other topics|§ Other topics]]).

I am entering and numbering this proposal in order to get it into the record, but am requesting that action on it be deferred until the current round of MFDs are decided.

As per [[User:UnitedStatesian]], Create [[WP:CSD|Criteria for Speedy Deletion]] criterion X3, for portals created by [[User:The Transhumanist]] between April 2018 and March 2019.  Tagging the portals for speedy deletion will provide the notice to users of the portals, if there are any users of the portals.  I recommend that instructions to administrators include a request to wait 24 hours before deleting a portal.  This is a compromise between the usual 1 to 4 hours for speedy deletion and 7 days for XFD.  The availability of Twinkle for one-click tagging will make it easy to tag the pages, while notifying the users (if there are any).

Hello, I am the writer of [[NGHTCRWLRS]]. It was moved to Nghtcrwlrs and changed at every instance in the article. it has never been printed as such in a source.

If every source (or most) report it as NGHTCRWLRS, it should be reflected here since Wikipedia does not infringe on artistic style, nor allow original research. This is apparent at [[iPod]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[NSYNC]] (supported in its state by [[backronym]]), [[Mötley Crüe]], [[k.d. lang]] and the existence of {{tl|lowercasetitle}}, instead of [[Ipod]], [[Guns n' Roses]], [[Nsync]], [[Motley Crue]], [[K.D.

Currently, [[WP:DYKSG#C6]] reads:
{{quote|C6: If the subject is a work of fiction or a fictional character, the hook must involve the real world in some way.}}

I am proposing that this be modified to read as (changes in italics):
{{quote|C6: If the subject is a work of fiction or a fictional character, the hook ''should ideally'' involve the real world in some way; ''however, in-universe hooks may be permitted on a case-by-case basis if consensus decides that such a hook is the most interesting and/or when the real world information in the article is considered not suitable for a hook. Such hooks must make it clear that the hook content is fictional and should not present facts in an in-universe manner.''}}

An example of a hook that would fit under this proposed change would go like {{tq|... that in the film '''''Movie X''''', Earth is depicted as a cold wasteland that has been taken over by Martians?}}. This will not necessarily mean that we should do away with requiring real world hooks for fictional material, merely that in-universe hooks ''may'' be allowed sometimes. This proposal could also help out with the problem that sometimes reviewers cannot determine if a fact is in-universe or not (for example, in video game hooks, do gameplay mechanics count as in-universe or not?).

A couple other names on the list are pseudonyms of ''some''one, but there is no clear information as to whom these pen names belong, nor have they been verified in any reliable sources. So should the artist/writer section be done away with entirely?</s> '''Should the artist/writer credits be done away with?''' Many of the artists and writers don't seem to pass [[WP:GNG]], and there are multiple instances of pen names -- however, I know of the pen names only through personal contact, and cannot directly verify any pen names without violating [[WP:OR]]. <span style="color:green">'''Ten Pound Hammer'''</span> • <sup>([[User talk:TenPoundHammer|What did I screw up now?]])</sup> 02:12, 10 March 2019 (UTC)}}

One view is that since many or most reliable sources state that Fualaau was 12 at the time, while other sources state that he was 13, we should either go with age 12 or state "12 or 13." This view argues that we should do either per [[WP:Due weight]]. The other view is that going with age 12 is more "titillating" and that we should go with age 13 because it is being "conservative." This argument is made per [[WP:BLP]] stating that "Biographies of living persons ('BLPs') must be written conservatively and with regard for the subject's privacy." A counterargument regarding the interpretation of "conservative" was also made.

As mentioned above, just in terms of pure word count, the coverage of this single incident makes up over 53% of the article length. The potential split of this [[WP:EVENT|event]] into a separate article was discussed in a previous RfC (above) and should therefore require consensus in a new RfC to come to a different decision. Since March 1st, this subsection of the article has grown by 56%. All the same arguments apply: the event meets [[WP:GNG]], [[WP:SUMMARY]] and [[WP:EVENT]]. Those who !voted some variation of "wait to split," have you changed your minds now that it has grown to overshadow most of the rest of the article content?

{{rfcquote|text=
The source says "prostatitis [is] more accurately diagnosed [as] pelvic floor dysfunction. This alternative paradigm suggests pelvic pain arises from chronic pelvic floor irritation initiated by anxiety-provoked chronic muscular guarding of the pelvic floor leading to pelvic floor hypertonicity. This behavioral complex perpetuates a self-feeding cycle of pelvic tissue irritation, tension, pain, and anxiety."

;Proposal 1
One proposal is that CP/CPPS is a [[psychological]] as well as a [[neuromuscular disorder]].<ref name=And2018/> The suggestion is that anxiety results in long term contraction of the pelvic floor muscles which results in pain.<ref name=And2018/> The pain results in further anxiety and thus worsening of the condition.<ref name=And2018/>

;Proposal 2
One theory is that CPPS is caused by chronic tension in the pelvic floor musculature. Long-term contraction of the pelvic floor muscles results in tissue irritation, spasm, damage, and pain. This chronic tension of the pelvic floor muscles is often the result of muscular guarding, caused by anxiety. It can become a self-reinforcing cycle, whereby pain and anxiety caused by the condition can cause further pelvic floor muscle tension, thereby worsening the condition.

I haven't posted here in nearly three years. I hoped to never do so again. But with my 2015 reforms now front and center, we need to settle this. Get to the point and have a straight up-or-down RfC on bureaucrat discretion.

'''Question''': ''Should the discretion of bureaucrats in Requests for Adminship be absolutely confined to the range between 65% and 75% (inclusive) raw support, with no exceptions and, for this sole purpose, notwithstanding any other Wikipedia principle, policy and/or guideline that might be interpreted as permitting otherwise?''  

If your answer to the above is "yes," support. If your answer is "no," oppose.

For supporters, also specify whether rounding is acceptable. Does anything from 64.50% to 64.99%, or anything from 75.01% to 75.49%, fall within the discretionary range?

Whether on not the Crats have discretion outside the 65%-75% discretionary zone, there are various things that have been posited as factors that crats should or should not take into account when weighing RFA consensus. Some of these may not have been discussed by the community for some time, by discussing them individually hopefully we can reaffirm or end consensus as to which of these considerations are reasonable for the crats to focus on in crat chats. 

'''Question''': ''Should the discretion of bureaucrats in Requests for Adminship include giving a little extra benefit of the doubt for very long established members of the community? (In practice this would mean that an RFA candidate who had been here for over ten years would, all other things being equal, be more likely to pass RFA at 65% than someone who had only been here five or six years)?

If your answer to the above is "yes," support. If your answer is "no," oppose.

Currently, I think our coverage of the various formats referred to as "35mm" is a mess. We have four articles:
* [[35 mm film]], on the movie film
* [[135 film]], on the still photographic film
* [[35mm format]], on the 36×24 mm size in still photographic film or digital photography
* [[Full frame]], on a particular gate size of the movie film

I think it is safe to say that the topic of each article is [[WP:PRECISE|not readily apparent from its title]]. There are several issues I'd like to address:
# Do we really need four articles? I'm open to any solutions, such as merging existing articles, moving things around, creating new overview articles or disambiguation pages, etc.
# Is there a less confusing way to title the articles? If you google "35mm film" or "35 mm film", almost all of the top results discuss the still photographic film, suggesting to me that the movie film is not the [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]] for this term. Likewise, "Full frame" should probably be turned into a disambiguation page based on a cursory Google search.
# We have one article called "35 mm film", and another called "35mm format". Should there be a space between "35" and "mm"?

The [[Template:Infobox officeholder/doc|current policy]] regarding ordinal numbering is that an infobox should only mention someone is the ''n''th President, Prime-Minister, senator, etc. if this is well established practice in the country the person holds office in. Recently, [[User:CroGamer 1|CroGamer 1]] has called for this policy to change. The problem lies in the fact that ordinal numbering is subjective; if someone is elected non-consecutively, how does the numbering works? What about a temporarily acting officeholder? At the same time, knowing that someone was the "11th President of X" can be useful to know. If there is a well established usage in the relevant country, we should still follow that. If this isn't the case, should we continue our policy of not mentioning it, or should we have a wiki-wide policy for all these countries in which we establish how to number? 23:09, 17 March 2019 (UTC)}}

Seeking fresh, outside, neutral opinions on the "Occurrence" section's sources, per the Medref tag, please. Previous discussion is at [[Talk:Detransition#Medref_tag]]. Please note this page is tagged "Controversial". 

The Medref tag was added 2017 December 27, 15 months ago. At that time, the article overall had 16 sources, all from the news. The medical section referenced 5 of those news sources, 2 of which referred to the same story.

Today, the article has 61 sources: 5 from books, 13 from medical journals, 32 of which are from news, and 11 from online sources. The medical section references 26 of those sources: 2 from books, 11 from journals, 15 from news, 1 from general online. Of the 11 journal sources, 2 of them reference the other 9.

{{rfcquote|text=
Page movers and administrators have the ability to [[WP:MOR|move pages over redirects]].  However, they can only perform this operation if the redirect ''has no other edits to it except its creation''.  This is with good reason, because it prevents abuse e.g. a page mover or administrator could [[WP:BLAR|blank and redirect]] a really important page and then move another page over it, thus deleting it.

I am proposing a change to how the system works.  [[Special:Diff/888467529|This]] is the latest example of many requested moves I have closed, hoping to move over a redirect, only to find that a bot, usually [[User:RussBot]] or [[User:Avicbot]], have made one minor edit to it, such as fixing a double redirect.  These edits are marked as minor, however, it still means that a [[WP:ROUNDROBIN|round robin]] move is required, which not only makes the page history look more confusing to the untrained eye, but also uses up more moves than is really necessary.  The anti-abuse measure would still work because pages with any history whatsoever could not be blanked and deleted in an abusive way due to the "all minor" restriction.

Therefore, I propose '''that the MediaWiki [[WP:MOR|move over redirect]] function be changed to allow users with +extendedmover to move over a redirect only if the redirect, or its talk page, has no edits which are not marked as minor in its page history, apart from its creation.'''

Recently the [[WP:ITN]] nomination of [[2019 Xiangshui chemical plant explosion]] made me realize that we don't have a consistent style for [[administrative divisions of China]]. Here's the full example:
<blockquote>
On 21 March 2019, a major explosion occurred at a chemical plant in [[:zh:陈家港镇|Chenjiagang (Town)]], [[Xiangshui County|Xiangshui (County)]], [[Yancheng]], [[Jiangsu|Jiangsu (Province)]], [[China]].
</blockquote>
Each of these parentheses represents an optional descriptor which can be seen in many English-language sources about China. (I have omitted the [[prefecture-level city|city]] level as it is very uncommon to append "city" or "prefecture" to the end of these.) For each level in question ([[Towns of China|town]], [[Counties of China|county]], [[Provinces of China|province]]), we want to answer:
# Should the administrative level descriptor be present?
# If so, should it be written in uppercase (Chenjiagang Town) or lowercase (Chenjiagang town)?

I believe the line stating “He is presently under a four-month suspension from the practice of law after a finding of misconduct. [7]” should be removed from the first paragraph along with the removal of the line “It was announced on April 2, 2019 that attorney Adam Leitman Bailey will have his law license suspended for a 4 month term. [10] [11]” in the background section. It is rare to have this sort of information in any introductory paragraph for a biographaphical page. For example Linda Addison <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Addison_(lawyer)</ref> or  William F. Aldinger III <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Aldinger_III</ref>, both being former attorneys from New York, only have basic life timeline information in their first paragraphs. It makes sense for this information to be noted in the lawsuit against bailey section, but to have it in 3 separate locations across the page is a bit absurd for such a short biography page noting that the suspension is only for 4 months out of an entire lifetime/career.

Rigel has five stars requiring us to call them something in this article. They had been called Rigel A, Ba, Bb, C and D. However the IAU has ruled that the name "Rigel" applies to the main star, leaving some confusion as to the rest. SIMBAD lists as 'Beta Orionis B' [http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=NAME+Rigel&NbIdent=query_hlinks&Coord=05+14+32.27210-08+12+05.8981&parents=1&siblings=1&submit=siblings&hlinksdisplay=h_all here]. At least two sources use Rigel B,C and D.[http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/rigel.html] [https://books.google.com.au/books?redir_esc=y&id=40JzBYGREL0C&q=Rigel#v=snippet&q=Rigel&f=false]. The IAU at the bottom of page 5 [https://www.iau.org/static/science/scientific_bodies/working_groups/280/wg-starnames-triennial-report-2015-2018.pdf here] says "As these useful nicknames with the form [proper name] [letter component] often appear in the literature, many appear in the SIMBAD database." but notes they are unofficial. Other names - STF 688B for Rigel B, and BU 555Ba, BU555Bb, BC 555C and BU 555 D for Rigel Ba, Bb, C and D respectively - are almost never used, and only rarely seen in journals. So we have a choice - Rigel A, Ba, Bb, C and D....Beta Orionis Ba, Bb, C and D...or...what? Can people denote their choices below.

{{rfcquote|text=
Our lists of prehistoric life by US state require a lot of images since most prehistoric life will be unfamiliar to most readers. I've been reformatting the way images are displayed on these articles using multiple image templates hoping to minimize visual clutter and distraction from the main text while maintaining an informative quantity of images. That being said, there are potential drawbacks. On the [[Cenozoic life of Washington state]] [[Talk:List of the Cenozoic life of Washington (state)|talk page]] {{ping|Kevmin}} disagreed with the aforementioned approach, saying: {{blockquote|I see that the images are being grouped into tiny little mutiple image boxes.  I have to say I'm not a fan of the results, which are hard to see images, seemingly large blocks of text, and massive amounts of white space in the list again.  The simple one image per box format filled the article better and made the images much more accessible.}}
Since the recent changes proved controversial, I wanted to raise a discussion about the best way to display images in these articles. I moved the discussion here because this article was already completely redone in the newer style. Examples of previous styles can be found at:

* The [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_the_Mesozoic_life_of_Wyoming&oldid=872526598 original style]
* The [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_the_Mesozoic_life_of_Wyoming&oldid=891636468 previous style] with use of wider 2 or 3 image multiple image templates.
* The [[List of the Mesozoic life of Wyoming|current style]] with heavy use of a narrower-widthed multiple image template.
Any or none of these might provide a good reference point on how to proceed. How do you think we should display images on these articles? [[User:Abyssal|Abyssal]] ([[User talk:Abyssal|talk]]) 19:15, 25 April 2019 (UTC)}}

In the absence of any contradictory secondary source is there any reason why the article titled "Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy" cannot include the following verbatim quotes from secondary sources: (1) According to reports, an anti-abortion group heavily edited the videos to make it appear Planned Parenthood was selling fetal tissue. But on appeal, the Fifth Circuit said that's not what happened.  (2) "The record reflects that [the Texas Office of Inspector General] had submitted a report from a forensic firm concluding that the video was authentic and not deceptively edited," Judith Edith Jones wrote for the appeals panel. (3) Jones said the plaintiffs did not identify any particular omission or addition in the video footage. That was enough to support the decision by health and human service officials. (4) The Fifth Circuit, however, found that Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast has sold tissue for outside research. [[User:Swood100|Swood100]] ([[User talk:Swood100|talk]]) 21:49, 24 April 2019 (UTC)}}

Dear bio friends,

Bear with me for the second question, I am practicing to write wikipedia lead paragraph for bio, and my educational question is: Would it be more appropriate that the lead paragraph start with something like 

: "Martin Luther King. Jr (year-year) is an American civil right leader, minister of..."(slightly changing order of the current version). 

My reason is Civil right leader is what he is mostly known and recognized for. Please educate me why this is better or not than the current version. Thank you!

Questions on inclusion of self published contents and slip streaming things into existing contents. 

I'm still foggy after reading through [[WP:YT]] and [[WP:ELNO]] given a line like. "Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article would contain if it became a featured article". Please see "Voodoo doc film" section in this talk page. Initially, I removed a YouTube video from the article [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voodoo_Doughnut&type=revision&diff=889907193&oldid=888995975 here]. The video was made by three individuals and hosted on one of the individual creators' personal YouTube. The subject of video is about the article's company. Anyone with a camcorder, some skills and editing can call themselves a director. So if someone, or a group of indie directors make a short video about a company, when would it be generally acceptable to be inserted? At the time I removed it, there was no context of why it should have been there. It was restored later which referenced a source that mentioned the video (one line) in an announcement in another city that a location of VooDoo was opening in that city. 
On Wikipedia, it's too common to see something like "notable people such as A, B, C, D, E..." only to see F, G, H and so on getting added onto it. I've even come across people who go and insert certain people/companies as examples into many articles. Since YouTube carries monetizing potential, it's especially a concern that motivates people to find a way to insert something into a high view count articles.

I believe the line stating “He is presently under a four-month suspension from the practice of law after a finding of misconduct.

[10] [11]” in the background section. It is rare to have this sort of information in any introductory paragraph for a biographaphical page. For example Linda Addison <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Addison_(lawyer)</ref> or  William F. Aldinger III <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Aldinger_III</ref>, both being former attorneys from New York, only have basic life timeline information in their first paragraphs. It makes sense for this information to be noted in the lawsuit against bailey section, but to have it in 3 separate locations across the page is a bit absurd for such a short biography page noting that the suspension is only for 4 months out of an entire lifetime/career.

I propose adding the following text to [[Wikipedia:General sanctions#Community sanctions]]:

{{quotation box|1=<s>Administrators can bypass [[Wikipedia:Deletion process|deletion discussion]] and immediately delete Wikipedia pages or media that are within scope of a community general sanction only when the pages or media meet the requirements for [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion]].</s> <u>Administrators cannot delete pages or media within the scope of a community general sanction without a [[Wikipedia:Deletion process|deletion discussion]] unless the pages or media fall under the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|criteria for speedy deletion]].</u> Such deletions are ordinary speedy deletions so have no special restrictions on reversibility and can be appealed at [[Wikipedia:Deletion review|deletion review]].

Hello. I'm hoping to add under section 7.6 (Israeli-Palestinian conflict) details of the recent publication of an anti-semitic cartoon and acknowledgement of such by the NYT editorial board<ref> https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/opinion/cartoon-nytimes.html</ref>. This is the first time NYT has acknowledged the publication of something which in its opinion, contained anti-semitic tropes.
 
This is especially to better counter-balance the statement in source citation 244 that by the NYT public editor Clark Hoyt that the newspaper "has tried its best to do a fair, balanced and complete job — and has largely succeeded".

I also think comment from the cartoonist can be added, in which he contends that there was no anti-semitic intent: <ref>https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Cartoonist-of-NYT-caricature-to-Post-I-have-nothing-against-the-Jews-588291</ref>

I believe the line stating “He is presently under a four-month suspension from the practice of law after a finding of misconduct.

[10] [11]” in the background section. It is rare to have this sort of information in any introductory paragraph for a biographaphical page. For example [[Linda Addison (lawyer)|Linda Addison]] or [[William F. Aldinger III]], both being former attorneys from New York, only have basic life timeline information in their first paragraphs. It makes sense for this information to be noted in the lawsuit against bailey section, but to have it in 3 separate locations across the page is a bit absurd for such a short biography page noting that the suspension is only for 4 months out of an entire lifetime/career.

A request to merge the [[Fair Housing Act]] and [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]] into the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]]. The [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]] and [[Fair Housing Act]] are the core components of this act, excluding Titles I and X.  Both of those articles are start-class.  They also posses overlapping content with this article that would further reduce their size.

I'm trying to restructure the article Civil Rights Act of 1968 (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Civil_Rights_Act_of_1968&diff=prev&oldid=890416891 before]) to better reveal the basic parts of the act. Alot of sections of this article are empty. The empty sections can be filled in with content from those other articles.  Perhaps in the future content for both of those articles would become substantial enough to warrant a separate article.  That future has not currently arrived.

{{rfcquote|text=
The [[Template:Infobox officeholder/doc|current policy]] regarding ordinal numbering is that an infobox should only mention someone is the ''n''th President, Prime-Minister, senator, etc. if this is well established practice in the country the person holds office in. Recently, [[User:CroGamer 1|CroGamer 1]] has called for this policy to change. The problem lies in the fact that ordinal numbering is subjective; if someone is elected non-consecutively, how does the numbering works? What about a temporarily acting officeholder? At the same time, knowing that someone was the "11th President of X" can be useful to know. If there is a well established usage in the relevant country, we should still follow that. If this isn't the case, should we continue our policy of not mentioning it, or should we have a wiki-wide policy for all these countries in which we establish how to number? 23:09, 17 March 2019 (UTC)}}

}</code> (used as <code>{{{input1}}}</code> in {{tl|Citation/identifier}}). 

I could probably use generic <code>{{{id}}}</code>, but I wish there was a way to make it simpler and generate more harmonized formatting. I found {{tl|cite ISO standard}}, which seems very limited, and tried to add something similar to the respective [[Template:Citation/identifier/sandbox|sandbox]] by introducing a new identifier <code>iso</code>.
I would like to see some general advice and automation. 

Standards are reliable sources, of course, but only few are available for free, which makes them less popular references. On the other hand, several standards do have a distinguished Wikipedia article, e.g. [[ISO 9]], or provide a redirect to a more generic description of their topic, e.g. [[Romanization of Cyrillic]]. The following mockup is overly verbose, but it shows metadata that could be used. — [[User:Crissov|Christoph]] [[User talk:Crissov|Päper]] 10:07, 8 May 2019 (UTC)}}

The conflict infobox is intended to provide a brief summary. The question for comment here relates to striking a balance between concision and completeness. Specifically, this RfC is to establish in ''broad terms'' the  belligerents and commanders to be listed and not specific individuals and countries. For background, see the discussion immediately above. The options arising from the discussion are identified as follows:

'''Option 1:''' Maintain the ''status quo'' as represented by [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pacific_War&diff=next&oldid=886416739 this version] or a more recent version that might be agreed upon but is not substantially different.
:*Which particular version best represents the ''status quo'' might emerge from further discussion but is ultimately immaterial (in the first instance) to support for maintaining the ''status quo''. If it is not apparent in the first instance, it might be subsequently clarified once (and if) the ''status quo'' becomes the consensus.

'''Option 2:''' Parse the infobox (particularly the belligerents and the leaders) IAW the example set at [[World War II]].
:*There is no specific example for the Pacific War but, as a broad option, it would likely limit the Allies listed to three or so and the commanders to the principle prime minister/president of each. It would also refer to a more complete list of Allies involved.

'''Option 3:''' Expand entries under the section for "commanders and leaders" - particularly for the Allies.

A question came to the fore whether or not we should add the directional bearings of [[Efrat]] (an Israeli town of nearly 10,000 residents) from Solomon's Pools, so that the lede paragraph will now read as follows:
:'''Solomon's Pools''' ({{lang-ar|برك سليمان}}, ''Burak Suleīmān'', Solomon's Pools, or simply ''el-Burak'', the pools; {{lang-he|בריכות שלמה}}, ''Breichot Shlomo'') are three ancient reservoirs located in the south-central [[West Bank]], immediately to the south of [[al-Khader]], about {{convert|5|km|mi}} southwest of [[Bethlehem]], near the road to [[Hebron]], and north of [[Efrat]].

{{rfcquote|text=
Our lists of prehistoric life by US state require a lot of images since most prehistoric life will be unfamiliar to most readers. I've been reformatting the way images are displayed on these articles using multiple image templates hoping to minimize visual clutter and distraction from the main text while maintaining an informative quantity of images. That being said, there are potential drawbacks. On the [[Cenozoic life of Washington state]] [[Talk:List of the Cenozoic life of Washington (state)|talk page]] {{ping|Kevmin}} disagreed with the aforementioned approach, saying: {{blockquote|I see that the images are being grouped into tiny little mutiple image boxes.  I have to say I'm not a fan of the results, which are hard to see images, seemingly large blocks of text, and massive amounts of white space in the list again.  The simple one image per box format filled the article better and made the images much more accessible.}}
Since the recent changes proved controversial, I wanted to raise a discussion about the best way to display images in these articles. I moved the discussion here because this article was already completely redone in the newer style. Examples of previous styles can be found at:

* The [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_the_Mesozoic_life_of_Wyoming&oldid=872526598 original style]
* The [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_the_Mesozoic_life_of_Wyoming&oldid=891636468 previous style] with use of wider 2 or 3 image multiple image templates.
* The [[List of the Mesozoic life of Wyoming|current style]] with heavy use of a narrower-widthed multiple image template.
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_the_Mesozoic_life_of_Wyoming&oldid=894238684 Another style] with heavy use of a wider multiple image template.

Any or none of these might provide a good reference point on how to proceed. How do you think we should display images on these articles? [[User:Abyssal|Abyssal]] ([[User talk:Abyssal|talk]]) 19:15, 25 April 2019 (UTC)}}

The arbitration policy's section on "[[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Policy#Ratification and amendment|Ratification and amendment]]" says, "Proposed amendments may be submitted for ratification only after being approved by a majority vote of the Committee, or having been requested by a petition signed by at least one hundred editors in good standing."

This is the petition part of the amendment process. The ratification process may be started if and when the petition is signed by at least one hundred editors in good standing.

{{Ivmbox|1=The first paragraph of the "[[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Policy#Policy and precedent|Policy and precedent]]" section of the arbitration policy is amended to add the following underlined text:

Almost every Polish person educated during the communist period is familiar with the song.[3] It is the official anthem of the [[Polish People's Party]].

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TERF&oldid=899683990 This] is the previous lead. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TERF&oldid=900017163 This] is the current lead. A comparison of the leads are in the [[Talk:TERF#Discussion|Discussion]] section.

[[Talk:TERF#The lead and two pieces in the responses section|The dispute]] is about whether or not the second version adheres to [[WP:WIKIVOICE]]. A concern has been expressed that the because the term is controversial, disputed (by both those to whom the term is applied to and by some academics), and is broad (also referring to people who are not feminists, and to views that may not be transphobic or are contested as transphobic), the lead should not use "transphobic" in Wikipedia's voice, at not least without qualifiers such as "considered to be," which are qualifiers used in both the lead of the [[Feminist views on transgender topics]] page and in the "Coinage and usage" of the TERF page. At the moment, the lead presents academics as only being for the side that supports use of the term "TERF." Counterarguments are that the lead is fine as is because views from people called TERFs are usually transphobic. Because a statement such as "trans women are not women" is widely considered transphobic by feminists, we should just state "transphobic" in Wikipedia's voice. Because people referred to as TERFs are a minority, we should present the "transphobic" text as fact. To do otherwise might be sending the message that Wikipedia promotes transphobia. So which incarnation should we use? Or should we use different wording? [[Special:Contributions/98.162.170.103|98.162.170.103]] ([[User talk:98.162.170.103|talk]]) 02:43, 3 June 2019 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Since May 2015, [[User:InternetArchiveBot]], aka IABot, has been continuously working to restore dead URLs by relinking them to archive snapshots.  While IABot primarily links to Wayback Machine URLs, it’s able to handle over 20 different archive services.  To date more than 10 million “broken” links have been repaired.  This has helped a great deal to enforcing and maintaining [[WP:VERIFIABILITY]].

Today, I am proposing a new feature of IABot to add links to referenced books from Archive.org.  IABot will search for books referenced in enwiki articles and link to any it finds available at archive.org.  Book references containing page numbers will link straight to those pages allowing editors and readers to more easily verify the contents of an article referencing the book.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Luther_King_Jr.&diff=892626553&oldid=892625155 Here] is an example of such an edit IABot would be making to an article.

An example of the benefit of this proposal can be seen on this article: [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]  where pages from 54 referenced books are now just a click away from readers.  For example Citation #1.  As can be seen, any book reference with page numbers will make the title and the page numbers link straight to the desired page of the referenced book.  References that have the title wiki-linked elsewhere will only have the page numbers linked.—[[User:Cyberpower678|'''<span style="color:darkgrey;font-family:monospace">CYBERPOWER</span>''']] <span style="font-family:Rockwell">([[User talk:Cyberpower678|<span style="color:olive">Chat</span>]])</span> 17:45, 17 May 2019 (UTC)}}

Hello. I'm hoping to add under section 7.6 (Israeli-Palestinian conflict) details of the recent publication of an anti-semitic cartoon and acknowledgement of such by the NYT editorial board [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/opinion/cartoon-nytimes.html]. This is the first time NYT has acknowledged the publication of something which in its opinion, contained anti-semitic tropes.
 
This is especially to better counter-balance the statement in source citation 244 that by the NYT public editor Clark Hoyt that the newspaper "has tried its best to do a fair, balanced and complete job — and has largely succeeded".

I also think comment from the cartoonist can be added, in which he contends that there was no anti-semitic intent: [https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Cartoonist-of-NYT-caricature-to-Post-I-have-nothing-against-the-Jews-588291]

Request for comment to help with article, which is currently at risk of becoming an edit war. Article is strongly biased and suggests that the individual is a prominent and influential scientist with wide community support. However individual is a fringe pseudoscientist that claims to have conversed with aliens. Supporters are regularly spamming other Wiki pages (see [[Bimetric gravity]] and [[Thibault Damour]] which borders on the defamatory and is completely inaccurate) and removing their valuable content. For example, a recent change to the page includes lots of misleading information: including that there has been a peer-reviewed paper from Petit that has answered critics (in [[Progress in Physics]] which is a crackpot journal), and claimed that various papers (by Bodarenko and others) were speaking positively of Petit's work (which they did not do, they just politely mention it!).

I've edited this page down to a paragraph basically, because the article as it [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Call-out_culture&oldid=894960329 was] contained mostly primary sources - op-eds - and these were mostly authored by people in completely unrelated fields, with no expertise on the subject. I may have missed something, but the page did not read like an encyclopedic entry and the citations were completely inappropriate, across the board. I'd like feedback about sources and the page in general, I personally think the page should be deleted or merged, failing that it should be concise, encyclopedic, accurate and properly cited, not a meandering list of opinion, cited with opinion pieces. Other editors want to reinstate the assertions backed by op-eds, I think these assertions, based on op-eds are opinion 100% POV and should not be published here.

When did same-sex sexual activity decriminalised in the Pitcairn Islands?

The current version citing the 2015 State-Sponsored Homophobia report by ILGA says it was in 2001. However after some research, I found that the laws in force in England are generally apply to the Pitcairn Islands, especially the laws related to sexual offences. [[Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004]] showed that the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]] was applicable to the Pitcairn Islands. The Judicature Ordinance 1961 of the Pitcairn Islands stated that

‘7. Subject to the provisions of section 8 of this Ordinance the substance of the law for the time being in force in and for England shall be in force in the Islands.

8. All of the laws of England extended to the Islands by this Ordinance shall be in force therein so far only us the local circumstances and the limits of local jurisdiction permit and subject to any existing or future Ordinance and for the purpose of facilitating the application of the said laws it shall be lawful to construe the same with such formal alterations not affecting the substance as to names, localities, courts, officers, persons, moneys, penalties and otherwise as may be necessary to render the same applicable to the circumstances.' ([http://www.paclii.org/pn/cases/PNSC/2005/1.html] para 93)

Therefore I think the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]] which decriminalised same-sex sexual activity should also applicable to the Pitcairn Islands.--[[Special:Contributions/42.3.195.74|42.3.195.74]] ([[User talk:42.3.195.74|talk]]) 15:55, 1 June 2019 (UTC)}}

I dispute the previous consensus, because it was ended prematurely by a user. A lot of the reason for the closing were more personal rather then about the image and I find this unfair and both the initial proposed and alternative image I added on there didn't get a chance to be evaluate properly, again, it was mostly personal remarks about the user (me) then the actual photo. I just want to see what others think/decide which of the follow should be used at a unbiased, neutral approach on it. 

Main reason why I oppose the grey image being used is stuff such as the white reflection effect on the windshield and bonnet on the grey car, the blue one has less then that and the headlights aren't fogged up due to where it was taken and are clear and sharp. It also been taken from a weird elevated place while the blue one was photographed at standing height. There also red splodge sources around the grille and bumper which the blue car also doesn't has. The image tilted which I believe was done so it can be promoted to QI, since one of the guidelines for promoting a image to QI is the tilt/perspective should be corrected, even if it means the car isn't at a angle you want it to be. I also believe preferring a image over the other simply because it a QI (the grey car) is irrational due to the several problems I stated above. --[[User:Vauxford|Vauxford]] ([[User talk:Vauxford|talk]]) 13:04, 16 June 2019 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
There is a dispute between points of view on that page. The dispute has grown around the fact that there is already an article – [[Government of the Soviet Union]], therefore there is no need to make an article about one period of the Soviet Government - Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union (1923–1946). I argue that the article is important, because it describes a significant part of the activities of the Government of Leninist and the early Stalinist Soviet Union. This article describes certain features of the Government of the Soviet Union, which were already foreign to the successor, Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union (Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union page was deleted and redirected to the Government of the Soviet Union too, I'm not the creator of that page). In the Russian Wikipedia, there is a separate article for the Council of People's Commissars and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. To not make this an edit war, I hope that Wikipedia community will review that problem and will make a subsequent decision.

{{Anchor| ph2 timetable}}Phase 2 of the [[:mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|2019 talk pages consultation]] began on 17 May 2019 and is tentatively scheduled to end on 15 June 2019.

Feedback from the first phase, which occurred between 21 February 2019 and 6 April 2019, has been evaluated and turned into [[:mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Phase 1 report|a report]]. Based on the first phase's discussions, six main questions are being asked. (The questions, their section headers and the contextual information are quoted verbatim in the subsections below, under [[#Main questions|§ Main questions]].) Anyone may also begin a new discussion of their choice under [[#Other discussions|§ Other discussions]].

In the first phase, the English Wikipedia was registered as a single "participant group"; this is to be the same in Phase 2. About 100 editors participated in [[Wikipedia:Talk pages consultation 2019/Phase 1|the local discussion]], and more than 300 other editors participated elsewhere. In this phase, there is also to be an option to give feedback through a Qualtrics survey (which has not been opened yet); as in the first phase, feedback can also be given [[:mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Individual feedback#Phase 2 questions|on mediawiki.org]] and in discussions on other fora.

As in the first phase, [[#ph2 timetable|at the end of the discussion]], a summary is to be posted to mediawiki.org. [[User:Jc86035|Jc86035]] ([[User talk:Jc86035|talk]]) 14:03, 18 May 2019 (UTC)}}

There are two different allegations in this section, the truth of which cannot be confirmed and apparently she hasn't responded to them. The first one is her alleged reaction to "research by Dorothy Cheney and Robert Seyfarth seemed to indicate that rank among female baboons is hereditary." While some may argue in favor of keeping this one, the second one, which has been made by her daughter's ex-boyfriend could potentially be a lie. He has alleged that while he was dating her daughter he realized that she had named two sheep after Venus and Serena Williams. This is just a rumor made by an attention-seeking person and, in my opinion, has no basis whatsoever.

It's time to put an end to this dispute. I, for one, believe that Kodomo no Jikan is undeniably [[lolicon]], as it is blatantly pedophilic in nature. Why? Because of the [[:File:Kodomo no Jikan TV-DVD comparison.jpg|sexualization]] of 9 year old girls, the forbidden relationship between the 23 year old teacher (the main character) and his 9 year old student (they even engage in sexual intercourse in the manga's final chapter), and the fact that this stance is further validated by an industry professional, Zac Bertschy, who writes for [[Anime News Network]]. Quoting his [https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2007-05-18 Answerman entry], " This is - I think, anyway - the first '''lolicon''' title that's explicit enough to be released here with shrinkwrap, so the potential for danger is probably higher than it is with yaoi manga, but for right now I'm not sure I'd be panicked about this release."

This is effectively an [[WP:ATTACK|attack page]]. Its only purpose is to disparage its subject (China) by presenting the topic with a significant pro-U.S. slant, to the extent that it reads more like sinophobic propaganda rather than neutral encyclopedic content. I have no explicit views on the matter, but this article really wants me to support the Trump administration. That is not what Wikipedia articles are intended to be.

I had cold feet on actually nominating this for speedy deletion ''as'' an attack page, but then I realized that might be considered [[WP:POINT]]y (since usually a G10 is used for actual libel. I have not seen it applied to any article whose content has reached a point that it is effectively a biased attack against one of its subjects—person, [[Corporate personhood|corporate person]], nation, or not). I think this article, at this rate, needs to be restarted and rewritten neutrally from the start, so that we can present objective information without bias on this crucial trade dispute. <span style="border:1px solid #445A38;padding:1px;">[[User:ViperSnake151|<span style="color:#8f5902">ViperSnake151</span>]] [[User_talk:ViperSnake151|<span style="color:#fff;background:#88A976;">&nbsp;Talk&nbsp;</span>]] </span> 16:46, 27 May 2019 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Until a few years ago the sole purpose of PRIMARYTOPIC was to arrange articles by titles in a manner that made the articles most likely to be sought the easiest (fewest clicks) ones to find. As such, the only criteria associated with it was the usage criteria:
* {{tq|A topic is '''primary''' for a term with respect to {{em|usage}} if it is highly likely—much more likely than any other single topic, and more likely than all the other topics combined—to be the topic sought when a reader searches for that term.}}
The idea is that anyone searching with, say, "wish you were here" is most likely looking for the Pink Floyd album, and so that's where they should be taken. However, some editors felt "primary" implied some level of relative long-term importance, and, after much discussion, the long-term significance criteria was added so that there was policy basis for taking relative importance under consideration when deciding on primary topic. However, this leads to conflicting guidance in situations where the two criteria indicate different titles.  Should we help readers get to the Pink Floyd album because that's what the vast majority are seeking, or should we put a dab page at [[Wish You Were Here]] and make everyone go through all that even though the vast majority is looking for the album?

I've long believed that if PRIMARYTOPIC was named something else, without the term "primary", then people wouldn't be so hung up on putting what they believe to be the "most important" article at the basename of the title.  Therefore, in order to resolve these conflicts in a consistent fashion, and to help our users by arranging our articles so that articles most likely to be sought with a given term are where those terms lead, I hereby propose:
# Rename PRIMARYTOPIC to MOSTSOUGHTTOPIC
# Remove the long-term significance criteria

{{u|Attic Salt}} contends that : "A supernova  is a transient astronomical event that occurs during the last stages of the life of a massive star or white dwarf, the destruction of which is marked by a titanic explosion."[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Supernova&action=historysubmit&type=revision&diff=903964658&oldid=903956147]  They justify this addition by saying: "Since the article discusses SN from both massive stars and white dwarfs, the defining first sentence can't mention one without mentioning the other, otherwise the reader will be confused."[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASupernova&action=historysubmit&type=revision&diff=903870377&oldid=903839965] Yet they still think: "No, it doesn’t say “all” white dwarfs, but rather “a” white dwarf."[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Supernova&type=revision&diff=903964658&oldid=903956147]

As white dwarf stars above the limit (called the Chandrasekhar limit) of about 1.4 Solar masses will go supernova, but as given in initial statement (above) plainly infers that ALL white dwarfs go supernova.

There is also a contradiction, in that saying: "...that occurs during the last stages of the life of a massive star or white dwarf…", when a white dwarf is considered as ended its life as a star because it no longer creates energy by fusion while energy by a white dwarf is created by gravitational contraction.

This statement is therefore false and a fallacy. 

Knowing that the number of these stars near 1.4 solar masses are rare, with the majority being less than this mass. Also these single white dwarf stars were likely once massive stars. Furthermore, the vast majority of massive stars, do go supernova.

Should "or white dwarf" in this statement be removed to fix this fallacy? 04:07, 29 June 2019 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Which of the following criteria should be used for inclusion in the list?

A.  This list also contains "marquisates of usage", which may only be courtesy titles used by descendants of those who assumed titles, or may be legally created but incompletely documented marquisates. Due to loss of records in fires, wars and deliberate destruction during the French revolution, it has not been established that these seigneuries were ever raised to formal marquisates. Recent archive findings have shown that some titles previously believed to be only courtesy titles are, in fact, raised marquisates.

B.  For reasons of reliability, this list must contains only legal and authentic titles of marquisates with reference sources and not [[courtesy titles]] of marquisates without any evidence that these titles were officialy raised or recognized as marquisates by a French sovereign.

State your opinion only with a brief reason in the Survey as A or B, where A is the previous version of the criterion.  Do not reply to other statements in the Survey.  You may discuss civilly in the Threaded Discussion. [[User:Robert McClenon|Robert McClenon]] ([[User talk:Robert McClenon|talk]]) 15:46, 1 June 2019 (UTC)}}

This has been disputed several times recently, so I am starting an official RFC on the matter. Does [[Shane McMahon]] winning the [[SmackDown Tag Team Championship]] mean he becomes an active roster participant rather than administrative role? Does [[Drake Maverick]] winning the [[WWE 24/7 Championship]] mean that he is now a 205 wrestler rather than GM? Does [[Becky Lynch]] winning the [[Raw Women's Championship]] mean that she is a Raw wrestler while still being listed as SmackDown on WWE.com?

Does winning a championship make you a wrestler? Should a wrestler winning a different brand's championship mean they should switch brands? In short, does winning a championship dictate your placement, or should it just be included as a note. - '''''[[User:Galatz|<span style="color: #000080">Galatz גאליץ</span>]][[User_talk:Galatz|<span style="color: #FF0000"><sup>שיחה Talk</sup></span>]]''''' 16:19, 2 July 2019 (UTC)}}

: ''See also {{Oldid2|892305910|RFC_Ignore_All_Rules_for_50th_anniversary_of_the_Apollo_11_moon_landing|RfC to IAR for DYK}}''
This RfC is to determine what to do on the Main Page during the week of the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11.

Here are some possible options:
*'''Option 1''': Run all the FAs ([[Neil Armstrong]], [[Buzz Aldrin]], [[Michael Collins (astronaut)]], and [[Apollo 11]]) during the week of July 16 thru July 24 with exact dates to be determined later.
*'''Option 2''': Only have [[Neil Armstrong]] as TFA and construct the July 21 Main Page something like so: [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Space 2019/Main Page/July 21]] with Collins appearing at DYK, Aldrin at OTD, and Apollo 11 at TFP. However, reserve the TFAs of [[Michael Collins (astronaut)]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] to be posted at a later date (like their birthdays, etc.). Also reserve [[Apollo 11]] for a later date.
*'''Option 3''': A combination of the above two options where all FAs appear during the week and July 21 is constructed like [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Space 2019/Main Page/July 21]].
*'''Option 4''': Follow the established policies and guidelines. Do not have so many similar subjects featured on the Main Page during the same week.
*''Added'' '''Option 5''': Use the Obama/McCain model, randomizing which FA appears on July 21.
*''Added'' '''Option 5a''': Use the Obama/McCain model, randomizing all 4 FAs to appear for 48 hours on July 20 and July 21.
Options 1, 2 and 3 require a some application of [[WP:IAR]]. Note that there has been [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Did_you_know&oldid=892305910#RFC_Ignore_All_Rules_for_50th_anniversary_of_the_Apollo_11_moon_landing a previous RfC about DYK].

One hit wonder is not a neutral term and kind of offensive. I don't think Wikipedia should be labeling artists as such in an article. If Wikipedia has to have such an article however it should be based on on objective standard. Wayne Jancik is someone who has devoted himself to the study of the phenomena and has come up with a concrete definition that has been sanctioned by being published by Billboard the official arbiter of American pop music charts. In America placing on the Top 40 is widely considered the defining quality of being a hit. It is not based on how much a song is remember by a particular audience which varies based on the musical interests of the audience in question anyways. I for one know and love a lot of songs by the artists currently listed on this page. I can overlook their inclusion if these songs are unknown by a significant enough number of people as calculated by their failure to place on the Top 40. What annoys me though is artists like A Flock of Seagulls and a-ha being listed even while having multiple songs that placed on the Top 40 and are still listened to by a lot of people are included.

A major argument against the Top 40 criteria was that this constitutes original research. Since Jancik's series of books list every artist to place in the Top 40 up to about 1992 it wouldn't be original research to list the one hit wonders of the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s as represented by objective data. These eras were free of complications like artists without physical releases not placing on the charts, artists being featured on tracks of others that become hits (as has become common since the 2000s) and the like - so not a lot of complications would arise from this. The Top 40 was indisputably the metric to judge what constitutes a hit in this period. [[User:CaptainPrimo|CaptainPrimo]] ([[User talk:CaptainPrimo|talk]]) 06:57, 9 July 2019 (UTC)}}

Catalonia is part of Spain, so the autonomous community taking part in the Eurovision Song Contest (2020) is unlikely and probably not feasible due the European Broadcasting Union's rules for entering the contest. However, Catalonia's CCMA and TV3 have aspirations to join similar to other, fully-fledged countries, which has been reported on frequently in the past. This leaves the question, should Catalonia be included in our list of potential candidate broadcasters? This is an [[WP:RFC|RfC]], please reply with either '''Include''' or '''Exclude''', coupled with an explanation for the stance provided. As long as this discussion is open, Catalonia should not be removed from the list to avoid edit warring.

== Can you say "Brenton Tarrant" in the lead yet? '''

I've only just read this article today and it seems bizarre that Tarrant's name is not mentioned in the lead or infobox. I see there was a previous RFC, the objections were along the lines of:

''[[WP:NOTNEWS]] Too soon to include the name of the suspect.'' 

:Most of these votes were within days of the shooting and was right and proper to wait for reliable sources in the wake of a major incident. Since then Tarrant has appeared in court several times with 92 charges brought against him. There are plenty of reliable sources stating that he is the suspect and what the charges against him are.

''[[WP:BLPCRIME]] This is a living person with the right to the presumption of innocence.'' 

:The lead and info box must make it very clear that at this time Tarrant a '''suspect''' charged with the crimes and not refer to him in any other way which would pre-judge the outcome of the case.

''[[WP:NOTNOTABLE]] Undue prominence of a non notable person.'' 
:There is strong evidence that Tarrant seeks notoriety and people are loath to give his name more prominence that is absolutely necessary. There was a period of self censorship of Tarrant's name in New Zealand news media and even the New Zealand Prime Minister has vowed to not speak his name. However, the fact is that Tarrant has gained instant notoriety as the suspect in this mass shooting and there is no name suppression. 

Let's remember [[WP:NOTCENSORED]]. Put Tarrant's name in the lead and infobox as the suspect in this case, the article is incomplete without it.

Currently, one of the most backlogged processes is [[WP:ACC|Request an Account (ACC)]] , which exists mainly (though not entirely) for helping with 3 purposes: Those having trouble completing CAPTCHA; enabling the choosing of a username that is too similar to an existing username under certain circumstances & creating an account for those hindered by a rangeblock.

The current backlog on pending requests is 4 months.

In the last couple of months multiple editors have signed up to be ACC tool users, Tool users are signed up to the confidentiality agreement and meet various [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Request_an_account/Guide#Qualifications_for_using_the_interface other criteria]. 

Currently here are limits, however, on both their ability to create accounts. Two options could ease their work. 

#Raise the local account creation rate limit from 4 to 10. The new limit only to extended-confirmed users to prevent any abusive behaviour from IPs.
#Automatically grant [[Wikipedia:Account creator|account creator]] permission, on request, to new ACC tool users. This would allow them both to bypass the limit entirely, but would also let them ignore the antispoof and title blacklist when making accounts.

I am requesting comment on the acceptability of having the release year mentioned in this article changed from 1991 to 1989. I believe the 1991 release year stated in the article is incorrect, possibly due to citogenesis. There is an article [https://news3lv.com/around-the-web/the-case-of-an-iconic-watch-how-wikipedia-and-writers-create-false-facts-from-thin-air here] and a parts listing [https://www.pacparts.com/library/model.cfm?mfg=Casio&model_id=F91W-1&action=list_part&back=0 here] pointing to the correct release date being June of 1989. I have posted to RSN regarding reliability of the former source (news3lv) and have been told it's a reliable secondary source. The latter source (PacParts listing) was mentioned to be a usable primary source regarding release year in the same RSN response.

For full disclosure, this topic has been mentioned in a watch enthusiast discord that I({{u|Jacepulaski}}), {{u|Casio F91W-1}} and {{u|J0kerNL}} all participate in. I am very new to editing Wikipedia and have never done so before, and as such have had recent help from participants in [[WP:Discord]] to learn about contributing to talk page discussions but who also instructed me of their [[WP:CANVASS]]ing concerns. This has not been my intention, and I have asked all members of the watch enthusiasts discord to either not participate in this RFC, or to self-identify as being a member of it.[[User:Jacepulaski|Jacepulaski]] ([[User talk:Jacepulaski|talk]]) 14:01, 17 June 2019 (UTC)}}

I dispute the previous consensus, because it was ended prematurely by a user. A lot of the reason for the closing were more personal rather then about the image and I find this unfair and both the initial proposed and alternative image I added on there didn't get a chance to be evaluate properly, again, it was mostly personal remarks about the user (me) then the actual photo. I just want to see what others think/decide which of the follow should be used at a unbiased, neutral approach on it. 

Main reason why I oppose the grey image being used is stuff such as the white reflection effect on the windshield and bonnet on the grey car, the blue one has less then that and the headlights aren't fogged up due to where it was taken and are clear and sharp. It also been taken from a weird elevated place while the blue one was photographed at standing height. There also red splodge sources around the grille and bumper which the blue car also doesn't has. The image tilted which I believe was done so it can be promoted to QI, since one of the guidelines for promoting a image to QI is the tilt/perspective should be corrected, even if it means the car isn't at a angle you want it to be. I also believe preferring a image over the other simply because it a QI (the grey car) is irrational due to the several problems I stated above. --[[User:Vauxford|Vauxford]] ([[User talk:Vauxford|talk]]) 13:04, 16 June 2019 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Recently, [[User:Nableezy]] added <code><nowiki>{{short description|Israeli settlement in the West Bank/Golan Heights}}</nowiki></code> to this article and a bunch of others. It is my opinion that this short description should be refined, here as well as in those other articles. In the case of Beitar e.g. that should be "Israeli city in the West Bank", in the case of [[Neve Ativ]] e.g. "Israeli moshav in the Golan Heights", etc.

Likewise it is my opinion that the first sentence of these articles should avoid wording like "Israeli settlement incorporated as a city/moshav", which these articles presently is part of their lead sentence in many cases. This is 1. unnecessarily verbose, 2. not the way we usually start article about [[human settlement]]s, and 3. redundant to the continuation of the lead which invariably contains some explanation to the fact that "The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank/Golan Heights illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this."

I am well aware that all of these are [[Israeli settlement]]s, just hold that the short description should be as refined as possible, while the fact that these cities/moshavs etc. are in the West Bank or the Golan Heights explains clearly enough that they are in the general category of "Israeli settlements".

Should this article have a lead image? One view is that we shouldn't use a lead image because no lead image can adequately represent this topic, and [[MOS:LEADIMAGE]] addresses this type of thing. Another view is that a single lead image does not give the impression of representing all people, but simply represents an example of a person or persons. For backstory on this matter, see the [[Talk:African Americans#Reverted recently added lead image]] section on the article's talk page.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/06/13/waksom-texas-outlaws-abortion-five-men/?utm_term=.7b8c20fef7a2 There was a vote from the Waskom, Texas city council to ban abortion], even though abortion is allowed nationwide as per a Supreme Court ruling; this was covered in national newspapers. As of writing it is too early to tell how often/whether coverage of the same event will continue at national, statewide, and local levels.

The question is whether this vote is a significant enough detail to include in the history of the town. One editor argues that as per [[WP:NOTNEWS]] it is not significant enough, while myself and another editor disagree.  Please see the above discussion.

{{rfcquote|text=
I want to include the list of the Twelve Apostles in the lede by including a short pullquote from the [[Book of Luke]], which lists all twelve traditional apostles. Now this quote is dated from an exact moment in history, according to the Bible, where Jesus appointed the Twelve, before the removal of Judas Iscariot, and before his replacement with Paul of Tarsus. 

User:Epinoia makes it clear that he's firmly against the inclusion of the list, and has come up with a number of reasons, most of which are a kind of argument of Biblical errancy (sic "inerrancy"), where quoting the Book of Luke is improper because the same list doesn't appear in the other Gospels, and the number "Twelve" is some kind of fabrication, either because at some point there were dozens of apostles, or because Judas and Paul were simultaneously apostles, bumping the number up to thirteen. My argument is that the Twelve be identified and listed, quoting directly from the Bible, on the topic of the "Twelve Apostles" which is one of the subtitles of the article. -[[User:ApexUnderground|ApexUnderground]] ([[User talk:ApexUnderground|talk]]) 01:32, 21 June 2019 (UTC)}}

I stumbled on the page after being a bit fidgety with the search box, when a result hint for the page in question came up.  Based on its name, I was curious to know what were some of the future plans for Wikipedia.  My prediction for what the page contained was somewhat correct, as it contained what seemed to be a to-do list with what changes are to be done with [[Wikipedia]].  It even talks about some of the yearly [[Peer Reviews]] and [[FAC]]s.  Well that is what it seems to have originally been intended for.  Unfortunately however, as I will discuss somewhere bellow, the page was visited and overridden by other Wikipedians, as well as multiple IP users, who used the page as a to-do list for what they wanted to do on Wikipedia.  Also, some of the tasks there seem convoluted and unrelated or hard to understand.  

It seems that the page is originally intended for bettering the article [[Wikipedia]], so that it can become a featured article.  Thus more caution must come when changing or deleting content that is on that page; I hope you know what is the name of this website, otherwise there is an issue.  Because of that, I felt that placing the page on any 'for deletion' noticeboard would be a bit wrong, as it would require a consensus from a lot more users.

An [[WP:RFC]] has been filed to bring editors to a consensus on various issues regarding the Tuo Chiang-class corvette. There are two conflicts here, the first is conflict is around the class's Hsiung Feng III missiles and the second is around the capabilities of the Corvette itself.

'''First''', is the HF-3 hypersonic and nuclear armed? See [[Talk:Hsiung Feng III#RfC On Sources, Nukes, and Speed]] 

'''Second''', is the language currently used to describe the class’s superlatives moving into puffery territory or is it still supported by the sources?

Hi all

I just wanted to query the POTD currently scheduled at [[Template:POTD/2019-10-28]]. As far as I'm aware, the convention has been that even though [[WP:NOTCENSORED]] applies to articles, we don't include very graphic images of genitalia on the main page. Thus images such as [[:File:Tako to ama retouched.jpg|this]], [[:File:Indecency2.jpg|this]], and even [[:File:Michele Merkin 1.jpg|this]] are listed at [[Wikipedia:Picture of the day/Unused]] as images which, despite being featured pictures, are not suitable for POTD. I personally think that's a sensible policy, and I've added the hermaphrodite picture to the unused list, but would welcome second/third opinions here please. Pinging {{u|Adam Cuerden}}, who created the template in question. Thanks &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Amakuru|Amakuru]] ([[User talk:Amakuru|talk]]) 22:06, 13 July 2019 (UTC)}}

{{u|Attic Salt}} contends that : "A supernova  is a transient astronomical event that occurs during the last stages of the life of a massive star or white dwarf, the destruction of which is marked by a titanic explosion."[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Supernova&action=historysubmit&type=revision&diff=903964658&oldid=903956147]  They justify this addition by saying: "Since the article discusses SN from both massive stars and white dwarfs, the defining first sentence can't mention one without mentioning the other, otherwise the reader will be confused."[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASupernova&action=historysubmit&type=revision&diff=903870377&oldid=903839965] Yet they still think: "No, it doesn’t say “all” white dwarfs, but rather “a” white dwarf."[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Supernova&type=revision&diff=903964658&oldid=903956147]

As white dwarf stars above the limit (called the Chandrasekhar limit) of about 1.4 Solar masses will go supernova, but as given in initial statement (above) plainly infers that ALL white dwarfs go supernova.

There is also a contradiction, in that saying: "...that occurs during the last stages of the life of a massive star or white dwarf…", when a white dwarf is considered as ended its life as a star because it no longer creates energy by fusion while energy by a white dwarf is created by gravitational contraction.

This statement is therefore false and a fallacy. 

Knowing that the number of these stars near 1.4 solar masses are rare, with the majority being less than this mass. Also these single white dwarf stars were likely once massive stars. Furthermore, the vast majority of massive stars, do go supernova.

Should "or white dwarf" in this statement be removed to fix this fallacy? 04:07, 29 June 2019 (UTC)}}

Summary for the RFC listing: Should any FRAM-related resignation where the resigning editor performed controversial actions relating to WP:FRAM be considered [[WP:CLOUD|under a cloud?]] 
I am asking because of the following quotation from the July 2 WMF Board statement: 
{{tq|We do not consider any of the admin resignations related to the current events to be “[[WP:CLOUD|under a cloud]]” (under suspicion) though we also realize that the final decision with respect to this lies with the community.}}
I am asking in the hypothetical event that users who resigned under controversial circumstances relating to WP:FRAM such as [[User:Floquenbeam|Floquenbeam]], [[User:BU Rob13|BU Rob 13]], [[User:WJBScribe|WJBScribe]], and any other past or possible future resigner resigning under controversial circumstances relating to WP:FRAM would ask for their tools back. If they're not considered to be under a cloud, they can simply request them back at the [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats' Noticeboard|Bureaucrats' Noticeboard]], but if they are considered to be under a cloud, then they'll have to go through the standard RFA procedure. According to the board, while they don't consider these under a cloud, it's up to us as a community to decide whether or not they're under a cloud, and I felt it would be smart to have that consensus ready in advance, even if these requests are unlikely to occur from those I just mentioned. A "no-consensus" result would leave the Board's view as precedent, leaving the effects of a "no consensus" the same as a "no" !vote consensus in response to the question, should the result be "no consensus".

This has been disputed several times recently, so I am starting an official RFC on the matter. Does [[Shane McMahon]] winning the [[SmackDown Tag Team Championship]] mean he becomes an active roster participant rather than administrative role? Does [[Drake Maverick]] winning the [[WWE 24/7 Championship]] mean that he is now a 205 wrestler rather than GM? Does [[Becky Lynch]] winning the [[Raw Women's Championship]] mean that she is a Raw wrestler while still being listed as SmackDown on WWE.com?

Does winning a championship make you a wrestler? Should a wrestler winning a different brand's championship mean they should switch brands? In short, does winning a championship dictate your placement, or should it just be included as a note. - '''''[[User:Galatz|<span style="color: #000080">Galatz גאליץ</span>]][[User_talk:Galatz|<span style="color: #FF0000"><sup>שיחה Talk</sup></span>]]''''' 16:19, 2 July 2019 (UTC)}}

Myself and {{u|Woovee}} disagree about the inclusion of a short section in this article about the bands [[Mickey Finn's T-Rex]] and [[X-T. Rex]] (formerly [[Bill Legend's T. Rex]]) which feature former T.Rex members (and either currently or formerly featured members of the "classic" 1971-1973 lineup) and which both promote themselves as reunions of T.Rex. <br> 
Woovee's opinion is that these bands should not be mentioned in the T.Rex article as they are irrelevant and an offence to the principle that there can be no T.Rex without the involvement of [[Marc Bolan]] and that such a section only serves to promote these two bands.<br>
My opinion is that these bands both have their own Wikipedia articles (and one of the two is undoubtely Wiki-notable, the other at least deserves a redirect) and so are significant spin-offs of the band regardless of their authenticity as T.Rex lineups, and that in any case "''No Bolan No T.Rex''" is a POV.

I would like to pursue the point about whether the amount of material on Corbyn pre his leadership is WP:UNDUE in this article. I think there is some relevance but that the length is excessive, particularly as it is covered on his profile where it is available for reference. Moreover, reducing this section will contribute to reducing the overall length of the article, which I anticipate continuing to grow. Can I suggest we have a vote on this to clear it up by everyone putting these three options in order of preference with regard to section 6.1. in this article i.e. ''Events involving Jeremy Corbyn as a backbencher''?

'''A'''  Replace the section in this article with a sentence and link to the relevant section in his profile

'''B'''  Replace the section in this article with the relevant [[Jeremy Corbyn#Allegations of antisemitism|section in his profile]], resulting in the two articles having the same text regarding the period before he became leader. The section in his profile is shorter and was arrived at after some discussion and amendment amongst the editors involved.

'''C'''  Leave section 6.1 unchanged. [[User:Jontel|Jontel]] ([[User talk:Jontel|talk]]) 15:56, 6 July 2019 (UTC)}}

‎Hi, I start this RFC a follow up to [[Wikipedia talk:Non-free content/Archive 66#Application of WP:NFC#UUI #17|this discussion]], which did not yield a clear consensus. It's an issue of the applicability of WP:NFC#UUI #17 to football teams and clubs. The questions the community have been disputed about for years are actually very simple:

Taking into account [[WP:NFC#UUI #17]],
# Are the premier (i.e. those that compete in the premier competitions like the FIFA World Cup and continual cups) national teams (both mem and women's) child entities of the national football associations?
# Are the junior national football teams (e.g. U21, U19,...) child entities of the premier national football teams or of the national football associations?
# Are women's football clubs child entities of men's football clubs?

The final question that strems from the above three question's answers is:
*Is it acceptable per the NFC guidelines to add the shirt badges/crests to the articles on either premier national football teams, junior national football teams and/or women's football clubs?

Please post your responses below.[[User:Tvx1|T]][[User Talk:Tvx1|v]][[Special:Contributions/Tvx1|x]]1 17:48, 18 July 2019 (UTC)}}

Hello there. I'd like to see what other editors think in regards to the use of the word "The" in band names in parentheses in the titles of articles about songs and albums.

However, there are also numerous articles where this is NOT the case: for example, "[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|''Smile'' (The Beach Boys album)]]" or "[[Smash Hits (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|''Smash Hits'' (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)]]".

That is {{la|African humid period}} (disclaimer: I am the author of that) and {{la|Neolithic Subpluvial}}, which both currently cover a similar, if not identical, topic. The former is considerably longer than the latter and was written in late 2018, while Neolithic Subpluvial was written in August 2007.

First off, a ''mea culpa'': When I wrote African humid period I did not at first think about what the relationship between the two pages should be, and I should have. This led to a [[Talk:African_humid_period#Merger_discussion_with_Neolithic_subpluvial|merger discussion in January-February 2019 which ended in no consensus due to lack of participation and concerns about the size of the resulting merged page]], and an [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Neolithic Subpluvial|Articles for deletion discussion]] (arguably not a good place, as the question was not really about deletion) a few weeks ago which ended today into a no consensus as well with a variety of opinions and with several suggestions of redirection or redefinition. The closing statement indicated that if further discussion is warranted - and even the most conservative statements in the AFD indicated that some repurposing of Neolithic Subpluvial would be necessary - it should take place on a talk page.

So the question here (taken from the deletion discussion) is whether Neolithic Subpluvial should a) be merged/redirected into AHP, b) it should be redefined to a Sahara/Sahel-specific variant of AHP, c) redefined (and possibly renamed) to cover "green Sahara" periods more generally i.e not limited to the late [[Pleistocene]]-early [[Holocene]] version thereof or d) something else altogether.

The article includes a plot summary for a film that has not entered general release, and is not sourced to secondary citations. [[MOS:FILMPLOT]] does not usually require a citation because the film itself is regarded as a primary source; however, exceptions to this include "upcoming" and "lost" films which are not available to the public to verify, and in such cases MOS:FILMPLOT requires a secondary source. Since the film is not currently "available to the public to verify" (it was made briefly available to a select audience at the Cannes film festival) does the lack of availability and a secondary citation mean that the summary violates [[WP:Verifiability]] and [[MOS:FILMPLOT]]?

We struggle with issues of undisclosed paid editors both supporting and opposing AfD. Example include [[User:Sora Sailor]].

Some of these undisclosed paid editor accounts do so to try to extort money out of people (for deletion). And others so they can get money from the person in question.

In my opinion this probably will be partly helped by limiting these discussions to extended auto confirmed users. French Wikipedia does something similar were they move all comments that are made by an editor with less than 50 edits.

I think that liberal-conservavism label should be removed from the opening parapgraph and the infobox. It is cited in the ''Leadership of Casado and 2019 election'' section that the party shifted further to the right in 2018. Both sources that cite the party as liberal-conservative are years before this (one is from 2014 and one is from 2005). This is when the party was under different leadership and not as far to the right as it is today. I have seen no sources since Pablo Casado became the leader of the party that describe it as liberal-consevative, so I would say this is out of date and should be removed. However, this is cited information, so I'm looking to form a consenus here before removing it. Please leave any and all thoughts below.

Dear editors, 
Currently the top notice says that the article covers until 1453, with Ottoman Constantinople discussed at [[Istanbul]]. I want to change the "hard limit" of the page until 1930, for the following reasons:
# The city was known in the west and in western languages as "Constantinople" until the Turkish law required the use of Istanbul in 1930 (I believe it was officially known as Constantinople ''in Turkish'' prior to 1923?)
# [[Istanbul]] is currently a featured article, and covering too much detail about Ottoman history there may put undue weight as people reading that page may want more of a focus on ''modern'' Istanbul. Having this set to 1930 allows adding of additional info that may not necessarily fit at "Istanbul".
# Many aspects covered in city articles (such as Media, formal western Education, and formal diplomatic relations) were undeveloped in Byzantine periods and did not develop until late Ottoman rule: it can comfortably cover the types of schools in the city, the newspapers printed in the city, etc.
:* Note: I am not advocating for removing all traces of Ottoman Constantinople from [[Istanbul]], but instead I want to allow adding of Ottoman info and the first seven years of the Turkish republic to this article, with these two periods sort of overlapping with [[Istanbul]]. In other words, have Ottoman stuff go in both [[Constantinople]] and "Istanbul" but with the amount of coverage/detail differing according to weight.

Even though there is no recent talk page discussion on this, I felt filing an RFC would be for the best since the Ottoman Empire project is moribund, and it may be good to get many editors to discuss this.

*Should we agree to halt the use of RFCs containing four options for "general (un)reliability" of a source, particularly when said RFC contains no specific instances of claims or citations?
*While it may be useful to [[WP:RSP|deprecate heavily-used and clearly-unreliable sources]], the corollary is not true: Wikipedia is unable to promote a source to "reliable for any assertion about any topic whatsoever"; [[WP:IRS|reliability is always assessed based on the nature of the claims being made]].
*With these parameters in mind, is it futile for us to continually open RFCs here on [[WP:RSN]] if an outcome of "generally reliable for everything" is counter-productive and misleading?

Recently, [[User:Nableezy]] added <code><nowiki>{{short description|Israeli settlement in the West Bank/Golan Heights}}</nowiki></code> to this article and a bunch of others. It is my opinion that this short description should be refined, here as well as in those other articles. In the case of Beitar e.g. that should be "Israeli city in the West Bank", in the case of [[Neve Ativ]] e.g. "Israeli moshav in the Golan Heights", etc.

Likewise it is my opinion that the first sentence of these articles should avoid wording like "Israeli settlement incorporated as a city/moshav", which these articles presently is part of their lead sentence in many cases. This is 1. unnecessarily verbose, 2. not the way we usually start article about [[human settlement]]s, and 3. redundant to the continuation of the lead which invariably contains some explanation to the fact that "The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank/Golan Heights illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this."

I am well aware that all of these are [[Israeli settlement]]s, just hold that the short description should be as refined as possible, while the fact that these cities/moshavs etc. are in the West Bank or the Golan Heights explains clearly enough that they are in the general category of "Israeli settlements".

Back in 2017 a consensus developed on the article talk page that even though there was a great deal being said about his mental health in sources, we should not say anything on the subject in the article. In 2018 an article [[Health of Donald Trump]] was written which was primarily about his mental health. In June 2019 that article was AfD’ed, with the result to merge it to the Donald Trump article. Since the article being merged was primarily about mental health, a paragraph on the subject was developed at the Trump talk page and added to the article; it is now the final paragraph in the “Health and lifestyle” section. Some people have deleted it or objected to it, so we are seeking a definitive answer to the question: should we have a paragraph about his mental health? The question here is whether we should have something or nothing. Exact wording can be debated later, if the conclusion here is that, yes, we should say something on the subject. In the meantime the paragraph at issue should remain in the article.-- [[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 01:05, 18 July 2019 (UTC)}}

The purpose of this RFC is to determine what are considered to be the purposes of portals. 

Some of the purposes that have been proposed are:
:1. Showcasing our best content to readers. The Main Page, for example, is a portal with this very purpose. The Main Page is also very labor-intensive. Showcasing is work.
:2. Navigating the encyclopedia. Along with lists, navigation templates, and categories, portals are one way readers can [[WP:NAVIGATION|navigate the encyclopedia]].
:3. Containing content not available elsewhere on the encyclopedia. Some editors have stated that portals contain content, so that content is harmfully deleted when portals are deleted.
:3A. Unique, forked or transcluded encyclopedic content
:3B. Explanatory content such as guidance and reviews (others?)
:4. Planning and management of WikiProjects. Portals allow editors to keep track of the current and planned scope of the project's coverage.
:5. Metatext and reviews of the topic.
:6. A statement of the importance of the topic.  The provision that portals should be about "broad subject areas" is more commonly remembered and quoted than the qualifying clause, "which will attract readers and portal maintainers".  A portal is seen as a declaration that a topic is a broad subject area.
:7. An invitation to readers and editors to develop particular articles in a topic area.
:8. Fun, or exercise.  Some editors like making portals.

In the Survey, please specify between 0 and N (currently 8) purposes that you think are valid purposes of [[WP:Portals|portals]].  You may add numbered purposes to the end of list and !vote for them also.

Threaded discussion may take place in the Threaded Discussion section.

If it isn’t, then we can go [[back to square one]] and adopt a new portal guideline, or we can we [[WP:UCS|Use Common Sense]].  

The key sentence of the guideline is, and has been for more than a decade:
'''Please bear in mind that portals should be about broad subject areas, which are likely to attract large numbers of interested readers and portal maintainers.'''

If the guideline is adopted or re-adopted, changes to it can be made by another RFC.  

Please Support or Oppose adoption or re-adoption of the guideline in the Survey.  The Threaded Discussion section is for back-and-forth discussion.

One of the biggest issues with any RfC about activity requirements is that they fail because no one likes specific proposals. To try to deal with that issue, I'm starting the first of what is a potential two part RfC with the following options:
#'''Option 1: The status quo''' – the resysop criteria for inactivity should remain the same.
#'''Option 2: Stricter''' – the resysop criteria for inactivity should be made stricter in some way.
#'''Option 3: Looser''' – the resysop criteria for inactivity should be made less strict.
Ideally, if option 2 or 3 gain consensus, a second RfC focusing on specific proposals based on the principle that achieves consensus would take place. The goal here is to see what the community consensus on the status of the current policy is, not to discuss specific proposals.

{{rfcquote|text=
I stumbled on the page after being a bit fidgety with the search box, when a result hint for the page in question came up.  Based on its name, I was curious to know what were some of the future plans for Wikipedia.  My prediction for what the page contained was somewhat correct, as it contained what seemed to be a to-do list with what changes are to be done with [[Wikipedia]].  It even talks about some of the yearly [[Peer Reviews]] and [[FAC]]s.  Well that is what it seems to have originally been intended for.  Unfortunately however, as I will discuss somewhere bellow, the page was visited and overridden by other Wikipedians, as well as multiple IP users, who used the page as a to-do list for what they wanted to do on Wikipedia.  Also, some of the tasks there seem convoluted and unrelated or hard to understand.  

It seems that the page is originally intended for bettering the article [[Wikipedia]], so that it can become a featured article.  Thus more caution must come when changing or deleting content that is on that page; I hope you know what is the name of this website, otherwise there is an issue.  Because of that, I felt that placing the page on any 'for deletion' noticeboard would be a bit wrong, as it would require a consensus from a lot more users.

Hi all. I have recently closed a requested move discussion on [[Steve Smith (cricketer)]] (located [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Steve_Smith_(cricketer)&oldid=907488300#Requested_move_14_July_2019 here]) which I determined there was no consensus. In short, those supporting the move to a further disambiguated article title argued that the current title was an incomplete disambiguation. Those opposing the move argued the article subject was the primary topic, and similar to some other cricketer articles (e.g. [[James Anderson (cricketer)]]), should be titled without their year of birth. Through reading this guideline, I was not able to determine how to title articles when there is a conflict between [[WP:INCDAB]] and [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]], so I am opening an RFC to see if we can determine which takes precedence in future discussions. The options forward I see (there may be others) are:

*'''Option 1''': INCDAB takes precedence over PRIMARYTOPIC
*'''Option 2''': PRIMARYTOPIC takes precedence over INCDAB

I would appreciate the community's thoughts on this matter. <font face="Verdana">[[User:Steven Crossin|<font color="#078330">Steven</font>]] [[User talk:Steven Crossin|<font color="#2875b0">Crossin</font>]] <sup>[[WP:DRN/V|<font color="#d67f0f">Help resolve disputes!</font>]]</sup></font>  07:56, 23 July 2019 (UTC)}}

In an effort to stop going around in circles, let's try to clarify where everyone stands on the various possibilities.  I believe that all of the below descriptors have support from reliable sources.  I have not included any mention of '''''not''''' being on the right at all, because I do not believe there is a reliable source to support that possibility. If someone wants to vote that way, they '''''must''''' provide a ''bona fide'' reliable source to support their vote, or it will be struck.

Here are the choices:

*'''A. right wing'''
*'''B. far right (wing)'''
*'''C. extreme right (wing)'''
*'''D. radical right (wing)'''

Please bold your favored descriptor in your answer.  If you can live with a number of these choices, please list them in your order of preference - we'll do a simple statistical analysis of the results.

This is a survey, it's not intended to be threaded discussion -- we've had plenty of that above.  Let's just try and see what people's preferences are. [[User:Beyond My Ken|Beyond My Ken]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken|talk]]) 02:44, 24 July 2019 (UTC)}}

I started a discussion at [[Wikipedia:Bot requests#Civil parish bot]] to have a bot create the missing [[civil parishes]] in England (about 700) but there were a few problems, namely that my instructions weren't clear enough, that it would be violating my creation restriction ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Clarification_and_Amendment&diff=905074773&oldid=905069383 not so]) and that they might not be notable (not so, civil parishes as opposed to ecclesiastical parishes are legally recognized administrative division per [[WP:GEOLAND]]). 

I have created [[User:Crouch, Swale/Bot tasks/Civil parishes (current)/Simple]] which is the current model, there is also [[User:Crouch, Swale/Bot tasks/Civil parishes (current)/Coded]] and [[User:Crouch, Swale/Bot tasks/Civil parishes (current)]] which provide more instructions and some arguments for an against for bot created articles at [[User:Crouch, Swale/Bot tasks/Civil parishes (current)#Process]].

There are 2 questions here, who has the understanding to program such a bot and are there any other things that need to be improves/changed to ensure that this works correctly or to otherwise improve the articles.

It would be good if eventually we could do the same thing for places in other countries to but we'll start with England for now.

Hi, admin ‎MilborneOne proposed this new article to be delete as it says that "Sorry I dont see what education has to do with being a governor or civil servant, looks like a made up connection without little encyclopedic value."

In fact, I got this idea from an list article [[List of heads of Hong Kong by education]]. That article has very little references and has been around since September 2016. I disagree with the view of MilborneOne as it has encyclopedic value.

If insufficient references is the reason for the proposal to delete, I am able to extract some of the information from individual article and put it in the reference. Of course, I will use the reference that are on the web, not using wikipedia as a reference to each individual.

Please help to comment and advice. Thank you in advice. [[User:Flipchip73|Flipchip73]] ([[User talk:Flipchip73|talk]]) 06:30, 27 August 2019 (UTC)}}

This proposal is similar to the proposal that resulted in the [[WP:R4|R4 criterion]] being created by extracting it from the [[WP:G6|G6 criterion]]. At the present time, the [[WP:G14|G14 criterion]] includes a portion near the end of its description that applies ''exclusively'' to redirects:<blockquote>"G14 also applies to orphaned "Foo (disambiguation)" redirects that target pages that are not disambiguation pages or pages that perform a disambiguation-like function (such as [[Wikipedia:set index articles|set index articles]] or lists)."</blockquote>I propose that this sentence be extracted from the G14 criterion to create a new "R5" criterion as follows:
;R5<nowiki>:</nowiki> Redirects ending with "(disambiguation)" that do not target a disambiguation page
:This applies to orphaned "Foo (disambiguation)" redirects that target pages that are not disambiguation pages or pages that perform a disambiguation-like function (such as [[Wikipedia:set index articles|set index articles]] or lists).

==Naming Controversy unresolved on WP'''

Because the issue of the naming controversy is unresolved on WP (meaning one clear policy) the subject is left to subjective interpretation and as a result edit warring.  The article mentions the"Salient Issues affecting the debate"however WP needs a clear consensus to avert and forestall any  edit warring. My personal  opinion is Native American (NA) or native American with the context of a sentence. It is enough that some of the NA community perceive it to be pejorative, aboriginal and indigenous is too wordy and "intellectual", native is sufficient. Using the word Indian is confusing to a younger, less educated reader who might think the article is discussing the Indian subcontinent.[[User:Oldperson|Oldperson]] ([[User talk:Oldperson|talk]]) 20:54, 2 September 2019 (UTC)}}

Recent controversies surrounding Cloudflare involving 8chan and hate groups are the reason for the changed lede, does this change follow WP:NPOV?
Further clarification: the change started with [[User:Domjh]] being accused of bad-faith changes, while he was removing obvious vandalism (https://twitter.com/AVALANCHE_Girls/status/1158137928536731648). The edit that started all of this can ben found here: [[Special:PermaLink/909341255]]. All discussion from that point onward seems focused on preserving some amount of that vandalism, for whatever reason. It's clear I have the appearances against me, having a new account, but I am truly just a random new editor who stumbled across this discussion and took an interest as it seemed "off".
: Update: I took it upon myself to follow the suggestions of more experienced editors and rewrote the lede, better summarising Cloudflare's controversial history in regards to freedom of speech for using multiple perspectives. Thereby leaving the controversial topics in the lede while also adhering the WP:NPOV.

Okay. I know that we changed the padlock system not too long ago. However, I would like to propose a slightly changed version of the padlock. Basically, the only difference is the shape of the shackle, and some of the colours. I changed the colours slightly on a few to keep them seperated and not confused. However, I changed cascade protected because it was the same colour as move, and the link symbol could have been confusing because of the thought that the link meant you cant change the link.

Meghan Murphy is a [[radical feminist]] known for their opposition to [[transgender]] rights and their ban from Twitter for "hateful speech" directed at [[trans women]]. Due to extensive manipulation, including that the original text was created from Meghan Murphy's own published profile by a contributor who has been blocked for disrupting transgender related articles, and while blocked has continued to manipulate the article content and discussions using sockpuppets, I propose that the article is now rebuilt. This is being raised as an RfC to gain a wider consensus, partly because local discussions have been significantly manipulated by confirmed sockpuppetry.

The proposal is to replace with a ''non controversial'' stub, based on only independent [[WP:BLP|BLP]] compliant reliable sources. As a community we can then gradually add sources and material one at a time, ensuring that there is a balance of material in line with policy and documented consensus on controversial topics.

{{rfcquote|text=
Shall we place somewhere in the '''lead''' of tennis player Roger Federer, and many other tennis players, the sentence "He/She is considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time?" This includes variants on this theme.

There has been back and forth on this issue for a lot of tennis players leads as pretty much every player in the Hall of Fame of tennis history is in this category. In the recent past we have been eliminating any subjective terminology such as this from all tennis bio leads and been putting them in legacy sections of prose of the bio, with sourcing of course. When present, these leads get fought over with wording regularly. "One of the greatest", "the greatest" widely considered the greatest", "some call one of the greatest", etc. Encyclopedias [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Roger-Federer such as Britannica] don't use these subjective terms at all with Federer, let alone in the lead. I have found that past players and critics who dole out these subjective headlines to sell papers and magszines, change their minds frequently. It's great for the water cooler but I'm not sure it's great for the lead of biography articles. As long as all tennis player bios are treated the same at wikipedia (such as [[Rod Laver]], [[Steffi Graf]], [[Helen Wills]], [[Pete Sampras]], [[Chris Evert]], [[Jack Kramer]], [[Bill Tilden]], etc...) then I'm ok with whatever decision is made here, however it is probably easier to maintain with no mention in the lead for subjective terms such as "one of the greatest."

In response to an argument that escalated to AN/I about the so-called "fan art" dispute, I proposed that an RFC should be held here, and it was suggested that as an uninvolved editor I try to come up with a neutral question to see if we can reach a community consensus.  Here are what I think the questions are; a '''Yes''' or '''No''' or more nuanced answer on each is requested:
: '''A'''. Does the use in articles of editor-constructed diagrams such as livery details violate [[WP:V]] when the diagrammed details are not verifiably sourced?
: '''B'''. Should British railway articles be allowed to include galleries of livery detail diagrams, of the type that some have characterized as "fan art" (whether or not the included diagrams need to be "sourced" will be determined by answers to '''A''').

Feel free to answer like "Yes A and Yes B" or answer one or the other, or both separately, and optionally qualify your responses in terms of visual impact, image quality, availability of quality photographs as alternatives, and whatever else you think is relevant.

'''Background'''

Some prior discussions that didn't converge:
* [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#Use_of_fan_art_in_articles|at WP:VPP]]
* [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#Tony May and persistent criticism and belittling of other editors on British railways|at WP:AN/I]]

{{u|Qiushufang}} has included Singapore in the above-mentioned template and dropped the template in [[Timeline of Singaporean history]]. His [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_Singaporean_history&oldid=911794433 reason] for inclusion is 'the template does not just include the history of the country of China, but also many related areas and topics - Singapore is today majority ethnically Chinese and more than fits the bill for inclusion in the template'. However, I disagree on the grounds that:
#Singapore is not a Chinese country or territory. The template is overwhelming China centric. Singapore is independent of China.
#If is to be included, it should be included as diaspora, and list with other countries with sizeable diaspora (i.e. USA) as well.
Even though Singapore has a large Chinese diaspora, Singapore has been separately managed and governed from China, even in ancient times. Whatever bearings China has on us would only be culturally and economically as international trade partners. Our political system, and societal structure, values are different. There were also relatively little events intertwining both nations. 
I seek consensus on whether to include Singapore in the above template. I don't think I would be able to resolve this with {{u|Qiushufang}} as looking at both our edit histories, we may end up clashing with each other over this.

[[User:ViperSnake151|ViperSnake151]], while almost certainly operating with good intentions and ''good faith'', has performed one or more [[WP:BRD]] moves of [[Bell Media Radio]] to [[IHeartRadio Canada]] with a rationale that is questionable and possibly inconsistent with one or more ''Wikipedia'' policies. He purportedly cites, by way of ''edit summaries'', CRTC ownership charts, but even that shows [[Bell Media]] and [[Bell Media Radio]] are the [[WP:CommonName]]. Moreover, looking to the company's own website, https://www.bellmedia.ca/radio/, I don't see how we should be using IHeartRadio Canada, notwithstanding the noted capitalization issues in that page name. Additionally, we also need to consider that iHeartRadio in the [[United States]] is a separate company owner separate ownership.

To me, I think the page names should remain [[Bell Media]] and [[Bell Media Radio]], with the ''lede'' and ''opening sentence'' indicating the legal name, '''Bell Media Radio G.P.'', and the [[doing business as]] name indicated as iHeartRadio, if desired.

I'd name it '''([country or area] TV provider)'''; since some companies do provide more than one method to provide multichannel services under the same brand (for example, [[Foxtel]] in Australia [cable and satellite], [[Telefónica]]'s [[Movistar+]] in Spain [IPTV and satellite], [[StarTimes]] operations in Africa [DTT and satellite] and [[Altice Dominicana S.A.|Altice Dominicana]] [cable and satellite]), it would be too much to have '''(cable TV provider)''', '''(satellite TV provider)''', '''(IPTV provider)''', etc..

Additionally, I'd suggest '''(radio provider)''' suffix for [[cable radio]] and [[satellite radio]] providers.

But what about services like [[Music Choice]] and [[Stingray Music]] that provide non-stop music streams to TV providers? Should they be suffixed with '''(audio service)'''?

Also, what about '''(video service)''' for
* [[Over-the-top media services|OTT]] video streaming services without linear live channels (like [[Netflix]])
* Video libraries that does not have streaming platform on its own, but provide a catalogue of VOD titles to TV providers (like [http://www.cirkustv.com/ Cirkus] and [http://www.curioplay.com/ Curio])

{{rfcquote|text=
I'm issuing this RfC re: some issues I noticed with this ''Wikipedia'' page. Specifically, its ''Holdings'' section where it notes, incorrectly based on my interpretation, that Witting Investments, Limited (Canada) is a [[subsidiary]] of Witting Investments Limited (United Kingdom). Based on the response to the third question in this [[FAQ]],<ref>{{cite web |title=FAQs |url=https://www.wittington-investments.co.uk/faq/ |website=Wittington Investments Limited |accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref>, it seems to indicate a ''very subtle'' difference in naming convention in that the UK-incorporated Wittington Investments ''doesn't'' have a comma following "Investments" whereas the Canada-incorporated Wittington Investments ''does''.

So, several questions:

# Am I correct in my interpretation that the UK-incorporated Wittington is ''not'' the parent company of the Canadian-incorporated Wittington?
# Assuming that the answer to Q. 1 is ''yes'', would it be logical, therefore, for me to initiate a ''move request'' to ''Wittington Investments (United Kingdom)'' or could I initiate this myself, intending to more fully develop an article for the Canadian-incorporated Wittington as a non-controversial ''page move'' (under what basis should I rationalize the move, as I'm unfamiliar with ''Wikipedia'''s labyrinth of policies)? What is the naming convention on ''Wikipedia'' for two companies that share the same name but different jurisdictions?
# Assuming I ''can'' do this myself non-controversially, or if I should do it in a ''page move'', will anyone volunteer to be a non-involved ''closer'' in either case? [[User:Dmehus|Doug Mehus]] ([[User talk:Dmehus|talk]]) 16:17, 27 August 2019 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
For many years, the requirement for a music album to be included in the article "[[List of music considered the worst]]" has been that there must be at least one source that calls the album, "the worst". While many albums considered bad are correctly included in this list with this unique requirement, many others which have a mixed or positive reception are also included, since at some point a critic called it "the worst", contradicting the general reception of the album.

We propose that the inclusion criteria changes, per the following:

#If an album contains a Metacritic score (being the original, remastered or new remix version), it has a score below 40, and at least three reliable sources call it "the worst", then it can be included in this article.
#If the album does not contain a Metacritic score, then a discussion will be made to review sources from [[WP:ALBUM]]. If >= 70% of the sources have a negative review of the album, and at least three of them call it "the worst", then it can be included in this article. 
#If an album does not meet any of these requirements, and it's currently in this article (in any section of it), then it will be removed from the article, because it's understood that it is not considered to be "the worst", which is the title of this article.

The question is, should a section about state-equivalents be included in the U.S. states article? The U.S. Census Bureau defines 6 state-equivalents: [[American Samoa]], the [[District of Columbia]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]. Even though these areas are not U.S. states, they are treated as though they are states (for statistical purposes) by the U.S. Census Bureau, and by other federal agencies of the United States (such as the U.S. Postal Service). Those opposing inclusion of these entities argue that they are not relevant to the article, while those in favor say they are relevant. There is a previous discussion about this issue in the section above (the section entitled, "Reverted state-equivalents section"). 02:17, 1 September 2019 (UTC)}}

Myself and {{ping|Davey2010}} have [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Davey2010#%22Full_parameters_are_always_preferred%22 come to a disagreement] as to whether a wikidata tracked template (such as [[Template:IMDB name]], [[Template:Official website]], [[Template:Twitter]] ...) should include the id and title, if these parameters are stored in wikidata. It turns out a lot of our individual edits have involved adding these when missing, or removing them when not needed(or moving them into wikidata) respectively. What's the preferred/consensus usage? ''[[Highlander (film)|#ThereCanOnlyBeOne]]''

:'''REWORDING''' using [[User:RexxS]]'s wording from below.
:in edits like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emily_Atack&diff=913323684&oldid=912719726 this], I changed <code><nowiki>{{Twitter|EmAtack}}</nowiki></code> to <code><nowiki>{{Twitter}}</nowiki></code> and <code><nowiki>{{IMDb name|3038143|Emily Atack}}</nowiki></code> to <code><nowiki>{{IMDb name}}</nowiki></code> because in those templates the values will be retrieved from Wikidata and we don't need to explicitly give the parameters in that article. Whereas in edits like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emily_Atack&diff=913325248&oldid=913323684 this], Davey2010 is restoring or adding those parameters explicitly, either because no valid reason was given for the removal, or because "Full parameters are always preferred". So we would like clarity on whether (1) it's better to keep simple facts centrally on Wikidata and retrieve them as needed; or (2) it's better to keep all information on Wikipedia where it is under our direct control.[[User:Bogger|Bogger]] ([[User talk:Bogger|talk]]) 21:19, 2 September 2019 (UTC)}}

Until about a week ago, this page described TERFs as {{tq|feminists who espouse transphobic sentiments}}. This was recently changed to {{tq|feminists who espouse sentiments considered transphobic}} by [[User:Crossroads1]], and through some talk page discussion has since become {{tq|feminists who espouse sentiments that other feminists consider transphobic}}, but we're now at an impasse.

There has been dispute on this talk page about how exactly to phrase this, with debate centering around the following options:

* '''Option 1''': Leave as is: {{tq|feminists who espouse sentiments that other feminists consider transphobic}}
*: '''Option 1.1''': Proposed by [[User:Darryl Kerrigan | Darryl Kerrigan]]: {{tq|feminists who espouse sentiments that others consider transphobic}}
* '''Option 2''': List specific sources: {{tq|  feminists who have been described as transphobic by USA Today, the Daily Dot, Indy100, and a joint statement by several major lesbian publications, as well as many other feminists}}
* '''Option 3''': Remove mention of transphobia entirely.
*:'''Option 3.1''': Proposed by {{u|Rosguill}}: remove mention of transphobia from the first paragraph but add it to the second which already describes criticism from feminists and academics {{tq|…have rejected this view and consider it to be transphobic}}
* '''Option 4''': Revert to previous wording with no in-text attribution: {{tq| feminists who espouse transphobic sentiments}}

VisualEditor has a particularly devilish bug that is snagging newbies and experts alike, and impacting a dozen+ articles a day.
:[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=See_of_Tyre&type=revision&diff=912533078&oldid=912532691 Example diff] from [[See of Tyre]]
Note the <code><nowiki><sup>[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tyre#cite%20note-FOOTNOTEHamilton2016409-13|[13]]]</sup></nowiki></code>. This should be cite #13 from the article [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tyre]] as of the date the revision at [[See of Tyre]] was made. When the editor copy-pasted the citation in non-edit mode, it got transformed into this garbage string. Another interpreted available [[User:GreenC_bot/Job_18|here]].

A couple things about this bug:
* It is unknown when the VE team will fix this bug. 
* It impacts not only citations: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elena_Bajo&diff=prev&oldid=913990745 example cleanup edit]
* A log of cases is available [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:AbuseLog&wpSearchFilter=861 here]
* I wrote a bot [[User:GreenC_bot/Job_18|vebug bot]] to "fix" these cases as seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rafael_Yuste&diff=prev&oldid=913904576 here]. 
* The bot is not fail-proof or fully automatic, there are ways for things to go wrong due to subtle complexities with revision histories, syntax of the bug, technical limitations of determining a citation by its number, etc. Thus the bot leaves a {{tlx|verify source}} with inline instructions for editors to manual check/fix the cite. It moves the process forward, but is not a total resolution. Only manual work can fully verify.

'''Proposal''': The RfC is to establish consensus for a new Edit filter to block further edits containing the bug. The block will contain a message instructing editors not to copy-paste wikitext text unless in edit-mode due to a bug in VisualEditor.  -- [[User:GreenC|<span style="color: #006A4E;">'''Green'''</span>]][[User talk:GreenC|<span style="color: #093;">'''C'''</span>]] 23:58, 3 September 2019 (UTC)}}

Friends, supporters, opposers, discussers, I'm aware of my oppose and how it has affected the RfA. My oppose remains the same. I am not comfortable handing this candidate the admin bit until the COI lines are drawn clear. Along the way, there are other significantly stronger oppose reasonings provided by my fellow editors.

And there are as strong, if not stronger, support reasonings, growing in number by the hour.

With all good faith and keeping the candidate's interests in mind, I propose this time-limited RfC for just this RfA (that is, any consensus reached/not reached below will apply just to this RfA and not to future RfAs):
::*'''that crats be allowed to extend this RfA by 24 hours at their discretion;
::*'''that this discretion will not be considered a bureaucratic overreach;
::*'''that any crat will retain the independence to close this RfA at any time after 7 days of !voting are over, irrespective of whether 24 hours extension has been allowed or not.'''

Having "anti-immigration" in the infobox when the party wants to allow 150 000 immigrants per year is deeply intellectually dishonest.
The PPC is anti-mass immigration, here's a source: https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/third-party-buys-billboard-to-promote-berniers-anti-mass-immigration-stance
You want to slander the party that's fine but at least try to show some intellectual honesty while doing it.  

Exactly, the PPC is not " anti-immigrant", wikipedia is infected with woke leftists parasites.

Can someone stop Helper201 from vandalizing the page?  

:This is how reliable sources have referred to the party. The linked page for anti-immigration links to the page [[opposition to immigration]], which states in its introduction - 

:'Opposition to immigration ranges from calls for various immigration reforms to proposals to completely restrict immigration to one's nation; these often also include measures to combat immigration of existing citizens'. 

:The party seems to conform at least in part with that description, so the linked page is apt to use here. I'm open to possibly changing what is stated in the infobox to 'anti-mass immigration', however this would likely fall under [[WP:SYNTH]] as this is not what the sources given state. We would need to find sources that state this explicitly, and preferably a third party source stating this, not just a quote from the party leader. I make sure to take a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral]] point of view in my editing and edit pages from across the political spectrum. I am simply adding cited information that is stated by reliable sources. Statements such as 'wikipedia is infected with woke leftists parasites' display a clear point of view.

{{rfcquote|text=
At the core of the definition of peer-to-peer systems is that there is '''no central stakeholder with power over the platform''', but instead '''peers''' directly coordinate and share resources. For instance, on the wiki page "Peer-to-peer"<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer</ref> it says: '''"Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application."'''

This is in complete contrast to how Uber operates: there is one stakeholder - namely Uber - who has almost full command over the platform. It is thus - by orders of magnitude - more privileged and potent than any single rider or driver (or even groups up to a certain size): Uber sets the prices, Uber, if they want, can without problem throw any single rider or driver out of the system, etc. Uber is a classical example of the "gig economy" <ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1024258916687250</ref>. 

Therefore I propose to remove the term "peer-to-peer" from the introduction. Instead it should simply be described as a ridesharing company<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridesharing_company</ref> which provides ride hailing services etc. (as already mentioned in the current intro) - don't you agree?

{{rfcquote|text=
This issue has to do with the sorting of surnames that are preceded by prefixes known as particles, such as ''de'' or ''von''.  The rules for sorting of surnames are complex and depend on the customs of the nationality.  The question is whether names should be sorted based on the national origin of the surname, or the nationality of the person.  An example is Luann de Lesseps, an American socialite and reality TV personality, whose surname is that of her French nobleman husband.  Should she be alphabetized as:
'''A'''.  de Lesseps, Luann (nationality of person, American)  
or
'''B'''.  Lesseps, Luann de (national origin of name, French)
or
'''C'''.  It depends.  If so, specify what it depends on.

Enter your !votes with a brief statement as '''A''' or '''B'''.  Enter any back-and-forth comments in the Threaded Discussion.

Regarding [[User:ThecentreCZ|ThecentreCZ]]'s nonsensical rejection of updating the logo. 

Directly from Wikipedia's policy on non-free logos:  "It is believed that the use of low-resolution images on the English-language Wikipedia, hosted on servers in the United States by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation, of logos for certain uses involving identification and critical commentary may qualify as fair use under the Copyright law of the United States." I did not make up that non-free logos should be low res you are simply just ignorant on the topic.

The logo that I believe is more suitable for the article is the logo featured multiple times in images on the front page of the SPD's website, the logo used on the SPD's official Facebook page and twitter profile, it is the logo used on posters and billboards and finally used at party events. Your version has less use and so I see no reason for why you are so opposed to the updating of the logo.[[User:Ec1801011|Ec1801011]] ([[User talk:Ec1801011|talk]]) 17:05, 16 September 2019 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Hirohito was officially subordinate to the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]] from the [[surrender of Japan]] on 2 September 1945 until the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] came into effect on 28 April 1952. The allies had official sovereignty over the former japanese territory ("occupied Japan") for that period. Furthermore, *as already discussed* it's clear that Hirohito was not a "sovereign monarch" by the 1947 constitution, and perhaps not officially a head of state at all.

Therefore I propose moving Hirohito to the second list of those who were "'''not fully sovereign over their territory for at least part of their reign'''" and adding an appropriate mention about the occupation to the note.

If disagreeing, please explain how Hirohito was a "sovereign monarch" "fully sovereign over their territory" after 2 September 1945 all the way to 1989.

The question is which languages should be included in topics related to Islamic law and Islamic concepts, particularly in regards to literature about Islamic systems or Islamic-inspired systems in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Should the articles:
* Only include Arabic names for terminologies and not include any other languages
* Also include names of terms in Ottoman Turkish, of the Ottoman Empire, which held Mecca until around World War I
* Include names in other languages commonly used in the Islamic world

Arguments in favor of only having Arabic: Wikipedia is NOT a dictionary, and the topic is not related to any particular country.

Arguments in favor of having other languages: The information would help users understand older English documents (circa late 1800s/early 1910s) using Turkish words (instead of Arabic ones), and that Wikipedia articles like [[qi]] already display terminologies of other languages.

Hi all. Pinging {{reply to|Dekai Averett}} {{reply to|64.57.49.68}} {{reply to|Mashaunix}}, all who have discussed this issue previously.

Idles clearly describe themselves as *not* a punk band. However many third parties would indeed label their music as such. I'm quite tired of seeing edits to this page back and forth between the two perspectives.

Can we please discuss and agree what the media consensus says their 'genre' is for the infobox?

I'd like to avoid further rollback wars between editors, so for now I'll leave the band as 'Punk rock' as per the most recent settled edit, and leave a warning to all users in the code - it is best to discuss the article here rather than getting into further edit disputes.

Please vote below whether
* Yes - stating what you think the consensus for their genre is, based on media sources
* No you think the band's interpretation should be used

{{rfcquote|text=
I would like to suggest including three more examples of local names for watercourses (X Brook, Afon X and Nant X). 'Brook' is a common name for a stream in the West Midlands which does appear in Ordnance Survey maps of the area e.g. [[Rea Brook]] in Shropshire. As for 'Afon' and 'Nant' they are the Welsh words for 'river' and 'stream' respectively and are also used in OS maps of Wales often without an English equivalent. I decided to start this discussion after noticing some articles about rivers in Wales use the Welsh prefix 'Afon' in their titles particularly for the smaller lesser-known rivers e.g. [[Afon Rheidol]] and [[Afon Dulas]] although this is the English-language Wikipedia. I am however unsure of the formality, as opposed to colloquialism, of the use of 'afon' in English. The most formal example of the 'Afon' prefix in English I have found is in a video from Natural Resources Wales in the [[River Dyfi]] article. I had started discussions on moving the [[Afon Twymyn]] and [[Afon Rheidol]] articles but both times it was decided not to move those articles and the opponents of the proposals argue that the use of 'Afon X' is normal locally. The article [[Welsh English]] describes at least four dialects of English within Wales (North Wales, Cardiff, South Wales Valleys and West Wales). According to the [[Anglicisation]] article the preference for Welsh place names over similar-sounding anglicisations is more common in the west of Wales so the same might be true for the 'Afon' prefix. As for 'Nant X' I have seen it used in OS maps and on local signs for streams in Wales e.g. Nant Gwernol, [[Nant Brân]] and [[Nant Ceiswyn]] without an English name of any kind.

Certain sources [https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/conspiracy-theorists-far-right-agitators-head-white-house-social-media-n1028576 1] [https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-praises-right-wing-conspiracy-theorists-at-white-house-the-crap-you-think-of-is-unbelievable 2] [https://deadline.com/2019/07/donald-trump-social-media-summit-elizabeth-warren-stable-genius-1202644883/ 3] [https://newrepublic.com/article/154467/trump-social-media-summit-assembles-gang-deplorables 4] mention Tim Pool as a conspiracy theorist, either in passing or as part of a list of others.  At least one source also includes a refutation from Pool, stating that he did not promote the conspiracy theory, although he did mention it and said he needed further evidence about it.  [[WP:CONTEXTMATTERS]] States that " Information provided in passing by an otherwise reliable source that is not related to the principal topics of the publication may not be reliable; editors should cite sources focused on the topic at hand where possible."  We disagree on whether these sources, while traditionally considered reliable by WP, are reliable in this case, as I think we ''would'' agree here that common sense shows Pool did not actually promote the theory as really true.  We also disagree on how notable for inclusion the sources are relative to Pool's biography.  And we would like clarification as to whether it is appropriate per the special protections in [[WP:BLP]] to include accusations which are mentioned by the sources in passing and have been denied by the subject.  We are also in need of clarification as to whether ''if'' we include a sentence stating that Pool has been accused of promoting a conspiracy theory, whether we should also state that he denies the charge (per one of the secondary sources and his own statements).

The article currently states that in late 1966, the Beatles became the first "entertainment act" in history to give up concert touring in order to focus on studio-recorded efforts. However, it is widely known that [[Brian Wilson]] of the Beach Boys made the same career decision more than a year earlier.

So, after looking at this page, I see that some of the prose on here is identical to the prose on the 2019 Canadian federal election page. The prose was added there by consensus when we wanted to put that page in the ''In the News'' section of Wikipedia. I'm also planning on adding an analysis section and election aftermath section to the [[2019 Canadian federal election]] page. In fact, some of the prose in the results section can fit in the former. And the latter needs to be added due to some ramifications the election has had already. We've also had an election aftermath section in previous elections, so that will probably need to be added anyways.

To continue, I was looking at other elections for other countries like the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|UK 2017 general election]] and I saw that it separated prose and and tables. However, in the past for Canadian elections the prose was in a separate article like this one (the Results page). But, that doesn't seem practical to me. So, I was wondering if we should separate the prose and the tables. The prose/analysis should be on the 2019 Canadian election page since we already reached consensus that there should be prose there and the tables should be on this page. If we don't solve it, we'll have two repetitive pages. A preview of what I am proposing can be seen when we look at the UK pages : [[Results_breakdown_of_the_2017_United_Kingdom_general_election]]
[[Results_of_the_2017_United_Kingdom_general_election]] 
''Edit: I need to add that I'm in favor of keeping simple tables on the main page but moving the more detailed stuff here. ''

It's a question of consistency vs practicality. Although, if we do the changes that I propose, we can simply go back to previous Canadian elections and make the changes there as well. -- [[User:MikkelJSmith|MikkelJSmith]] ([[User talk:MikkelJSmith|talk]]) 15:04, 29 October 2019 (UTC)}}

There has been a lot of discussion about whether AfC and NPP rights should be merged or kept separate. This RfC is an attempt to gauge the community consensus on the relationship between these rights. What should the relationship between [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Participants|permissions for Articles for Creation]] and [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/New page reviewer|New Page Patroller]] be?
*'''Option 1''' Merge these two rights - the work is similar and share an interface, so editors should have similar experience and capabilities. Someone with one right should be fully capable of performing the tasks of the other right. The details of how this merge would happen should be worked out in subsequent discussion.
*'''Option 2''' Keep separate - Because AfC reviews are routinely checked by new page patrollers, AfC may be granted to editors who are missing some experience or capability expected of new page patrollers 
*'''Option 3''' Keep separate - The experience and capabilities needed for each right are different and so the permissions are not comparable

* G1, A1 → G15 - Pages lacking a clear subject
* F1, A10, T3 → G16 - Redundant
* A3, F2, C1, G14 → G17 - No content

''' Merges into already existing criteria '''

* F9 - Unambiguous copyright infringement → G12 - Unambiguous copyright infringement
* U1 - User Request → G7 - Author requests deletion

In the meantime I deleted this section, as no counter-argument has been presented. (It does not make sense to retitle this section 'Departure from Traditional Buddhism' in my opinion, since he teaches only the ngondro of the 9th Karmapa, and Mahamudra teachings from Tilopa, the third Karmapa and Lama Zhang. These are all very traditional teachings. I see no evidence to indicate teachings that are in any way a departure from traditional Karma Kagyu Buddhism.

 There is a debate about whether announcements of future vehicles is worthwhile to put on WP or not.

This RFC is asking:
#Should announcements by company representatives for near future vehicles be reported on WP?<br>How about for magazine speculation?
#If allowed, how much detail should be reported?
#How much should we highlight the changeable nature of the forecast?
#Does [[WP:CRYSTALBALL]] apply to sections within articles? See clauses 1 and 5.
This discussion is meant to apply to the automobile project as a whole, not just to this M3 discussion that started it.<span style="border:1px solid blue;border-radius:4px;color:blue;box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px grey;">[[User:Stepho-wrs|'''&nbsp;Stepho&nbsp;''']]&nbsp;<span style="font-size:xx-small; vertical-align:top">[[User Talk:Stepho-wrs|talk]]&nbsp;</span></span> 00:42, 6 October 2019 (UTC)}}

I have observed that several administrators have started treating pages that have been nominated or deleted under CSD:G13 (Stale Drafts and submissions) to be summarily restored citing a finding that because the last XfD was a Keep (or no consensus) CSD:G13 is invalid on the page until a XfD results in a delete.  I therefore propose the following modification to CSD:G13 to establish if there is a consensus for that interpretation.

Any pages that have not been edited by a human in six months found in:

Recognising that the "{{strong|I}}nternet" used to be, or still is a proper name, upper case {{strong|I}}nternet remains American English (with its usage  decreasing in American English). In other national varieties of English, {{strong|i}}nternet is much more common. [[Capitalization of Internet#Argument for proper noun usage|In the relevant article, we are unable to find a source for it being a proper name]].

{{rfcquote|text=
With the disputed page move to [[IHeartRadio Canada]] now reverted and out of the way, I will say that [[User:ViperSnake151]] raised an interesting point of the separate IHeartRadio streaming radio network affiliation. Looking at [[Template:Infobox radio station]], it seems like the '''Network''' parameter is for branding to which a group of stations belong (i.e., Virgin Radio). Could it also be used for a streaming radio network, or would '''Affiliation''' be better? I'm going to ping {{ping|Bearcat}} for his expertise on the matter and also issue an RfC to generate a discussion. I'm wondering if this could be a worthwhile project to add such a parameter to the [[Bell Media Radio]] station infoboxes? Also, separately, the parameter usage documentation is quite scant, so I'm not quite such what attributes can be used with each parameter (specifically, the two mentioned). Should we initiate a separate RfC on that template's Talk page?

This rfc is being opened to attract more discussion on the following subject and to gain consensus one way or the other:

The second sentence in the article currently reads:

<i>"These two verses have historically been interpreted by Jews and Christians as clear overall prohibitions against homosexual acts in general."</i>

I propose to insert word "Traditionalist" so that the sentence reads:

<i>"These two verses have historically been interpreted by <b>Traditionalist</b> Jews and Christians as clear overall prohibitions against homosexual acts in general."</i>

I propose to make this change because:

'''1.)''' Since not all Christians support this interpretation, it would make the wording more accurate, as the current wording, IMHO makes it look like ''all'' Christians support that interpretation. 

'''2.)''' There is no source being used to support the current sentence as it stands.

I have attempted to add the word "Traditionalist" once,  Roscelese doesn't support this and has removed it, as is her right.   We started a discussion, and so far it's been only her and I.  So I now welcome more eyes and hands to this discussion.   What do you think ?

This issue has to do with the sorting of surnames that are preceded by prefixes known as particles, such as ''de'' or ''von''.  The rules for sorting of surnames are complex and depend on the customs of the nationality.  The question is whether names should be sorted based on the national origin of the surname, or the nationality of the person.  An example is Luann de Lesseps, an American socialite and reality TV personality, whose surname is that of her French nobleman husband.  Should she be alphabetized as:
'''A'''.  de Lesseps, Luann (nationality of person, American)  
or
'''B'''.  Lesseps, Luann de (national origin of name, French)
or
'''C'''.  It depends.  If so, specify what it depends on.

The [[WP:AGF|good faith]] edit reversion by {{u|Toa Nidhiki05}} cannot stand because citation "Vaccine journal" contains '''no mention''' of Sharyl Attkisson. Indeed, the only mention of the reporter's name in the journal writer's article is in a blog post, which the journal writer cites. The article itself makes no mention of Ms. Attkisson. Thus, we have a [[WP:BLP]] violation. At ''minimum'', this cannot stand.

More broadly, the sourcing in this section needs to be discussed and rewritten, where appropriate, consistent with [[WP:BLP]].

Should this article detail allegations against the late Irvin Rockman that were subject to a Parliamentary inquiry that he: (1) financed drug importation; (2) engaged in witness intimidation leading to the suicide of a woman, Cassandra Ogdon, who was due to give evidence against him; (3) that the State Coroner in his report of Ogdon's death, found that Rockman had lied at the inquest; and (4) that following this, the National Crime Authority began assembling a criminal case against him, but it never proceeded due to other circumstances. The disputed content is found in this earlier version of the article: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irvin_Rockman&oldid=920683757]] The sources are the Parliamentary Report, two leading newspapers, and an investigative book.

The policy says that mainstream newspapers are reliable sources. How can we determine if some newspaper is mainstream? Should we explain the mainstreamness criteria?

Second question: are all newspapers by default considered mainstream unless the opposite is demonstrated, or ''vise versa'': those editors who add a newspaper article are expected to provide a proof that they are mainstream?

Should Venezuelan crisis-related articles use terms like 'pro-Maduro', and, if not, what alternatives can be used?
Some initial notes:
* The result of this discussion, and comments in it, may be used to make up a standing guideline for WikiProject Venezuela - to maintain consistency and abide with consensus through all related articles.
* I would suggest not using POV/NPOV arguments in regards the use of 'pro-Maduro' and similar - this is where the original cyclical debate came from, because it can be interpreted differently, and these arguments don't seem to sway anyone. Equally, of course, defending the terms as being neutral shouldn't be used an argument to keep them.
* Please keep in mind the unique situation of Venezuela; it is almost impossible to compare with any other country.
* This discussion also includes use of 'pro-Guaidó' and 'pro-government'.
* Please keep comments and replies coherent, using appropriate indents and third-level headers if necessary.

Per the edit requests by {{U|Goldsztajn}}, I've updated the sandbox version of this template to have two new parameters: {{para|full name}} and {{para|full name lang}}. Additionally, I have updated {{para|native name}} and {{para|native name lang}} to use {{tl|lang}} so that metadata on non-English scripts can be added. In most cases these changes should be non-breaking, but if existing transclusions use a non-ISO language code or use a language name not supported by {{tl|ISO 639 code-3}}, the template produces an error message. I believe the benefit of the metadata outweighs the harm of a few errors, but want to establish consensus before these changes are made.

We need to start a new consensus whether we can use the Russian Football Union logo or the Russian coat of arms in the infobox. There has been too much edit instability (probably be declared edit warring if so be) revolving around the use of the logo, with editors (including me) switching the coat of arms with the logo and vice-versa, and this has been going on forever. We should acknowledge two factors, one for each side:

* In https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Files_for_discussion/2016_September_2, a consensus by the administrators declared that the logo should only be used for the [[Russian Football Union]] article and only for this instance, with this reasoning here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Files_for_discussion/2016_September_2#File:Russian_Football_Union.png.
* In the summary of File:Russia national football team crest.svg, it is allowed to be in minimal use under [[WP:NFCC#3]], and the only article for such minimal use is the Russian national football team.

There is a much needed consensus or else there will be continual edit warring between not two users but multiple. For the consensus, state '''Support''' if you want to use the logo for the infobox image or '''Oppose''' if you want the coat of arms to remain as the primary infobox image. - [[User:Josephua|Josephua]] ([[User talk:Josephua|talk]]) 04:20, 18 October 2019 (UTC)}}

{{see also|Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Television/August 2016 updates/PSE image}}

With regards to this section of MOS:TVIMAGE:

{{quote|For a show's main article, an intertitle shot of the show (i.e., a screenshot capture of the show's title) or a promotional poster used to represent the show itself should be used.}}

I propose to replace it with:

{{quote|For a show's main article, '''the show's logo''',  a promotional '''image''' used to represent the show itself, or an intertitle shot of the show (i.e., a screenshot capture of the show's title), should be used. '''In such a case where the logo is free to use, it is preferred over non-free media.'''}}

My reasons for the proposal are thus:

*This would reflect current practice: see, for example, [[The Simpsons]], [[House (TV series)]], [[Sesame Street]], all FAs which use representative free-to-use logos instead of non-free intertitles. 
*Intertitles for use in infoboxes tend to have massive image compression problems to try to find a sweet spot with regards to passing NFCC, an issue that we can side-step with a free-to-use logo. 
**If free media can be found to represent a television show just as well as the intertitle, then [[WP:NFCCP#1]] implicitly fails for the intertitle. '''[[User:Sceptre|Sceptre]]''' ([[User talk:Sceptre|talk]]) 20:56, 21 October 2019 (UTC)}}

After the House passed the Act, Beijing condemned the move and said it would take countermeasures.

It is not because I want to hide their opinions. But I think their opinions are somewhat too detailed. I believed that Chinese will actually do something and the reactions from Chinese government will be expanded. The format now is like “Chinese statement-analysis-Chinese statement-analysis”, which may be harmful to readlity. I have suggested serveal solutions:

Although most of the article is stable, the subsections on the current president and to a lesser extent the previous president are targets of nearly all edits. The vast majority of these edits are reverted as they are based on what one commentator or comedian called a president and are unlikely to stand the test of time. Should we change the scope of the article as follows:

*'''Option A''' – Leave as is.
*'''Option B''' – Remove the current president and move to ''List of nicknames of past presidents of the United States''.
*'''Option C''' – Remove the current president and previous president (e.g. Trump and Obama) and move.
*'''Option D''' – Remove modern era presidents. Please specify where to draw the line.

{{rfcquote|text=
This article exhibits clear bias on the part of supporters of Bernie Sanders, as evidenced by the talk page and the content of the article itself. The main article for Bernie Sanders already contains a section dedicated to how he / his campaigns have been covered by news outlets. This page has no reason to exist other than to satisfy the agenda of Sanders supporters. 

Bernie Sanders receives a good deal of news coverage, and the coverage he gets tends to be somewhat positive. His supporters have created this article to abuse the clout of Wikipedia and justify their narrative that Sanders's current standing in the polls is due to outside forces rather than simply having less support than his opponents. The existence of a separate article also allows them to avoid the higher scrutiny they would face when editing the main article for Bernie Sanders. In addition, this seems to be the only page on the entirety of Wikipedia dedicated to the media bias against a single person. 

It is for these reasons that I believe this page should either be removed entirely, rolled into an existing section of the main Bernie Sanders article, or added as a new section of the main Bernie Sanders article. At the very least this article should be held to the same standard as any other political article, as political subjects are very easily affected by bias.

I apologize for any misuse of the Wikipedia editing process. I don't have any experience with this community, but had to speak out against what I feel is a clear abuse of the platform.

We sometimes use "on" for islands and other landforms for categories such as [[:Category:Villages on Jura, Scotland]] and [[:Category:Villages on the Isle of Mull]] and sometimes use "in" such as [[:Category:Villages in Islay]] and [[:Category:Villages in the Isle of Arran]].

Given the problems with the last one I'll start a brief one based on above with the "inhabited or previously inhabited".

*Always use "on".
*Use "in" for one of those size types (and larger, please specify the size such as "very small" per above) but otherwise use "on".
*Use "in" for inhabited or previously inhabited.
*Always use "in".

Arguments in favour of distinguishing from inhabited include being more natural (especially to the people there). Arguments against include determening if an island is/was inhabited.

I believe that some recent good faith additions are unintentionally, but blatantly bias, and do not simply describe the subject but rather state as fact the negative attributes of those this term is used to denigrate. I also believe the citations used to do so are poor references for such bold claims, like suggesting that progressives are: 
:"pursuing personal validation in place of deep-seated conviction and engaging in disingenuous arguments." 
It reads as bias opinion and a misrepresentation of the source.
 
The same editor also added tangentially related topics (that might be appropriate in the see also section) to the lede claiming that: "It has been associated with being "woke" and call-out culture" they've added random quotes from Obama, Vice magazine contributors, some super obscure game etc. I feel like these and other recent edits are using POV language and drawing in as many negatives as possible rather than objectively describing the subject - a pejorative term used by detractors to describe progressives. 

I believe the language needs to be more neutral and reflect the sources, some claims are undue and/or based on low quality sources. What do other editors think?

Hi everyone,

The [[:Template:Canadian federal political parties]] uses the [[:Template:Canadian party colour]] template, per [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Political parties and politicians in Canada/list of parties#Senate-only caucuses]] documentation. This template uses the more generic [[:Template:Party shading/Independent]], [[:Template:Party shading/Liberal]], and [[:Template:Party shading/Conservative]] templates. So, I propose, for the purposes of simplicity, streamlining, and using the Canadian context, that we update this template's party colour shading template to [[:Template:Canadian party colour]] as outlined in the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Political parties and politicians in Canada/list of parties#Senate-only caucuses]] documentation.

{{rfcquote|text=
Today, two different IP editors have tried adding [[Liberalism]]/[[Conservatism]] and [[Liberal Conservatism]] to the [[List of political ideologies|Ideology]] attribute to the [[Canadian Senators Group]], ''without'' providing a citation saying that these ideologies were official ideologies of the [[parliamentary group|parliamentary caucus]] in the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]].

The first editor did not provide an edit summary. Finally, the second IP editor claimed, in their edit summary, that because ''some'' of the group's Senators ''may'' have supported legislation or proposed legislation supported by the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]], that that's enough to justify adding [[Liberal Conservatism]] or [[Conservatism]] as this group's ideology. I wholeheartedly disagree, so have reverted the edits, which I assume were in [[WP:AGF|good faith]], and have now initiated this [[WP:RFC|RFC]] to establish consensus that this was the correct approach. Otherwise, we'll have to start applying unofficial political ideologies to similar [[parliamentary group|parliamentary caucuses]] such the [[Independent Senators Group]].

[[Media Matters]] is '''not''' a [[WP:RS|reliable source]]; it is a biased [[Left-leaning|left-leaning]] propaganda website, funded by [[David Brock]]'s political action committee/politically-active non-profit conglomeration/empire. Alternatively, if there's a [[WP:RS|reliable source]], ideally two sources since it's a ''criticism'', that cites the same thing as [[Media Matters]] and which is '''not''' a [[WP:CIRCULAR|circular source reference]] that cites [[Media Matters]], I wouldn't be opposed to ''replacing'' the citation. But, ''as written'', this is a highly problematic citation.

Given the contentious nature of this show and the attention it attracts, I thought it prudent to establish this RfC to establish [[WP:CONSENSUS|consensus]] rather than editing out that sentence, only have to it be undone within days (if not sooner).--[[User:Dmehus|Doug Mehus]] ([[User talk:Dmehus|talk]]) 23:49, 7 November 2019 (UTC)}}

*{{tl|Uw-causeblock}}

Had a RL discussion yesterday about the message our blocking templates for [[WP:ORGNAME]] violations, and I think we may have hit on a real issue here. None of these templates mentions what we historically called the "Mark at Alcoa" exception, that is, adapting an orgname to an acceptable name by adding an unique identifier for an individual. 

What tends to happen now is that the user registers the organization name, (or the name of their PR agency working for that an organization) makes a draft or edits an article on that organization, and then gets blocked and told either it's because of their username or because of their username ''and'' spamming. The message they tend to get, whether intended or not, is "change your name and it's cool". And by the letter of our policy, this is true, at least for soft blocks. The issue is that if they go ahead and register a new, policy-compliant name, we no longer have that easy identifier that lets us know they have a [[WP:COI]] and/or are [[WP:PAID]]. This is not optimal. 

So what I'm suggesting is that we modify these templates to suggest they use the <name>@<organization> format. I'm not suggesting exact wording since every time I do that someone else has better wording, so I'll leave that to ya'll should we decide to do this. Thoughts?

Background: TV articles that need disambiguation can be disambiguated by the country adjective of the country the show originated from. So, as an example, if a show was broadcast in Mexico it would be <code>''TV series'' (Mexican TV series)</code>. Sub-divisions of a country are not used for disambiguating. Which means an article can be disambiguated as <code>''TV series'' (American TV series)</code> but not <code>''TV series'' (New York TV series)</code>; <code>''TV series'' (British TV series)</code>, but not <code>''TV series'' (Welsh TV series)</code>, <code>''TV series'' (Scottish TV series)</code> or <code>''TV series'' (Northern Ireland TV series)</code>.

The above discussion's input has the pre-1997 disambiguation for these articles at <code>''TV series'' (Hong Kong TV series)</code>. Should post-1997 TV articles about Hong Kong be disambiguated the same or use <code>''TV series'' (Chinese TV series)</code>. --[[User:Gonnym|Gonnym]] ([[User talk:Gonnym|talk]]) 17:20, 10 November 2019 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
In articles on Wikipedia about political subdivisions with territorial disputes, it is common to show both the de-jure and de-facto boundaries of a division (see below).

Following the bifurcation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, I was asked to make some [[:File:IN-JK_(2019).svg|new]] [[:File:IN-LH.svg|maps]] showing these new divisions.  These were then cited by {{u|Kautilya3}} in a [[Talk:Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)#Three_map_proposal|discussion]] as "a good solution for avoiding objections from readers". Consequent to this, {{u|Fowler&fowler}} self-judged that my maps were POV and removed them from all articles present.

The question is very simply to establish a common consensus across Wikipedia on whether territorial claims should, or should not be present in any articles about political subdivisions.

== Southern Poverty Law Center '''

I know this has come up before, but from what I can tell, it appears that the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] is okay as a reliable source in some situations. However, it is also well known that the SPLC has been criticized for labeling certain groups as hate groups that they appear to dislike, with some alleging that the labels are politically of economically motivated. However, I just wanted to make sure if it is okay to use two sources that appear (at least to me) to be legitimate instead of smears likely to be questioned. I used both of these sources at [[Rick Tyler (white supremacist)]] which is about a person who claims to not be a racist, but pretty much everyone else agrees that he is. 

*[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/american-freedom-party] - used to cite the [[American Freedom Party]] as "advocating for white nationalism."

*[https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/07/26/rick-tyler-tennessees-racist-third-congressional-district-candidate] - used to cite the fact that he was noticed by the SPLC and is a believer in [[Christian Identity]].

Sorry if this discussion inconveniences anyone. I just wanted to make sure if it is okay to use these sources and whether or not I should try to find a better source in substitute of the SPLC. Consensus seems to also show that we should not label every group that is classified as a hate group by the SPLC in the lead, if I am not mistaken.

A question has come to the fore as to whether Wikipedia policy permits us to add a broad definition of "Textus Receptus" to the lede paragraph, a phrase defined in the Random House Webster's College Dictionary as: "a text of a work that is generally accepted as being genuine or original [1855-60]." Some editors here have felt that since Wikipedia is not a dictionary, a broad definition of the term cannot be used, particularly since the article treats of ancient Greek Christian texts. The problem, however, is that other articles also make use of this term when referring to ancient Hebrew texts (e.g. [[Mikraot Gedolot#The Ben Hayyim edition|Mikraot Gedolot]], [[Masoretic Text#Critical study|Masoretic Text]], [[Damascus Pentateuch#History|Damascus Pentateuch]], and [[Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus scroll#Historical background|Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus scroll]]). As can be seen, the term "textus receptus" is used for ancient Hebrew manuscripts as well. What's more, they all link to the article "Textus Receptus"! Since the term is broadly used, should it be restricted only to Greek Christian texts? If we should give its broader definition in the lede, would it take away from the general scope of this article?[[User:Davidbena|Davidbena]] ([[User talk:Davidbena|talk]]) 16:01, 14 November 2019 (UTC)}}

*Prevent the creation of titles with any of the 4 following character strings:

One may argue it would now be legitimately fair and more accurate to describe the Conservative Party as far-right, as since 2019 they have openly espoused nationalist, nativist and authoritarian policies which would not be reasonably regarded as politically centric.  

:I agree that we should include the far-right descriptor, but probably as part of a spectrum, "right-wing to far-right," like we typically do in the articles on comparable parties with which the Conservative Party (UK) has had formal cooperation agreements at the European level, such as [[Alternative for Germany]] ("is a right-wing to far-right political party in Germany"). We already have a discussion on this above. The descriptor "centre-right", particularly when used as the only descriptor of the contemporary Johnson-led anti-immigrant party, is an obvious falsehood that comes close to propaganda. --[[User:Tataral|Tataral]] ([[User talk:Tataral|talk]]) 21:56, 13 December 2019 (UTC)}}

Source statement in this part of the article [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Ukrainian_War#Aftermath]: "After the war, in 1920-1921, Polish concentration camps held over one hundred thousand people. In many cases prisoners were denied food and medical attention. Some starved; others died of disease or committed suicide. Among the interned were Jews and others of other nationalities who supported Ukrainian independence, and Jews figured among the witnesses who described the murder and abuse."

Source: Myroslav Shkandrij. (2015) Ukrainian Nationalism: Politics, Ideology, and Literature, 1929-1956. New Haven: Yale University Press pg. 19

Article states: "After the war, in 1920-1921, approximately 100,000 Ukrainians, and Jews as well as people of other ethnicity who had supported Ukrainian independence, were placed in concentration camps by the Polish government, where they were often denied food and medicine; some of them died from starvation, disease or suicide."

One editor keeps removing the words "concentration camp" and references to Jews as being among the victims.

1.  Is this an accurate statement based on the source?   

2.  Should it be changed to remove reference to Jews and to remove the words "concentration camp."[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 14:41, 19 November 2019 (UTC)}}

"In a memorandum to the allies during the Paris Peace Conference, an official note written by [[Volodymyr Temnytsky]], foreign minister of the Ukrainian National Republic, and Joseph Burachynsky, justice minister included a partial list of crimes allegedly committed by Poles.  These alleged crimes included: that in the village of Yesupol near Halych sixteen Ukrainian peasants were hanged without a trial by Polish forces; that the peasant Jasko Bondar's eyes were gouged out by Polish soldiers because he refused to give them his last cow; that in Labye a widow and mother of seven children was hanged because a rifle had been found next to her house; that a twelve year old girl was raped by numerous Polish soldiers; and that near Sudova Vyshnia seven villages were burned down and their inhabitants killed.

Written by [[[[Volodymyr Temnytsky]]]], foreign minister, Ukrainian Republic, and Joseph Burachinsky, minister of justice of the Western territory of the Ukrainian Republic."

I believe this book [[The Coddling of the American Mind]] by [[Greg Lukianoff]] and [[Jonathan Haidt]] is given undue weight.

The book has a clear and strident bias, it is an ideologically driven work written from libertarian stance.

{{rfcquote|text=
In the spirit of the essay [[Wikipedia:Use modern language]], I propose standardizing on "it" for ships instead of "she". This would mean removing the gender-neutral language exception at [[MOS:GNL]] and the copies at [[WP:GNL#Ships]], [[WP:SHE4SHIPS]], and [[WP:SHIPPRONOUNS]]. Rationale:
* "She" for ships sounds "old-fashioned"[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/she][https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/she], or "quaint or poetic"[https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2010/12/ships.html].
* "She" for ships is uncommon and is becoming less common in the sources we cite.  It is not found in mainstream media, and even the nautical publication Lloyds List abandoned "she" two decades ago.[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1388373/Lloyds-List-sinks-the-tradition-of-calling-ships-she.html]
* "She" for ships is disrecommended by reputable usage authorities, including ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', ''[[The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage]]'', ''[[The Associated Press Stylebook]]'', <s>and even the [https://www.navy.mil/submit/navyStyleGuide.pdf U.S. Navy style guide], which includes the AP Stylebook by reference.</s>
* "She" for ships is confusing, especially for readers with English as a second language.  It violates the general English rule that inanimate objects are referred to by "it" because English has no [[grammatical gender]]. It is even more confusing when referring to ships with masculine names (like the [[USS John McCain]]).
* "It" for ships is already an accepted Wikipedia style and does not have any of these disadvantages.

Finally, my questions: 

Yes, as detailed above, head-to-head records are tricky when it comes to the NHL. Yes, as detailed above, they’re made harder by editors purposely pushing a misrepresentation of facts. Again, purposely. That said, should the Islanders-Rangers rivalry record be a singular "W-L-T" format as seen in most other Wikipedia head-to-head rivalry records? Should two separate “W-L-T-OTL” records (one for the Rangers and one for the Islanders) be listed instead? Or should we just stick with the "W-L-T-OT/SO-L but only for the Rangers and not for the Islanders” disingenuous format being advanced by both Sabbatino and GoodDay?

Background: In [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADid_you_know&diff=prev&oldid=108361465 February 2007], before we had our 200-character limit, ‘shorter hooks are preferred' was added to [[WP:DYKHOOK]]

In December of 2007, length restrictions were codified to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADid_you_know&diff=prev&oldid=180825844 a 200 character max.]  

In current practice, within our 200-character limit, we don't seem to actually favor shorter hooks over longer hooks. We tend to prefer ''good'' hooks, which sometimes translates to shorter and sometimes requires longer. For the sake of main page balance, we need a variety of hook lengths. However, we had a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Did_you_know/Archive_163#Template:Did_you_know_nominations/Farthing_Pie_House recent argument] about a problematic short hook being replaced with a longer, better hook in which the main reason for keeping the shorter hook was our ‘short hooks are preferred’ policy. My feeling at the time was that 13-year-old policy stating a preference for short hooks was probably obsoleted 12 years ago when we adopted a length restriction, and that in current practice, a 197-character hook that is good is preferred over a 100-character hook that is not as good. I made a change, but it was reverted, so I asked this question [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Did_you_know/Archive_163#Discussing_change_to_WP:DYKHOOK a couple of weeks ago] but didn’t get much response, so I made a change, and Yoninah thinks we probably need an RfC.

And in the same table, it is said that 30 million Americans play basketball, surpassing the figure for baseball/softball (29M) and football (9M).

In the article it is said that "Certain teams of both sports...have cultivated famously loyal fan bases across the country." The same can be said of basketball teams: the [[Lakers]], [[Clippers]], [[Golden State Warriors|Warriors]] and others.

This section gives the impression of America as a two-sport nation, when it is really more of a three-sport nation. At the college level, football and (men's) basketball are by far the most popular sports. 

In addition, this entire section is based off a post on [[WrestleZone]] Forums, which isn't exactly a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] for this sort of information (especially since it is unrelated to wrestling). It is a forum, written by random people. The only other sources are a couple articles about the NFL's concussion problem and the "best fanbases" in the NFL. No reliable sources relating to baseball.

Should we delete the entire section, or expand it to include basketball and reliable sources? [[User:Sanjay7373|Sanjay7373]] ([[User talk:Sanjay7373|talk]]) 05:47, 25 November 2019 (UTC)}}

A discussion that has been taking place for quite some time, and that had been nearly settled - originally on the "right-libertarian" talk page, and now on this discussion site - has stalled due to two editors (one of which was recently banned from editing - no doubt for similar conduct). It involves the confusing use of the term "right-libertarian" to describe an ideology that is admittedly not identified with the political right. Self-described "left-libertarians" have a nuanced definition of "capitalism" that distinguishes it from the "free-market" with which the group in question identifies. The "right-libertarian" page was to be renamed with a term that is more understandable, and this page was to incorporate a clarification of the usage of the term.

There is currently a dispute over whether facts about demographic change in majority white countries, such as the fact that the United States is projected to be minority white by 2045, should be included on this page. There are several sources relating to the topic that mention demographic change as a major part of the belief. The words "demographic", "demographics", and "demographic change" appear ten separate times in this article in direct relation to the idea of white genocide. However, no details on these demographics or demographic change are given whatsoever. '''Should this article include any details about demographic changes in majority white countries?'''

It seems {{u|Kierzek}} [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Allgemeine-SS&oldid=prev&diff=928814147 objects] to making associations to [[Nazi Germany]] more evident in headings of templates in this category. Did we run out of ink or something? Or did we suddenly reach a point of perfect education on [[Nazi Germany]] so that all people around the world naturally knows that military unit X and Y is associated with the historical [[Nazi Germany]] and not any other entity, former or subsequent?
