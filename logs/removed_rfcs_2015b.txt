Initially this page had figures taken only from the Brookings Institution report "Global Metro Monitor An Uncertain Recovery 2014". Currently in dispute is whether an alternative source for Bangalore should be used in place of the Brookings figure. Options to resolve the dispute could be:
: 1. ''Allow'' sources for individual cities.
: 2. ''Restrict'' sources to comparative studies covering many cities.
: 3. ''Delete'' this page, as it's too contentious and actually of little use.

{{rfcquote|text=
This dispute is about notability and reliable sourcing. User [[User:Xinheart|Xinheart]] wants to add the following paragraph to the section explaining the origin of the names Gog and Magog:

<blockquote>
In his 1945 book "The Reign of Quantity and The Sign of Times" metaphysician author René Guénon has a full chapter on the subject of Gog and Magog ("The fissures of the great wall"). Gog and Magog are related to their Hindu counterpart called demon brothers Koka and Vikoka "whose names are obviously similar", and refer symbolically, according to Guénon, not to groups of people on earth, but to entities belonging to the "subtle world" and having an existence presently hidden from the human realm and symbolically described as subterranean.</blockquote>

The problems with this are:

* The idea that the names Gog and Magog are related to the names of the two Hindu demons Koka and Vikoka never appears in any of the sources listed in our bibliography - there must be thirty or so books there, and it's not mentioned once, whether in the text or the footnotes. This is not a notable idea.

* [[René Guénon]] is not a biblical scholar - as his biography shows, he never acquired any formal training in the disciples that biblical scholars need (Hebrew language, various other languages, various forms of criticism, etc), never held any academic position connected with biblical studies, and never published in the relevant journals nor had any books reviewed in those journals (at least so far as I can tell). Nor is he ever mentioned in the books in the bibliography. He is not a reliable source.

* The idea that Gog and Magog, or for that matter Koka and Vikoka, are "entities belonging to the subtle world," "hidden from the human realm," and "symbolically described as subterranean" is somewhere between incomprehensible and plain wacky. It has no place in a serious encyclopedia. Needless to say it never appears in reliable sources. [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 02:22, 8 July 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Some disputes when editing an article involve discussions as to whether material should be covered at all because after some discussion editors fail to agree as to whether it is relevant or notable.  In these situations editors should attempt to classify the material as being in the following classes:-

# Essential content
# Non-essential but valuable
# Superfluous but verifiable and not harmful or POV
# Clearly unhelpful, irrelevant and distracting

Editors will disagree on the classification of material, but usually only by one level in the above scheme.

In the first instance editors should remove any material they consider class 3 & 4.  But if that escalates into a dispute, then they should accept class 3 content, and trust the reader to determine its relevancy.  Class 4 material always needs to go.  But it is generally better to err on the side of leaving in some sub-optimal material than to remove useful content.

Note that this does not refer to the creation of new pages.

{{rfcquote|text=
We have a debate on how to describe a proposed political party in the United States, the Transhumanist Party, or whether it should be on Wikipedia at all. On one hand, some editors are claiming it is a real political party and should be described as such. On the other hand, some editors are claiming the party does not exist and the only mention of it should be on founder [[Zoltan Istvan]]'s page.  We all agree the party is recognized as a non-qualified party under the state of California based on this memo from the Elections Division,[http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ccrov/pdf/2015/march/15031da.pdf] but we can't agree further.  We also can't agree on whether the Transhumanist Party in the United Kingdom is a real thing or not.  What makes this difficult is that the founder of the party [[Zoltan Istvan]] is also a professional journalist and has been using his articles to puff up notability of the party, so separating real notability from puffery has been difficult. Another difficulty is that according to the official website the party is a non-profit but managed by the Transhumanist National Committee LLC., and LLC's are for profit.  The problem is that non-profit political parties are not traditionally managed by for-profit companies, so in a best-case scenario the Transhumanist Party may actually be a for-profit election committee doing grassroots lobbying for the development of a non-profit party or in a worst-case scenario a fake non-existent party, basically a scam.  There have been advocacy investigations on both sides related to this topic, including on myself, so neutral outside opinions would help. Thank you.

Several weeks ago a statement was added into the lede of this article which (in its current form) states that "Others have drawn comparisons between UKIP and far-right political parties such as the British National Party (BNP)." This is then cited to an article from ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper. There was never any consensus obtained to add this information into the lede, and many editors have objected to it, resulting in edit wars and administrative blocks on editing the entire page. Concerns have been raised that its inclusion in the lede constitutes [[Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Due_and_undue_weight|undue weight]] and that as such it compromises the NPOV nature of the article by seeking to over-emphasize the links between UKIP and a more extreme party. Those who support its inclusion dispute this viewpoint, deeming it to be due weight. A debate was held at [[Talk:UK Independence Party#Suggested removal of BNP comparison in the lede]] but it appears to have gone stale with no consensus so I was hoping that opening it up to other editors in an RfC would help bring us to a solution.

(5) Marx and Smith section, Verbatim: Both supply-siders and their opponents have been keen to claim the mantles

# [[WP:NEWSORG]] says that "Editorial commentary, analysis and opinion pieces, whether written by the editors of the publication (editorials) or outside authors (op-eds) are reliable primary sources for statements attributed to that editor or author, but are rarely reliable for statements of fact."

Number 3 seems to suggest there is a possibility the column is acceptable, since it's written by a journalist. Number 4 seems to suggest that is is a primary source for the author's opinion even if it is written by a journalist and would therefore be undue/a bad use of a primary source. <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:CorporateM|CorporateM]] ([[User talk:CorporateM|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/CorporateM|contribs]]) </span></small>

'''Discussion'''

*This has been addressed before, but CorporateM, a COI editor, can't accept that and keeps pushing the issue repetitively, in a nitpicky wikilawyering fashion, apparently until he gets the answer that satisfies him and Yelp. There is absolutely, positively, unequivocally ''nothing'' wrong with the text that is the subject of this totally unnecessary RfC. These are factual statements made by a notable journalist at a notable news organization. There is no evidence that the journalist in question, [[David Lazarus]], is on some kind of crusade against Yelp, or that the [[Los Angeles Times]] is for some reason not to be trusted and is simply mouthing off on Yelp. It is not a user-generated blog by any stretch of the imagination, and it is not an editorial or an opinion piece. It is the Los Angeles Times's business columnist reporting facts. Yelp, whose spokesman was quoted in this piece, doesn't like what the LA Times printed. Tough. There is absolutely zero reason to remove or change this text, but we keep on getting the insistence of a Yelp representative, CorporateM, that it has to go. 

:Up with this I am fed. Enough already. Put down the [[WP:STICK]], already. If you don't like what the LA Times business columnist reports about Yelp, take it up with the LA Times or its business columnist.

{{rfcquote|text=
I would like to get wider community input on a matter that is preventing an effort to improve wikipedia's coverage of the role played by Luis Vernet in the Falkland Islands.  There are two key areas I feel community input would be helpful:

1.  Luis Vernet had multiple dealings with the British and visited the British consulate on more than occasion.  He corresponded regularly with the British consul Woodbine Parish for a number of years.  We have one source Cawkell, definitely referring to a meeting in January 1828.  The second Shuttleworth also refers to a meeting but the date of the meeting is unclear in this account and the only date definitively given is to 1829 in reference to a scheme to form a penal colony.  It has been inferred from this that the date of the meeting must be 1829.  Both sources agree that Vernet had recognised the British sovereignty claim and requested British protection for Vernet's own settlement.  A corroborating factor is that Cawkell refers to the grant given to Vernet by the Government of Buenos Aires was raised in the meeting, which can also be dated to January 1828. We have one editor asserting there is a conflict between sources, insisting he changes the chronological order of the article.  He is moving the meeting with the consulate to after a later event when Vernet was appointed Military and Civil Commander in mid-1829, which is actually contradicted by the sources; the scheme referred to was suggested in early 1829.  Further he is insisting we must use attribution to infer that only Cawkell mentions Vernet's approaches to the British for endorsement of his venture.  This is an almost exact reprise of an earlier RFC [[Talk:History of the Falkland Islands/Archive 2#RfC: Did Vernet seek and obtain British permission before settling]].  Rather than actually dealing with and reporting on what sources say, the effort is focused on challenging their reliability and using attribution to infer doubt.

2.  The same editor has also challenged Cawkell's references to Vernet's correspondence with Lt Smith, first British residence, and that both Lt Smith and his son provided Vernet with regular accounts.   Again he asserted only Cawkell mentions this, I have obtained images of some of the original correspondence from the archives which confirms this exists.  One example is accounts provided by Lt Smith to Vernet, one example is Vernet writing to the British C in C praising Lt Smith's administration of his property and another a covering letter giving instructions to deal with the personal effects of the victims of the Gaucho murders.  This editor is now simply removing these alleging they clutter the article and demanding we still attribute this solely to Cawkell.  It is also relevant to note that Vernet's dealing with the British are referred to in Caillet-Bois - an Argentine source and the same editor has been using this source whilst insisting only Cawkell made reference to it.

Questions for wider community input:

# Noting there were multiple meetings between Vernet and Parish is there actually a conflict in the sources?
# Should the article contain some of the images of original correspondence?
# Should we attribute every single fact referenced from Cawkell?  <span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User:Wee Curry Monster|W]][[Special:contributions/Wee Curry Monster|C]][[User talk:Wee Curry Monster|M]]</span><sub>[[Special:EmailUser/Wee Curry Monster|email]]</sub> 16:49, 11 July 2015 (UTC)}}

'''Proposed merge''' of [[Demoscene compo]], [[Demoparty]], and [[List of demoparties]], after removal of unsourced material, to [[Demoscene]].  These have all be flagged for cleanup for years, and it's not happening, but one combined article might actually make it to B class or better. At very least, [[Demoscene compo]] and [[List of demoparties]] can merge, leaving two aticles, [[Demoscene]] and [[Demoparty]].  Demoparties are simply a subtopic of demoscene, and this article is not long enough (and after merge would still not be long enough) to require splitting per [[WP:SUMMARY]]. Even more so for compos; this isn't even really a proper subtopic, it's just mostly what demoparties are about.  The list of demoparties is short. If kept as a list, its difficult-to-edit table format should be replaced with normal list format. It would actually be better to reuse the material in chronological order, combined with the existing history material, to form four normal-paragraph blocks of history content (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s).  By way of analogy, this is mess is much like having an article on [[Drum and bass]] music, and then content-forking like mad to have separate articles on [[Drum and bass dancing at clubs]], [[Drum and bass clubs]], and [[List of drum and bass clubs]]. Dancing, and clubbing, and dance clubs as entities are all sourceable parts of drum-and-bass electronic music sub-subculture, but it's unhelpful to micro-fork articles in this way. It leads to [[WP:TRIVIA|trivial cruft]], and to unsourced, [[WP:COI]]/[[WP:POV]]/[[WP:OR]]-inflected edits, and to a fragmentary approach to coverage of the topic that makes it harder to understand for readers, and harder to maintain or improve for editors.<p>This proposal excludes demoscene-related articles that are on distinct topics, like software, specific notable demoparties as events, demogroups as art collectives, etc.  These four particular articles are simply increasingly nit-pickily forked, lagely-unsourced stubs on the demoscene as an organized subcultural activity, which is essentially a single topic.</p><p>PS: I find it perturbing that, above, there are proposals to create things like [[List of Assembly demo and intro competition winners]], when that can simply be an embedded list in [[Assembly (demoparty)]]. This fork-everything-into-the-ground approach has to stop. But do note that proposal, and the entire thread up there (among others on these talk pages, along with the few sources), illustrate the that compos are part of the parties and are thus subtopics thereof; the compos at parties like Assembly are not distinct topical entities with their own names and histories. (By contrast, if I may make some further comparisons, the [[World Artistic Pool Championship]], which is held under amid the [[VNEA International Pool Championships]] for shared venue convenience, is a separate event, including for WP purposes, being organized by unrelated organizations, rather like the common practice of having a bank branch inside a supermarket or a chain restaurant inside a huge retail store.

{{rfcquote|text=
[[Amy Hughes]] was recently created, and [[Marathon#Multiple marathons]] was recently updated, to reflect reports that Amy Hughes set a "world record" for most marathons run on consecutive days (53). I believe that this feat received so much coverage because Guinness World Records notes the record to be [http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-marathons-run-on-consecutive-days-%28male%29 52 for men] and [http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-marathons-run-on-consecutive-days-%28female%29 17 for women]. As I mentioned above, this is problematic in that reliable sources reported in 2011 that [[Stefaan Engels]] ran 365 consecutive marathons in 2011 (e.g. [http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/trackandfield/news/story?id=6092994 ESPN], [http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SPORT/02/05/marathon.record.engels.365/ CNN], [http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2011/02/07/133569285/man-runs-365-marathons-in-365-days NPR]); other non-English sources have reported that [[Richard Bottram]] ran 365 back in 2006-2007 and [[Ricardo Abad]] as running 150 consecutive in 2009 and 500 consecutive in from 2010 to 2012. And some sources even have reports that contradict their earlier reports (e.g. see [http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-shropshire-29359358 BBC report on Hughes] vs. [http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-12375646 BBC report on Engels]; see [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/amy-hughes-ultra-runner-set-to-complete-53rd-marathon-in-as-many-days-9759440.html Independent report on Hughes] vs. [http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/athletics/belgian-enters-the-record-books-with-365-marathons-in-a-year-2206331.html Independent report on Engels]). Given the contradiction in reliable sources, I am wondering how this should be handled in [[Amy Hughes]] and elsewhere. - [[User:Location|Location]] ([[User talk:Location|talk]]) 15:15, 17 July 2015 (UTC)}}

We have found several reliable sources in Polish that attribute the order for the massacre to Khmelnytsky. I propose we add a sentence saying so, attributing it to said <s>Polish</s> (also found non-Polish0 sources. It is a biographical fact relevant to Khmelnytsky, and I (disclaimer: a Pole) do not believe ordering of massacre of thousands of prisoners of war is "too minor" to be included here.

The essay [[WP:NSOFT|Notability (software)]] is currently used in some discussions about the notability of articles. On the other hand, it's been five years since this essay was written and the suggestions may be behind the times. There do exist other guidelines on notability of similar topics (ex. [[WP:PRODUCT]] and [[WP:Notability (web)]]), thus the best path forward may be to keep this as an essay and avoid having specific rules for software notability. This RfC is to get more feedback on software notability, on whether or not the community feels a need for a formal guideline, and whether there are changes in consensus, etc. New comers to this topic may choose to take a look at this essay's talk page as well as the talk page of [[WP:Software notability]] for a feel of the general consensus in 2010.

{{ping|Bbb23|Salvidrim!|Mike V|Ponyo|Reaper Eternal|Callanecc}} Do we have a consensus to restrict the usage of this template (and similar) only to admins and [[WP:SPI Clerk|SPI Clerk]]s? If we do have a consensus, we should edit the template documentation to explicitly say that the template should only be used by admins and clerks. This template is very often misused by users. Some users tag other users' pages with this just because they suspect them being sockpuppets, before any investigation is concluded. THe wording of the template does encourage them, I know ("An editor has expressed a concern"). But, it is a very bad way to express your concern. First of all, it is [[WP:UNCIVIL]] to alter other user's page with such a strong accusation without first discussing it at [[WP:SPI]]. And, second, even if the user is a sockpuppet, it is often not useful to tag him per [[WP:DENY]]. So, I think we should make a consensus and alter the documentation so to explicitly say that this template should only be used by admins and clerks, and to say it right at the top (currently, the documentation says that the tag is placed "usually by patrolling administrators at SPI" low in the body of the text).

Between 2012-July 2015, there used to be paid staff in place to support users who used education extension userrights on English Wikipedia. As of July 2015, neither the Wikimedia Foundation nor the Wiki Ed Foundation provide this support anymore. There used to be community consensus that Wikipedia community volunteers should be solicited to request these userrights. Since there is no staff support in place, I propose to quit soliciting that volunteers should request these userrights. In a more discreet way, I would support these rights being granted for anyone who wants to use the powerful tools which they make available, just so long as people understand that the almost essential staff support required to train people for these tools is no longer available. Thoughts from others? Can we quit offering these tools routinely?

A wide breadth of RS, including [[CNN]], [[CBS News]], [[The Daily Beast]], etc. have taken time to report on specific preferences contained in Duggar's alleged accounts. Should it be removed? Specifically: 
:''According to the profile on Duggar's alleged account, he was interested in "experimenting with sex toys," giving oral sex, and bathing with others.'' 
Second, should this be illustrated with a generic image for those who do not know what a sex toy is? 
To clarify: the RfC is asking two questions, for (a) consensus to '''remove''' (not add) the above line (as it existed at the time the RfC was opened but was removed by an editor following the discussion beginning), and, (b) to '''add''' (not remove) an image.

'''Proposal''': impose a one-year moratorium on all move proposals for this article, starting at the time this RfC is closed. Any new move proposals started during the moratorium will be speedily hatted and/or archived.

'''Background''': as noted in the template at the top of this page, this article has been hamstrung by a steady stream of move requests. These requests have not been without merit, but '''no consensus''' closures have been the rule rather than the exception. Since the closure of the most recent move proposal two weeks ago, we have at least three new threads currently on the talk page requesting moves (albeit informally). A moratorium will allow quick hatting of such proposals, attracting the community's attention to more important matters.

A recent proposal to impose a one-year moratorium on all move proposals garnered some support [[Talk:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant/Archive 37#Alternative proposal: one-year moratorium on move proposals|here]], but was closed without comment along with the move discussion of which it was a part. See also [[Talk:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant/Archive 18#RfC: Three months moratorium on page moves|here]] and [[Talk:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant/Archive 14#An RM to ISIS? (moves now prohibited)|here]] for discussions related to the previous moratorium active October 2014-January 2015.

Please note that in the spirit of [[m:The Wrong Version|WP:WRONGVERSION]] a !vote for a moratorium is not synonymous with a !vote for the current name. It is merely a confirmation that endless move proposals are disruptive to article improvement. Similarly, in this discussion section please consider refraining from expressing a preference for any specific article title.

{{rfcquote|text=
FULL DISCLOSURE: I was a paid editor on an AfD'd book article, this RfC discussion is not paid.

A recent AfD, ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lo Mein (book)|closed]] -- latest article article revision here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:009o9/sandbox&diff=676016202&oldid=675657464]) has revealed that the notability expectations of the community is not represented in NBOOK/NBCRIT. This failure to communicate is likely causing extra work for AfC and AfD and causing new editors to write articles that cannot get published. 

My reading of BKCRIT/NBOOK #5 indicates that a thinly referenced book article should fall under the author's notability as a "discriminate collection" in [[WP:DISCRIMINATE]]. This was not my experience, the community adds the caveat that the author's notability must be for books.   

{{talkquote|changes proposed that reflect the information gathered from the AfD in strike/bold
[[WP:BKCRIT]]
A book is notable if it [[WP:V|verifiably]] meets, through [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]], at least one of the following criteria:
# The book has been the subject<ref name="subject"/> of two or more non-trivial<ref name="nontrivial"/> published works appearing in sources that are independent of the book itself.<ref name="independent"/> This includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, other books, television documentaries, bestseller lists,<ref name="bestseller"/> <s>and reviews</s> '''. Or six professional reviews'''. This excludes '''student and college newspapers''',[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:College_and_university_article_guidelines#Reliable_sources] media re-prints of press releases, [[flap copy]], or other publications where the author, its publisher, agent, or other self-interested parties advertise or speak about the book.<ref name="selfpromotion"/>
# ...
# ...
# ...
# The book's author''''s books are''' <s>is</s> so historically significant that any of the author's written works may be considered notable. This does not simply mean that the book's author is notable by Wikipedia's standards; rather, the book's author is of exceptional significance and the <s>author's life and</s> body of written work would be a common subject of academic study.

The five preceding criteria do not necessarily apply to books excluded by the [[WP:BKTS|threshold standards]], and do not apply to [[WP:BKCRYSTAL|books not yet published]].

'''Other considerations'''

'''Threshold standards'''

A book should have, at a minimum, an [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] (for books published after 1975 in a country where ISBNs are normally used), and should be catalogued by its country of origin's official or ''de facto'' [[national library]] (if that country has such a national library). For example, in the United States books are catalogued by the [[Library of Congress]]; in the United Kingdom at the [[British Library]]; in Australia at the [[National Library of Australia]]; in Canada at the [[Library and Archives Canada]]; in France at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]; in Singapore at the [[National Library Board]]; in Brazil by the [[Fundação Biblioteca Nacional]]; in Argentina at [[Biblioteca Nacional de la República Argentina]]; and in India at the [[National Library of India]]. For a complete list, see [[List of national libraries]].

'''Advisory: The current consensus is that [[WorldCat]] entries should number in the hundreds for fiction and non-fiction titles.'''

However, these criteria are [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|exclusionary]] rather than inclusionary; meeting these threshold standards does not imply that a book is notable, whereas a book which does not meet them, most likely is not. There will be exceptions—books that are notable despite not meeting these threshold standards—but good reasons for the notability of such books should be clear.

*1. The sentence "After 1526 the Croatian Parliament elected the Austrian Habsburgs as kings of Croatia ..." makes no sense to me for there is no source ever found supporting it. Moreover, we have a written document showing the nature of this 'election':

{{bq|1=''Jednim glasim''<p>In a 1526 note to a Venetian diplomat, Ban Frankopan informs him that all Slavonia speaks with one voice. Everyone, nobles and commoners, will submit to the Turk before they will accept German rule.</p><p>''Jednim glasim govore sva gospoda, plemstvo i puk, da ce prije pokoriti Turcinu, negoli biti pod Nijemaca'' (29 September 1526)</p><p>The following year Frankopan is killed in battle with Habsburg forces at Varazdin.''<ref>CROATIA 2: LUDWIG VON GAJ OPPOSES CROATIA’S HUNGARIAN HERITAGE by Ivo Vukcevich. Xlibris Corporation, Jul 18, 2013, page 104</ref></p>
}}

*2. Wikipedia's articles handling history of the territory of today's Croatia follows historical narratives which are detailed and elaborated in A. Bellamy's book '''The Formation of Croatian National Identity: A Centuries-Old Dream? by Alex J. Bellamy, Manchester University Press, Dec 4, 2003'''. One of the book reviewers wrote: 
{{bq|1=This volume assesses the formation of Croatian national identity in the 1990s. It develops a novel framework, calling into question both primordial and modernist approaches to nationalism and national identity, before applying that framework to Croatia. In doing so it provides a new way of thinking about how national identity is formed and why it is so important. An explanation is given of how Croatian national identity was formed in the abstract, via a historical narrative that traces centuries of yearning for a national state. The book shows how the government, opposition parties, dissident intellectuals and diaspora groups offered alternative accounts of this narrative in order to legitimize contemporary political programmes based on different versions of national identity. It then looks at how these debates were manifested in social activities as diverse as football, religion, economics and language. This volume attempts to make an important contribution to both the way we study nationalism and national identity, and our understanding of post-Yugoslav politics and society.}}

On the reliability of Croatian sources warned another historian, J.V.A. Fine in his book: '''  The Early Medieval Balkans: a critical survey from the sixth to the late twelfth century by John Van Antwerp Fine - Published 1991 by University of Michigan Press, page 248''':
{{bq|1=Sources on Medieval Croatia Early medieval Croatian history fits the concluding line to the old jingle: the more you study the less you know. When I was and undergraduate studying Balkan history I thought I knew quite a bit about Croatia; but as I study more about Croatia, one by one "facts" that I knew before turn out to be dubious, based on questionable sources or no sources at all. Most of the existing literature in western languages on medieval Croatia is extremely poor; and frequently it is marred by nationalistic bias. Much of the information about medieval Croatian history comes from later (seventeenth- and eighteenth-century) narrative histories. These were written by enthusiastic people but contain a mixture of fact and legend; and since many of the documents they based their works on are now lost, it is extremely difficult to judge whether their information came from reliable source or not.}}

'''Proposal'''. In order to build credibility of Wikipedia as a free encyclopaedia, we shall start rewriting articles by gradually eliminating historical narratives, politics, and nationalism from the articles content. --[[Special:Contributions/72.66.12.17|72.66.12.17]] ([[User talk:72.66.12.17|talk]]) 02:21, 25 July 2015 (UTC)}}

[[Anticyra]] isn't another name for a different time or different period. It's simply the exact same Greek name of the exact same location of a Greek settlement romanized two ways: the traditional Latinized form and the modern treatment. The current situation is not even a POV fork: it's simply a false one: the modern town is sometimes romanized as Anticyra (albeit unofficially now that Greece standardized things) and the ruins are increasingly romanized the modern way. Most of the content of the two pages should be merged here to a single treatment of the ancient and modern settlements at this site, although the treatment of the 1½ unrelated "Anticyras"/"Antikyras" should go to [[Antikyra (disambiguation)]] with a hatnote mention here.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User talk:LlywelynII|<span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em; class=texhtml">Llywelyn<font color="Gold">II</font></span>]] 11:04, 26 July 2015 (UTC)}}

The debate has lasted for several months now and has, at its core, been based around whether the distinct definition of Bigotry (not bigot) can allow for [[WP:NPOV]] or if the term is in violation. @Lincean has argued, through various policies, that Bigotry cannot be NPOV due to its derivation from the word bigot. Various others users, myself included, have argued that Bigotry be included as a reason due to its inherent beliefs and sources have been found to support the claim.

At the moment, the article contains Bigotry as a reason due to the ongoing discussion, but little in-article discussion revolves around bigotry.

Please leave a comment on whether Bigotry can be NPOV or if it should be taken down or found in-quote/attributed. See discussion [[Talk:LGBT rights opposition#Reasons|here, for the full debate.]]

As this is our primary page on the use of disambiguation on Wikipedia, should it not cover the routine (though not overwhelmingly frequent) [[WP:AT|article titling]] and [[WP:RM|requested move]] situation that some titles are naturally too ambiguous and confusing to use without clarification?  Use of disambiguation to clarify inherently ambiguous names, not just to resolve multiple articles competing for the same title, seems to this proponent to be something that editors will obviously expect to be covered here, at least briefly.

Some sample wording:
:{{tq|Uncommonly, there are other scenarios for disambiguating an article title, even when this does not disambiguate between two articles, and there is no hatnote. For example [[Algerian Arab]] is [[WP:NATDIS|naturally disambiguated]] as [[Algerian Arab sheep]], because the shorter title is innately ambiguous (fails the [[WP:PRECISION]] criterion for article titles) and may confuse readers, liable to interpret it as referring to a human population.}}
This keeps being reverted (in whatever exact wording) by the same two editors, on a rationale that appears to be simply disbelief that this is disambiguation-related. <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 12:01, 7 August 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Hi guys.  It's me again with another proposal.  Though it doesn't happen often, accounts can become compromised, and it's usually very difficult, if not impossible, to regain control and prove that the account is under the control of the original user.

I'm proposing to add another layer of security, that can be activated optionally, per user.  Many of use hashes to prove that we are who we are.

My proposal is that the MediaWiki software allows users to save a hash and set what encryption was used to create it.  The hash obviously consists of something other than a password.

If a user finds that their account is compromised, or that they can't login anymore, the can click/tap on the restore access to account link in the login screen.  The restore access form consists of two textboxes.  The first textbox is the username that is compromised, the second asks for the unencrypted has string.  When submitted, MW encrypts the hash based on the set setting and checks if it matches the stored string. 

If the generated hash matches the stored hash, all existing sessions become invalidated, aka the account is forcefully logged off on all devices, and all the tokens associated with the account get recycled.  A new session is started on the computer that provided the hash and the user is now directed to the account setup process, where they provide and email and password.  Once complete, some kind of indication, such as the username turning orange for a day or a log entry, shows the Wiki community that a hash login took place.  This can serve as evidence that account control has been re-established.

Upon failure of providing the correct hash, <s>the account will get locked out, and all devices will get logged out, until the proper hash has been provided.</s> a log entry stating a failed hash login attempt will be made.

'''Optional addition A:'''
3 failed hash attempts will result in a permanent lock out.

'''Setting the hash initially:'''
To set the hash for the first time, the account password must simply be provided.  An optional additional password can be set for the hash only.

'''Changing the hash:'''
To change the hash under normal circumstances, the password that was being used when the hash was last changed, or created, must be provided, along with the optional password if set.

'''Optional addition B:'''
The hash must be changed if a hash login was used.

'''Optional addition C:'''
Hash login is disabled if there is a block on the respective IP.

'''Optional addition D:'''
Hash login will be disabled for 24 hours on 3 failed attempts.

'''How to !vote:'''
If you support the proposal in general, !vote support.  If you also support the optional add-ons, !vote support in the respective sections for A, B, C, and D.  Finally, if you oppose, then !vote in the oppose section.—<sup>[[User:C678|<span style="color:green;font-family:Courier">cyberpower]]</sup><small><sub style="margin-left:-13.5ex;color:\#FF8C00;font-family:Comic Sans MS">[[User talk:C678|<span style="color:\#FF8C00">Chat]]:Limited Access</sub></small> 16:24, 24 August 2015 (UTC)}}

{{edit template-protected|Template:Infobox building|answered=yes}}
Can we add a project_manager (PM) parameter to the template? Over the past two decades, project/construction managers (PM/CM) have become key players in the construction process.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_construction</ref> In the past, they were usually apart of the contracting team. However, now client's often hire a PM/CM firm separately to over see the building process from the very beginning, working closely with architects and engineers to go over plans and drawings, making timetables for the project, determining material and labor costs, negotiating with and hiring subcontractors and workers, scheduling workers on site, gathering permits and making sure everything is up to code.- ''"An owner may also contract with a construction project management company as an advisor, creating a third contract relationship in the project. The construction manager's role is to provide construction advice to the designer, design advice to the constructor on the owner's behalf and other advice as necessary.''"<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_management</ref> 

It has become an important part of the construction process in small-medium-large projects/renovations, and it would be beneficial to include it. Also, it is necessary because adding a construction manager firm's name under any other parameter would be portraying misleading information-it doesn't quite fit anywhere else. Furthermore, the only infobox that attains a sufficing parameter is [[:Template: infobox venue]], however that template does not acquire the appropriate embed codes (a user requested this, but was denied). Can this be added please?

This RfC is relevant to the issue above, but it needs to be separate due to both its nature and the fact that the above conversation has become unproductive. There has been some contention over whether to include the category "LGBT-related video games". This is the first title in the ''Fire Emblem'' series to feature the option to foster a same-sex romance between your player character and a different character. [http://www.polygon.com/2015/6/23/8836513/fire-emblem-fates-same-sex-relationships-nintendo These] [http://www.siliconera.com/2015/07/01/fire-emblem-fates-bisexual-characters-are-shara-and-zero/ sources] have a more detailed description of both the character options and the original interview with Nintendo that revealed this information. Regardless of any media controversy present due to interpretations of the relationship options via translations of Japanese version, two or more editors (see above) feel that due to the optional nature of the romances, the category should be removed. They seem to have yet to give satisfactory reasons related to relevance on the cite or Wikipedia policies for the category's removal. Please voice your '''Support''' or '''Opposition''' to its inclusion below, or have sensible '''Discussion''' about the issue. --[[User:ProtoDrake|ProtoDrake]] ([[User talk:ProtoDrake|talk]]) 09:21, 29 July 2015 (UTC)}}

An aforementioned example is that there is currently no mention of traditional Bonfire Night food (such toffee apples and parkin). It might be helpful to compare the article with [[Christmas]], which does contain sections about both the history of the event and how it is celebrated today.<br>

Other users have argued that the display of  "[Redirected from XXX]" is helpful to a reader who clicks on a link via a redirect, and is not available via  a piped link, and that What-links-here actually gives better information by showing how pages have been linked. [[WP:NOTBROKEN]] currently advises not changing such links in fairly strong terms, specifically saying "{{xt|While there are a limited number of cases where this is beneficial, there is otherwise no good reason to pipe links solely to avoid redirects. Doing so is generally an unhelpful, time-wasting exercise that can actually be detrimental. It is almost never helpful to replace [[redirect]] with [[target|redirect]]}}". Should this be changed to permit or even encourage such changes in smoe or all cases, and if so, in which cases? The previous discussion was too small and too polarized to form a consensus. I now request comment from editors more generally on the matter. [[User:DESiegel|DES]] [[User talk:DESiegel|<sup>(talk)</sup>]] 11:03, 31 July 2015 (UTC)}}

Hong Kong is a country (or as some others may prefer the word "region"), though not a sovereignty state.

There is currently a dispute between myself and [[User:Cartakes|Cartakes]] over the correct naming of former countries (specifically the old imperial dynasties of China) in the top of the article infobox. As it was originally (and I have attempted once to revert this to no avail), the names were simply the period names such as "Sui", "Xia", "Tang" (and on occasion "Great Yuan", "Great Qing", etc. were necessary) which are the official state names from the period. However, he has come along and changed them to include the word "dynasty" with the period name in the infobox title which is not the official state name but a common name. I have attempted to talk to him, but he is adamant that I am incorrect. Even looking at the same articles written in Chinese show that the infobox title without the word "dynasty" in it. The beginning of the discussion is located '''[[User talk:Cartakes#Chinese dynasty names|in this section on his talk page]]''' and I have had a comment from admin [[User:Davidcannon|David Cannon]] who recommended that I come here for help as people here would have more experience in areas such as this.

That is an extreme minority position among reliable sources and the international community as there is wide consensus among sources and the international community that both the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem are occupied by Israel and not in Israel and that the term ''military occupation'' does not mean martial law is imposed but rather that Israel exercises ''effective military control'' over territory outside its borders.

I would like to propose a change to the title of this article and [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)]]. I believe that the most famous “Cyrano de Bergerac” is the play, not the writer, or, at least, that they are of equal fame. In either case, the writer is not more famous than the play.

Therefore:
*Option 1: Move '''[[Cyrano de Bergerac]]''' to '''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (writer)]]''' and '''Cyrano de Bergerac (play)''' to '''Cyrano de Bergerac'''. ('''Support''')
*Option 2: Move '''Cyrano de Bergerac''' to '''Cyrano de Bergerac (writer)''' and leave '''Cyrano de Bergerac (play)''' as it is. ('''Neutral''', may ''support'' as a compromise)
*Option 3: Leave them both as they are. ('''Oppose''')

''' Option 1 '''

#'''Support''' - Not familiar with the author or play, but after a quick search engine test, I would concur that "''the most famous “Cyrano de Bergerac” is the play''". Thus, per [[WP:COMMONNAME]], it would seem that dis-ambiguous ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' should point to the play, and not the author.

I am raising this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israel&type=revision&diff=674458383&oldid=674451863 this] diff as a matter for urgent input regarding the [[Israel]] article.

*As an aspect of the nation of Israel I believe that the significant number of UN resolutions (they've issued '''232 resolutions''' with respect to Israel since 2003, representing 40% of all resolutions issued by the UN over the period) should be at least briefly mentioned under the politics subheading however this is being opposed as violating WP:NPOV. This isn't a matter of NPOV this is simply a matter of fact and it is unfair on the reader to not at least mention this and provide the See also tag which directs the reader to the actual articles that deal with this issue. Some readers on wikipedia might only visit the Israel page looking for what NGOs or the UN have done regarding the actions of the state which we all see in the news. By constantly suppressing this information I believe opponents to this edit are violating the guidelines of wikipedia because they're literally concealing information regarding a subject which is fully sourced simply because they don't ''like'' what the facts are. I've said multiple times that they can add whatever they want to it to "balance" it out but blanking the text and removing the edit it is a shockingly poor attitude to take.

In March 2011, Jimmy Wales [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMy76Strat&action=historysubmit&diff=419433563&oldid=419433552 stated] that RfA was "a broken process". There has since been much discussion about fixing RfA, and some appear to believe that it no longer needs any changes and that Wales' comment is no longer applicable. For those who might comment on such things, I am well aware of the work done at RFA2011, but it has been admitted that no formal RfCs were ever presented to the community as a result of it. RFA2013 also did not appear to include surveys of this nature. (I might be wrong, but in any case it doesn't hurt to get an updated opinion from the newer members of the community.) Before we can ever hope to proceed with any sort of serious reform, the community as a whole must first formally show reasonable agreement on the most fundamental underlying principle of any reform: Is RfA really a broken process (i.e., does RfA need to be reformed or even revolutionized in some manner)? This RfC is ''not'' for discussion on methods by which this might occur. I will emphasize this: '''This RfC is only for the purpose of reaching a consensus on whether or not RfA needs changing in some manner. It does not matter how that might occur at this stage.''' If this RfC gains traction after a day or two, we might consider adding it to [[WP:CENT]] and on the watchlist notice. --[[User:Biblioworm|<span style="color:#6F4E37;">'''''Biblio'''''</span>]][[User_talk:Biblioworm|<span style="color:#6F4E37;">'''''worm'''''</span>]]  20:02, 5 August 2015 (UTC)}}

I propose and seek comments on the following minor change which I believe will resolve most of the ongoing conflict between editors about this part of the Manual of Style, and (more importantly) resolve the confusion that has grown up, over the last two years or so, about how to apply logical quotation, the quotation punctuation system that WP (along with various other non-news and non-fiction publishers) uses.

Working from the present wording (a compromise emerging from some discussions above):

:{{xtn|On the English Wikipedia, use the [[Quotation marks in English#Order of punctuation|"logical quotation"]] style in all articles, regardless of the variety of English in which they are written. Include terminal punctuation within the quotation marks only if it was present in the original material, and otherwise place it after the closing quotation mark. For the most part, this means treating periods and commas in the same way as question marks: Keep them inside the quotation marks if they apply only to the quoted material and outside if they apply to the whole sentence. Examples are given below.}}

change it to this (new material <ins>underlined</ins> to highlight it here):

:{{xt|On the English Wikipedia, use the [[Quotation marks in English#Order of punctuation|"logical quotation"]] style in all articles, regardless of the variety of English in which they are written. <ins>As is usually the case in British style,</ins> include terminal punctuation within the quotation marks only if it was present in the original material, and otherwise place it after the closing quotation mark. For the most part, this means treating periods and commas in the same way as question marks: Keep them inside the quotation marks if they apply only to the quoted material and outside if they apply to the whole sentence. Examples are given below.}}

or something that retains the spirit of all of these points.

;Benefits:
#It doesn't incorrectly equate logical and British quotation, two styles that are demonstrably different in a key way that is directly relevant to Wikipedia editing.
#It does helpfully relate the two, for people familiar with the most common styles in British vs. American publications, but not already familiar with logical quotation.
#It helpfully, accurately, and extremely concisely describes the principal difference between British and logical quotation (the only one that would commonly arise), in a way that editors can apply without any need for additional analysis or research of quotation styles: It compresses into the single word "usually" the concept that in various situations, British style does not actually keep terminal punctuation outside the closing quotation mark if it was not in the original material, and may even change punctuation marks within the quotation, neither of which are done in logical quotation.
#The "usually" also happily avoids any confusion between academic "British style" as advocated by Oxford and Fowler (broadly similar to logical quotation), and "British style" as used by some British fiction publishers (a hybrid of "American" punctuation-aways-inside and single-then-double quotation mark nesting order (British news style, another hybrid, is the exact opposite, and can be treated as BQ.)
#Avoids giving [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]] to sources that gloss over the distinction between, and treat as equivalent, logical and Oxford quotation for their own reasons. Their not acknowledging the difference [[WP:NOR|does not mean WP is in a position]] to say there isn't one.
#It doesn't delete, against longstanding consensus, the sourced term "logical quotation", the only known name for logical quotation (or what some might want to unhistorically call "a variant of British punctuation that dispenses with any rules that sometimes permit placing non-original terminal punctuation, or altering the original punctuation, inside the quotation marks").

Two optional copy-edits: Remove the doubly-redundant "On the English Wikipedia" (nothing in English Wikipedia's MoS applies outside English Wikipedia, and the lang:en version at that); and remove the unnecessary repetition of "marks" in the next-to-last sentence.

The CDC provides a nice history of the terminology used to refer to ADHD over the years [http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/documents/timeline.pdf here]. In the DSM2 it was known as "hyperkinetic reaction of childhood". In the DSM3 it was known as ADD and was divided into two types "ADD with hyperactivity" and "ADD without hyperactivity". In the DSM3R the term ADHD was introduced. In the DSM4 the term ADHD was kept and it was divided into a subtypes: "[[Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_predominantly_inattentive|predominantly inattentive]]", "predominantly hyperactive-impulsive" and "combined type". The "ADHD predominantly inattentive" type is the new term for "attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity" with this ref says "the predominantly inattentive type is analogous to attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity" [https://books.google.ca/books?id=Eg9U9e_ICr8C&pg=PA237#v=onepage&q&f=false].

There was a brief period of time during the DSM3R were there was "undifferentiated ADD" and this version referred to "predominantly inattentive type".[https://books.google.ca/books?id=DjmgBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT23]

The proposal based on the above evidence is:
*"Attention deficit disorder" without qualifiers should redirect to "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder"
*"[[undifferentiated attention deficit disorder]]" and "[[attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity]]" should redirect to "[[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive]]" as they do now
*"[[attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity]]" should redirect to "[[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]" we we do not have a specific article on "[[attention deficit hyperactive disorder combined type]]" [[User:Doc James|<span style="color:#0000f1">'''Doc James'''</span>]] ([[User talk:Doc James|talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/Doc James|contribs]] · [[Special:EmailUser/Doc James|email]]) 03:04, 9 August 2015 (UTC)}}

Hong Kong is a country (or as some others may prefer the word "region"), though not a sovereignty state. It has its own flag: The HKSAR Flag, which is widely recognised by International Olympic Committee and some other international organisations (e.g. APEC) under the name of "Hong Kong, China" (often referred to as the Olympic Standard). This is recognised and approved also by the central government of P.R. China. I strongly request related articles to list Hong Kong in the country list (in the form of "Hong Kong, China" if preferred to avoid disputes), and to list its SAR Flag int the flag list.
The situation is highly similar to Puerto Rico of U.S., Gibraltar of U.K., and French Polynesia of France. The reasons are: Hong Kong enjoys its own currency (HK Dollar), has its own border (with independent immigration and customs control), own jurisdiction system (common law and Court of Final Appeal), and is recognised as an economy. <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Groverlynn|Groverlynn]] ([[User talk:Groverlynn|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Groverlynn|contribs]]) </span></small>


:Here are the key points against your argument:
:*Hong Kong is not an independent (sovereign) country, it is [[Special administrative region]] of China. And so does not match any of the other flags on the list, which are all sovereign countries.
:*Hong Kong is a second tier administrative unit, like an American State, or Chinese Province, and does not match any of the other flags on the list, which are all first order administrative units..
:*The Olympics is not an authority on what is a first level administrative unit. People of Hong Kong are represented in the United Nations by China, which is the first level administrative unit, as an example.
:*For these reasons, primarily that the inclusion of the Hong Kong flag is inconsistent with inclusion criteria for other flags on this list, Hong Kong should be considered part of China and use the Chinese flag. I would like to hear from other users on this as well. [[User:Mattximus|Mattximus]] ([[User talk:Mattximus|talk]]) 18:15, 9 August 2015 (UTC)}}

I recently began a discussion with another editor with regards to the placement of new Talk Page sections for the WP Policies & Guidelines ''[[WP:NCCL]],'' which had been dormant until my recent proposal since June of 2014. I will summarize my initial position, in quotation, below:

{{Quotation|The idea of new discussions (on unique areas of the WP guidelines) being best found on the bottom of the Talk Page appears contradictory to the intention of making them easily found. It seems to me that especially where Talk Page activity that effects WP Policies & Guidelines both covers a unique knowledge area and has been long-dormant, new issues should be presented at the forefront of the Page.|align=center}}

'''Proposal''' is therefore that we give consideration to including an exception to the current prescriptions of WP:TALKNEW, that distinctive new Sections added to the Talk Pages of articles discussing WP Policies & Guidelines that have been inactive beyond a reasonable period of time should be raised to the top of the said Page. --[[User:UBI-et-ORBI|UBI-et-ORBI]] ([[User talk:UBI-et-ORBI|talk]]) 13:31, 21 August 2015 (UTC)}}

:''See also: [[#Proposal for regular use of hatnotes on biographical articles to facilitate links to "others" with a shared or similar name]]''

In relation to the above named proposal (but hopefully with stand alone content) I propose that a [[:Template:Navbox]] system (or similar) might be developed so as to present additional and relevant navigation content in a similar format as various [[:Template:Infobox]] examples.  Perhaps this might be done in a similar way as [[:Template:Wikt]] with fixed width or perhaps it might be enabled to combine with content such as [[:Template:TOC right]] with variable width.  

In the previously mentioned thread I have again used the example of the navigation content presented in the namespace [[John Smith]]

In this case a code content such as "{{tq|<nowiki>{{navbox|John (given name)|Smith (surname)}}</nowiki>}}" could result in a page display (hopefully without the additional horisontal line and maybe to a different width/spacing) in a format such as:

{{Infobox geopolitical organization
|name = <small>See also: [{{blue|hide}}]</small>
|membership_type =   [[:John (given name)]]<br />
'''[[:Smith (surname)]]
|membership =        &nbsp;
}}

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Perhaps the ''width'' might correspond to the width such as the contents such as are produced by templates like [[:Template:Wiktionary|Wiktionary]] which, has an output at [[:John (given name)]], that presents:

{{Wiktionary|John}}

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*Perhaps the a navbox could use bullet points in parallel to the system used via [[:Template:TOC right]]. (See [[John Smith]] for a relatively long example of a right justified TOC).

In whatever way it might be made to work, I think that something like this can only increase the navigability of our pages.

=='''RfC to discuss possible changes to the threshold for Autopatrolled''''''

__NOTOC__
Preliminary discussions at:
*[[Wikipedia talk:Autopatrolled#Autopatrolled – reduce the number of qualifying articles... again?...]]
:and
*[[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)/Archive_122#Threshold_for_Autopatrolled_rights]]
demonstrate that  the community  may  wish  to  consider changing  the recommended number of perfect, non redirect/dab articles required for the Autopatrolled flag (Currently 50). Participants are reminded that this 'right' is not an award and has no consequences or benefits for the flag holder. The flag  is accorded at  Administrators' discretion  after reviewing a candidate's editing  history. The actual process for requesting this flag  can be viewed at  [[WP:PERM]]. 

<small>This RfC will be published at related venues and shall run  for at least 30 days and be closed by an uninvolved editor.</small>

'''Support'''

# How many more times do we have to go through this process?  There is no consensus for having such a high threshold.  [[User:Kudpung]], did you [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Autopatrolled&diff=680156184&oldid=679985102 revert] it because you actually disagree with it, or because you think there's some important value in being bureaucratic about this?  <br/> Also, don't forget [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion&oldid=405339313#How_can_we_encourage_more_NPPers.3F this discussion] or [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 83#Autopatrolled - reduce number of qualifying articles|this one]].  This has been discussed repeatedly, there has never been any significant objection, and I really do not see any value in having a fifth round of this.  Also, see [[WP:PGBOLD]]:  you need to articulate a substantive, non-bureaucratic reason for reverting this change.  It is the community's actual [[WP:POLICY]] that "you should not remove any change solely on the grounds that there was no formal" RFC with a bureaucratic closing statement written by an independent editor.  Reversions should be made only by editors who ''personally'' disagree with the ''substance'' of the change, not those who disagree with how many hoops have been jumped through.

I have been working with the editor who has contributed this essay to look with them at some of their concerns about the ways we deploy advice on our policies and guidelines to inexpert and inexperienced Wikipedia editors. We do, at times, [[WP:BITE|bite them]], sometimes quite severely, and this is always a cause for concern. I have promised them that I will give them guidance on the mechanism for taking their thoughts forward into the community with a view to the contents of this essay being discussed and either adopted (as they stand or modified by consensus) or taken forward to specific forums for discussion.

This Request for the comments of those interested editors is the first step in this process. [[User:Timtrent|<span style="color:#800">Fiddle</span>]] [[User talk:Timtrent|<span style="color:#070">Faddle</span>]] 15:27, 11 August 2015 (UTC)}}

{{u|Jytdog}} and other:

A factual issue in this article has come to my attention. 

As reported in other Talk section in this article I am a paid consultant to Beep and have a COI.

It seems the [[Wall Street Journal]] reported 2014 revenue of $100 million when that should have been 2015 and this incorrect info is on the story (final sentence in History section). 

I have three other sources that have the correct info: <ref>{{cite news|last1=Manjoo|first1=Farhood|title=An Online Tune-Up for the Used-Car Marketplace|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/technology/personaltech/an-online-tune-up-for-the-used-car-marketplace.html|accessdate=11 September 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=22 April 2015}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|last1=Tishin|first1=Donkersley|title=Beepi expands to Phoenix – interview with CEO Alejandro Resnik|url=http://aztechbeat.com/2015/04/beepi-expands-to-phoenix-interview-with-ceo-alejandro-resnik/|accessdate=11 September 2015|publisher=AZ Tech Beat|date=10 April 2015}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=Beepi in Phoenix, expects $100 mil 2015|url=http://aimgroup.com/2015/04/11/beepi-in-phoenix-expects-100-mil-2015/|website=AIMGroup.com|publisher=Aim Group}}</ref> 

In this circumstance, I'd say the weight of sources suggests changing the 2014 to 2015. 

Or if you think the conflict is not resolvable, just deleting the sentence. [[User:BC1278|BC1278]] ([[User talk:BC1278|talk]]) 18:58, 11 September 2015 (UTC)}}

Should the area number be made consistent with other encyclopaedias/sites' country profile ([https://books.google.ca/books?id=LccRAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA432#v=onepage&q&f=false][https://books.google.ca/books?id=mdSNh40JB54C&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q&f=false][http://asialeds.org/country-profiles/india][https://books.google.ca/books?id=wQfnAsqs5jMC&pg=PT8#v=onepage&q&f=false][http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/ae930e/ae930e0g.htm]) as well as the wiki article listing nations by [[Land area]]? This number reflects area under de-facto control by the country, just like other country articles on WP.<br> <br>Naturally, the same logic extends to whether the infobox should display the version ([https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/b/bb/20091115234033%21India_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg]) which neither shows other claims on Indian controlled territory, nor Indian claims on non-Indian-controlled territories. A map to display claims is already shown later in the article under 'Subdivisions'.<br>
<br>By leaving the current map (and area number) as is, it subtly pushes a POV only showing Indian claims on other territory, whilst not applying the same to disputed territory controlled by India (Indian controlled J&K + Arunachal Pradesh in dark green). Not to mention that it is inconsistent with how other encyclopaedias and even WP conveys such information.

Reading through this article, I found a number of problems, enumerated here:
# The details of Kim Davis's career are of no importance to the controversy at hand. As [[WP:BIO1E]] says, for people who are notable for one event, such as Mrs. Davis, we should focus on the event, and not the person.  The entirety of the "2014 election" section has nothing to do with what Davis is known for, so should be deleted.
# Related to above, the source for the "Deputy clerk" section is from 2011 and has nothing to do with the current controversy, and so should be deleted.  I believe it was included in an attempt to attack Davis' character and undermine her position.
# The section "Election history" has the same problem as above, they do not mention the current controversy at all, and so should be deleted.  
# The section "Personal life" is not in chronological order.  The internet likes to call Davis a hypocrite because of her multiple marriages, but her conversion to Christianity happened in 2011, ''after'' the multiple marriages.  It is not our responsibility nor right to attempt to attack her in such an underhanded way.  This section should be re-ordered in chronological order to make clear this consistency.

I propose scaling the size of the swastika in the infobox down slightly from '''120px''' to '''100px'''. I believe that for a lone symbol, the image is slightly too big and draws attention away from the articles that it appears in. By scaling it down slightly (yes, it may not seem like much but it makes a huge difference), aesthetics are greatly improved. '''I have placed the template to the side of this discussion for visual aid: the top infobox has the swastika scaled to 100px, and the bottom is scaled to the current 120px.'''

Hi! With FrescoBot today [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Worcester&action=historysubmit&type=revision&diff=676033849&oldid=675980640 I was fixing] wikilinks piped for the sole purpose of inserting the [[saxon genitive]] within the link. For example:
*<code><nowiki>...on top of [[Worcester cathedral|Worcester cathedral's]] tower</nowiki></code> --> <code><nowiki>...on top of [[Worcester cathedral]]'s tower</nowiki></code> 
It was the first time I was fixing this issue and I considered it a simple extension of the original BRFA ([[Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/FrescoBot 2|2]], [[Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/FrescoBot 7|7]]), but I understimate it since someone argued that ''these two are visually different and the former is a deliberate choice''. Other examples:
*<code><nowiki>[[George Washington|George Washington's]] administration</nowiki></code> --> <code><nowiki>[[George Washington]]'s administration</nowiki></code> 
*<code><nowiki>The [[Canterbury Association|Canterbury Association's]] surveyor Captain Joseph Thomas...</nowiki></code> --> <code><nowiki>The [[Canterbury Association]]'s surveyor Captain Joseph Thomas...</nowiki></code> 
*<code><nowiki>[[The Simpsons|The Simpsons']] fifteenth season</nowiki></code> --> <code><nowiki>[[The Simpsons]]' fifteenth season</nowiki></code>
From my point of view this deliberate choice is a mistake: including the 's inside the wikilink is not correct per [[WP:LINKCLARITY]] because the topic we are linking is [[Worcester cathedral]], not [[Worcester cathedral|something that belongs to Worcester cathedral]]. The meaning of ''"Worcester cathedral"'' is the same of ''"the Worcester cathedral"'' or ''"the cathedral of Worcester"'', but it is different from ''"Worcester cathedral's"'' or ''"of Worcester cathedral"'' or ''"in the Worcester cathedral"''. For the very same reason I was fixing as well:
*<code><nowiki>[[Bishop|Bishop of]] [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]</nowiki></code> --> <code><nowiki>[[Bishop]] of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]</nowiki></code>
*<code><nowiki>...in the video game [[Tron: Evolution|Tron: Evolution.]]</nowiki></code> --> <code><nowiki>...in the video game [[Tron: Evolution]].</nowiki></code>
*<code><nowiki>[[cathedral|"cathedral"]]</nowiki></code> --> <code><nowiki>"[[cathedral]]"</nowiki></code>
*<code><nowiki>[[1988|1988-]][[1989|89]]</nowiki></code> ([[1988|1988-]][[1989|89]]) --> <code><nowiki>[[1988]]-[1989|89]]</nowiki></code> ([[1988|1988]]-[[1989|89]])
Please note that all these fixes obviously affect the visual output of the page, nevertheless I believe that this problem is not just a matter of taste, but a (small) mistake we can fix. These changes make the wikitext more simple and readable and the links more semantically precise. -- [[User:Basilicofresco|<span style="font:small-caps 1em Verdana;color:green">Basilicofresco</span>]] ([[User talk:Basilicofresco|msg]]) 10:23, 14 August 2015 (UTC)}}

Hi, I think that it is finally time to modernize and fix the community portal once and for all.
For me, the portal contains many issues and is a disgrace to what Wikipedia can be. Here are the main issues- 


*Objects and texts off the page. (I dont know if this happens with everyone but it still happens with some people for sure depending on the device. This is shown in this picture-[[File:Communityportalissues.png|thumb|Comunity portal issues]]


*Old fashioned layout, colors, fonts, and icons.


*Cluttered appearance with complex navigation.


*The page is also screwed up in mobile view on my phone.


Now I am not just posting this to complain, I have actually come up with a solution! I have constructed a more modern, streamline, no-clutter version. I have included all of the same content, just in different forms and places. Here are my changes-


*I took out the cluttered, confusing '''Help out''' section and replaced it with a single button in the '''interact more''' menu. The button takes one to the [[WP:Job Center]] page that I recently revamped and brought back from inactivity. The '''Job Center''' page contains a full comprehensive list of jobs that can be done by basic editors (yet to add an admin. section) and their corresponding pages that need to be fixed. So that button takes you to a page with an even better and more complete list of tasks to complete to help out.


*I removed the '''Help Desk''', '''Reference Desk''', and '''Teahouse''' buttons from the '''interact more''' menu. I then replaced them with a single button that takes one to [[WP:Ask for help]]. '''Ask for help''' is a hub page kind of like the Job Center that has a list of 4 ways/places to ask for help. It not only has links to the 3 help pages that I removed the buttons for but it also explains how to ask for help on one's user page. So that means that with one button, I packed in more info. than what was in the previous three, also removing clutter.


*I changed almost all of the buttons from the '''interact more''' menu to have more modern logos.


*I put the different sections of the page into boxes to add a neat streamline background and effect while fixing the problem of content being off the page.


*I redid the Lead section to be more simple and less cluttered and more welcoming.


The proposed version is at [[Wikipedia:Community portal/Draft]]. The version in my sandbox is for sure what I am proposing as someone might mess with the one in the draft section. I can easily implement it. It works well on my phone in mobile view too. Even though I dont see much opposition, I don't want any unneccesary controversy so I am posting this here to come to consensus on this. Thanks :)

This is to formally decide on whether to use <code>James (brother of Jesus)</code> or <code>James, brother of Jesus</code> '''not''' to debate a move to either "Saint James" or "James the Just". This is based on the recent moves from "James the Just" to the current title of "James, brother of Jesus", as well as the contested [[WP:BOLD]] move to "James (brother of Jesus)" that has been reverted.
*A) [[Wikipedia:Parenthetical disambiguation|Parenthetical disambiguation]]: <code>James (brother of Jesus)</code> has precedent cases of [[Jude (brother of Jesus)]] and [[Simon (brother of Jesus)]]
*B) [[Wikipedia:Natural disambiguation|Natural disambiguation]]: <code>James, brother of Jesus</code> has minor precedent with [[Joses#Joses.2C_brother_of_Jesus|Joses#Joses,_brother_of_Jesus]]

This will be based on votes for "A)" '''''or''''' "B)", unless there are significant arguments from the minority side. In the case of an undecided consensus, the article will remain on the current title of ''natural disambiguation'' "James, brother of Jesus".

There are a number of problems with this article as it exists currently, but the most glaring issue is the almost exclusive focus on supernaturalism is western culture/religion, the most blatant example of this being that the section on Catholicism makes up more than a third of the article, and no major or minor religion even gets so much as a sub-section!! The lead states that "Most religions include the supernatural", but why is there only a section on Catholicism? What about all the other religions? Even in the rest of the article, there is no information whatsoever about the supernatural elements of any eastern religions/philosophies, for example. Why have these been omitted, and what can be done to fix this?

Can the "You've got mail" / "YGM" templates contain an auto signature, time reference, automatic note placed in edit summary or similar?

The standard request move template is written as:

If your reasoning includes search engine results, please present Google Books or Google News Archive results before providing other web results. Do not sign this.}}</nowiki>

Surely the "You've got mail" template should do similar?  In agreement with comment above, I don't personally think that Wikipedia should have a mail facility which seems to me to be a bit like notes being passed under the table.  It contravenes concepts of transparency particularly in the context that Wikipedia otherwise has guidelines on such topics as [[WP:CANVAS]].  At the very least I think that notifications such as "You've got mail" should give who, when and (in the context of edit summary) what type references.

This dispute is about the following description of Ant-Man in the article: "A former petty criminal, who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink in scale '''but increase in strength.'''" (emphasis added) Does Ant-Man's suit ''increase'' his strength or merely preserve his existing strength?  The movie says that while shrunk, "you have the force of a 200 pound man".[http://marvel.com/news/movies/24825/two_new_marvels_ant-man_clips_show_off_scotts_ant-man_training]  Is this referring to Paul Rudd?  Additionally, other sources, such as this [http://screenrant.com/ant-man-movie-comic-book-origin-powers-costume-wasp-yellowjacket/] and this [http://marvel.com/characters/2/ant-man] specifically say that he only has the strength of a normal person while shrunk, though the latter source appears to be referring to the comic book character.  Are the sources that say his strength increases confused/forgetting to qualify with "in proportion", or does the suit actually give Ant Man superhuman strength?

The WikiProject for Article Revision has implemented a few special template tags, including <nowiki>{{Article under repair}}</nowiki> and <nowiki>{{Article lost cause}}</nowiki>, however I'd like to establish consensus about their usage. 

{{Article under repair|date=(September 2015)|note=We're working to bring this article up to Wiki standards}}
{{Article lost cause|date=(September 2015)}}

Firstly, I'd like to go over what the project is intended to do. The primary purpose of it's establishment is to take article stubs, or direly incomplete articles — specifically articles which could bear useful information, and improve them. The tags serve as a fundamental part of this process.  The custom templates allow for members of the WikiProject to notify other editors (as well as patrollers) that the article should be cut some slack as we are working to establish the article. 

The lost cause tag also serves a major role in this process. By using the lost cause tag, it notifies other editors and patrollers the article likely is not up to standards, and potentially will never be (without critical intervention or resources). This simply serves as a means to allow for notices to be sourced.

If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to leave them here.

== Proposal: SPA template should not be used for dynamic IPs '''

When an unregistered user's IP address is dynamic, each IP they edit from is used only for a few hours, so the list of contributions from any one of their IPs generally is confined to whatever article they were editing at the time. On that basis, one user has tagged each IP I've used in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:IQ_and_Global_Inequality#RFC:_Should_the_article_summarize_the_book.27s_argument.3F this discussion] with the "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Spa single purpose account]" template. (See also the discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:43.228.158.25 here].) The SPA tag is intended to indicate something about the nature of the user whose posts are being tagged, but the way it's used in this case it only indicates something about the user's internet connection. This use seems contrary to the tag's purpose, but according to the one admin I've discussed it with ([[user:Nyttend]]), using it this way technically is allowed. Would it be possible to change the instructions for this tag so that it only can be used for either registered editors, or unregistered editors whose IP address stays the same over a long period?

I'm re-requesting a [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] about changing GJ and Gl short forms into Gliese for consistency, and policy wise reasons.

*1st According to [[WP:NC]] article names should be ''consistent'' with similar articles 'GJ' and 'Gl' is short for 'Gliese' and most articles on Wikipedia use the word 'Gliese' over 'GJ' and you can clearly see this on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:List_of_exoplanets_in_the_Gliese_Catalog Gliese Exoplanet Catagory] or on the [[Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars]] If you remember from the inital consensus [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Astronomical_objects/Archive_22#Gliese_vs._GJ here] objects with 4 digits should be called GJ and objects with 3 digits should bear the title 'Gliese'. This is not the case, there articles such as [[GJ 180]] that are triple digit entries and use the GJ acronym rather than the Gliese and vise versa for quadruple digit numbers. Even if this was all perfect all entries in the Gliese catalog would not have a consistent name.

*2nd According to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Abbreviations#Acronyms MoS] "An acronym should be written out in '''full''' the first time it is used on a page". I'm only asking for the article title to bear the name Gliese rather than GJ just for consistency in category lists however it should be mentioned in the beginning of an article as well. I understand the concern with using this point is that we will have to change all HD entries to Henry Draper entries however this is not a discussion about the HD Catalog. But MoS also states that an acronym can be used if the object is best known by it or if it is a ship. Ever since the discoveries (and disputes) of [[Gliese 581 c]], [[Gliese 581 d]], [[User:Davidbuddy9/Gliese 581 g|Gliese 581 g]], [[Gliese 667 Cc]] the word Gliese is more known to everyday people than GJ which was not the case when the previous consensus took place. We also know that all Gliese entries are ''not [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Abbreviations#Ship_names ships]'' so that one can be ruled out as well.

Other reasons I heard is that other websites and catalogs use GJ instead of Gliese. I will tell everyone what I was told when I used the other sources excuse "Wikipedia has different goals, policies, and standards than other sources." The changed name would fit better with other Exoplanets and stellar objects that are in the [[Gliese Catalog]]. Agian this is all about consistency, being consistent with everything else in the same catalog should really not be something disputable. Also note were not abbreviating anything in the Kepler Catalog either. -[[User:Davidbuddy9|Davidbuddy9]] ([[User talk:Davidbuddy9|talk]]) 23:41, 18 August 2015 (UTC)}}

**** S51438, what Gabe and I suggested concerned the dissents section, not the majority. Dissents and majorities differ markedly. In this case, given the number of dissents, it would be impossible to treat them alike without producing an unacceptably long dissents section, one that overwhelms the majority opinion, drowning it in a sea of verbiage. The dissents can not exceed the majority section, which would be a balance problem. To ensure that, one should be more generally topical and thematic with the dissents. Generally speaking, it is neither necessary nor desirable to explain every detail, point, or argument in any decision. Selection must be made for readability and emphasis in the space available and prudent. 
**** So I propose: (a) that you leave the majority as it was before today; and (b) that you focus on distilling each dissent to its two or three most extensive points, very briefly developed, adding drive-by references to a couple of lesser but noteworthy points, space provided, making sure not to significantly exceed the majority in length, cumulatively. It it could be shorter, so much the better, but that may require avoiding discussing the dissents (entirely) separately. 
**** I suggest we now sleep on it, doing nothing for about a day. Perhaps others will chime in by then. [[User:Antinoos69|Antinoos69]] ([[User talk:Antinoos69|talk]]) 06:05, 19 August 2015 (UTC)}}

Hi guys.

In an ongoing effort to improving Cyberbot II's newest feature which is, placing archives on dead sources, '''detecting if untagged sources are dead''', and archiving those that are still alive, the bolded feature still needs much work before I can enable it.

I am looking for users here who can propose different checks that can be put in an algorithm to accurately determine a dead link.

When proposing, create a new level 3 header and propose the algorithm to be discussed.  Users may support or oppose, but remember we are simply compiling ideas at the moment.—<sup>[[User:C678|<span style="color:green;font-family:Courier">cyberpower]]</sup><small><sub style="margin-left:-10.1ex;color:olive;font-family:Comic Sans MS">[[User talk:C678|<span style="color:olive">Chat]]:Online</sub></small> 19:53, 2 September 2015 (UTC)}}

While the form currently prescribed in the guidelines makes reference to occasionally using the appropriate Roman Catholic convention for naming members of the Cardinalate; it recommends that it not be used in the actual titling of Articles. Furthermore, when the appropriate form '''''is''''' employed within the text of an article: the current prescription is to always use a redirect or piped link. However, to my mind, it seems much more accurate for the convention to be the reverse: ''the Article Title should follow the naming convention established universally by the Church (i.e., [First], ["Cardinal"] [Last]; as in "Donald, Cardinal Wuerl"), and redirects/piping applied to the use of the informal style (e.g. "Cardinal Wuerl," "Donald Wuerl," etc).'' This is not so much a matter of style as it is of accuracy ––&nbsp;determining the nature of the title is not the province of the reference guide, it belongs to the organization which grants the title.

Note: The exchange below was with [[User: Grump International]], who upon closer examination, turned out to be running a probable sock puppet account with an undisclosed COI. Please see [[WP:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard#Brickell_Flatiron]] for a full examination. Two of the articles [[User: Grump International]]'s were immediately nominated for speedy deletion by [[WP:COIN]] editors. The Conduit article has a long history of attacks, over several years, (before it was recently split off from [[Conduit (publisher network and platform)]] into a separate article, and had to be placed on protected status for several years. I believe the flag here, saying this article reads like a news release and mentioning possible speedy deletion, is part of this attack pattern. People attacking articles can have an undeclared COI or personal bias as much as those contributing to articles (or Talk pages). You'll see the article has significant criticism of the company. It is hardly a news release. [[User: Grump International]] simultaneously nominated for deletion the 5-year old article about the CEO of this company (which until a couple of years ago, at 260 million users, was larger than Twitter, and the largest Internet company in Israel.) [[WP: Articles for deletion/Ronen Shilo]]

I have a declared [[WP:COI]] with respect to Conduit as I am a paid business consultant to the company. As such, I have made no direct edits here. I'd request that a neutral editor to look at the article and make any changes they think are needed to make the article neutral or point out issues and ask me to suggest changes on this Talk page. I am happy to go over the article section by section. By the way, the direct edits you see in the history from me are a result of Wikipedia admin [[User:Graeme Bartlett|Graeme Bartlett]] moving over my accounts' sandbox history when he decided to move the draft on my sandbox to this article.  

Note: I'd suggest deleting this sentence in the History section as it's not terribly relevant. "In 2010 Conduit then-president Adam Boyden was featured in Forbes.com, discussing the link between successful social gaming and marketing principles." In my sandbox draft of this article, I tried to be deferential to other users' contributions but on second thought, I should have suggested deleting this sentence.

Extremely difficult to see how accurate lists of best-selling girl groups and their singles and albums worldwide and by country can ever be produced. A previous discussion (archived at the top of the talk page) suggested overall that the article could be improved by checking the referencing and by using sales and certification sources from each country, but there are major flaws to these arguments: most of the Korean and Japanese references are in those languages, so the article would have to be policed by somebody who speaks them, and there are few definitive sales figures from before the 1990s (and outside the US and UK, few certifications as well). This has led to the article being heavily biased in favour of acts and records from the last twenty years with no obvious solution as to how to address this, or to how a definitive sales ranking can be produced when there are no sales figures available. In addition, there has been no definition of what constitutes a "girl group" (does it include female duos? rap acts such as Salt-n-Pepa?), and there has been a decision to have separate tables for physical and digital sales, leading to the question as to how it is possible to separate the two in most cases, as usually just a single overall sales figure is produced. A similar "List of best-selling boy bands" has already been deleted due to failure to address such concerns.

Over the past year I have been dramatically expanding and re-writing this article using the range of academic, peer-reviewed studies that have been published on the subject, in the hope of ultimately bringing it up to GA status. As part of this I expanded the sub-section on "Morality and ethics". As I constructed it, this section consisted of four, completely academically-referenced paragraphs. The former two dealt with such issues as ethical guidelines and gender norms within the community. The latter two looked at issues of serious ethical debate within the Heathen community, focusing on such subjects as appropriate sexual behaviour (with particular relevance to the place of LGB Heathens within the community), environmentalism, and attitudes toward archaeology and heritage. All of these issues have been raised as being significant by academic commentators in their study of the Heathen new religious movement and thus I certainly thought them worthy of mention within this Wikipedia article too. 

Earlier today, [[User:ThorLives]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Germanic_neopaganism&diff=678854512&oldid=678093619 removed those latter two paragraphs] with the statement that in doing so they were "keeping it simple". I was concerned that this was simply sweeping pertinent ethical issues under the rug because of one editors' personal opinion on the relevance of those issues - an opinion that wasn't in accordance with the academic studies of the subject. Thus, I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Germanic_neopaganism&diff=678911357&oldid=678854512 restored those paragraphs] (and thus initiating the [[Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle|Bold, Revert, Discuss]] cycle), arguing that it was not appropriate to delete such academically-referenced information unilaterally. However, they then simply [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Germanic_neopaganism&diff=678990544&oldid=678917613 removed the information for a second time], posting a rather odd message onto both my talk page and this talk page stating that while they "respect [my] lifestyle choices" (and therefore assuming that because I am interested in LGBT issues I must be LGBT?), they still believe that information on the LGB-themed ethical issues that the Heathen community faces were not important enough to be discussed in the article, regardless of what academics have written on the subject. Clearly ThorLives &ndash; a self-described [[Odinism|Odinist]] who clearly and understandably cares a great deal about this religion and the way that it is being presented on Wikipedia &ndash; is well intentioned but I do disagree with their point of view and the way that they have repeatedly deleted these paragraphs without any support from other editors. Fearing that there would simply be an endless edit war that emerged from the situation, I thought it best to take this issue to RFC, so that un-involved editors can have their say on this issue and we can hopefully come up with a compromise.

'''Brief background of the issue and dispute:'''

There has been much discussion about how to describe/identify [[Camille Paglia]] when mentioning her comments about ''Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)'' (the subject of the article). Discussions can be found at [[WP:BLPN#Mattress Performance (Carry_That_Weight)]] and above on this page at [[Talk:Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)#Camille Paglia]]. 

The sentence in question is (in its current form), {{tq|<u>Social critic</u> [[Camille Paglia]] described Mattress Performance as "a parody of the worst aspects of that kind of grievance-oriented feminism," adding that a feminist work "should empower women, not cripple them."}} I have underlined the descriptor in question.

The current version uses "social critic" to describe Paglia. Past versions used other labels, including "feminist". There is disagreement in using the label "feminist" to describe her. However a number of sources and other academics say otherwise (see past discussions and [[Camille Paglia]] for details). She uses the label to describe herself, specifically "dissident feminist" or "outside the feminist mainstream". 

'''How should [[Camille Paglia]] be described/identified in the article?'''

Based on past discussion, following suggestions have been given:
#Social critic
#Feminist
#Dissident feminist (with text that Paglia uses this to refer to self)
#Professor
#Professor at [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)]]
#Author
#''No label''
#Cultural critic (late addition; see [[#Discussion]] below for WSJ source).

I am initiating this RfC because clear consensus has not been reached in either forum despite days of discussion. I hope this RfC will bring fresh perspectives and generate consensus. Thank you.

This RfC asks whether the word "seize (control of)" should be considered a loaded term and therefore avoided in descriptions of the way that Europeans came to colonize and dominate the American continent, and if it should be substituted with the term "acquire (control of)"?

'''Survey'''

#'''No''', Seize is a perfectly fitting an neutral description of the many cases in which colonization was made possible by the use of force in removing control of territory from Native populations. The contention that in some cases lands had been largely depopulated through epidemics is not relevant for this fact since it accounts for a small proportion of the cases. Scholarly consensus is that native populations were generally weakened by epidemics to the point of not offering adequate resistance to colonization, but it is not generally considered that depopulation was so extreme that the use of forcible seizures was negligible. The use of "acquire" would be a euphemism that would obscure rather than clarify how hisorians view the process of colonization today.[[User:Maunus|·maunus]] · [[User talk:Maunus|snunɐɯ·]] 08:26, 26 August 2015 (UTC)}}

The lede paragraph of the lead section currently refers to a theory that the murder was a murder for hire designed to appear to be a random carjacking.  Should that statement be excluded on the grounds that it gives [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]] to a theory that has since been at least partially discredited, since the primary suspect was formally acquitted on grounds of inadequate evidence to continue with trial?

'''Survey'''

'''Threaded Discussion'''

I will vote for "exclude" but that is mainly because I don't like the wording of the RFC. I think it requires a 3rd option - "include with qualification". Given the "murder for hire" theory was largely what gave this case a high profile, it does warrant mention in the lede, however it needs to be explicitly and unequivocally qualified by explaining that the theory was discredited. 

My suggested wording is below: 

"South African prosecutors formulated charges on the basis that she had been the victim of a premeditated kidnapping and murder for hire staged to appear as a random carjacking, at the alleged behest of her husband, Shrien Dewani. That theory was later discredited when Dewani was exonerated, the Western Cape High Court ruling that there was no credible evidence to support the allegations.[1]"

When looking through these two articles, I really couldn't help but notice the large amount of overlap between the two topics.  One might argue that this article is about the people, while the Anglo-Saxon England article is about the time period or history. However, the history sections in this article almost exactly overlap the other article in scope. Really, the only difference is that this article contains a brief summary of events after the Norman Conquest and discusses Anglo-Saxon culture. Since the Anglo-Saxons as a ''people'' are almost exclusively attached to their habitation of England, it makes sense that these articles should be one. The history sections would be merged, while the "After the Norman Conquest" section and all those below it could simply be cut and pasted into the other article. I realize the difficultly that might be involved while performing the merge, but I would be willing to help and I think it would ultimately be best to have one central overview article on the topic instead of two heavily overlapping ones.

== Leadership bloat '''

The whole section is getting grossly disproportionate. As noted in the some of the individual topic threads above by me and others, this is mean to be a long-term encyclopedia bio, not a blow-by-blow account of Corbyn's leadership bid or a daily news round-up service of who said what about it in the media. There's far too much detail on both his policy proposals and the reaction to both them and his bid as a whole, with people constantly adding more and more quotes from newspaper op-eds and other individual politicians (and mostly, as it happens, it's negative reaction being highlighted, which adds another layer to the problem). Even allowing for the fact that it's Corbyn's candidacy that has made this race what it is to some extent, just compare the sections on this in the other candidates' pages: [[Andy Burnham]], [[Liz Kendall]] and [[Yvette Cooper]]. They, by contrast, could probably be expanded slightly – Cooper's didn't have one at all until I moved some stuff from here to it the other day – but they're much more in proportion. If it's not culled now, it will certainly have to be in a year or so's time, whether he wins or not. For a start, I'd suggest people stop adding anything to it; and if it genuinely needs updating with more text, please trim something else to compensate. <small>'''[[User:N-HH|<font color="navy">N-HH</font>]]''' '''[[User talk:N-HH|<font color="blue">talk</font>]]/[[Special:Contributions/N-HH|<font color="blue">edits</font>]]'''</small> 17:24, 28 August 2015 (UTC)}}

Per [[WP:LEAD#Relative emphasis]], "Emphasis given to material should reflect its relative importance to the subject, according to published reliable sources." This applies to mentioning Matt Damon and Ridley Scott in the first sentence because they are the most important elements relative to the film. In addition, this also applies to why "U.S. production" is appropriately relegated to the second sentence. There is no actual "American film" label being used here as necessitated by [[WP:FILMLEAD]]; sources are instead calling it "a Ridley Scott film", so it is inappropriate to cast it as simplistically American. It is only appropriate to do that when the sources are very straightforward about that. This is less and less the case with internationally collaborative productions in the 21st century.

{{rfcquote|text=
There has been an extended discussion regarding the default colors for {{tl|Navbox}}. The crux of the issue whether or not the colors should be changed to satisfy AAA level color contrasts per [[WP:COLOR]]. Specifically, ensuring that the contrast ratio between the unvisited links font color ({{colorbox|#0645ad}}) and the background color is greater than or equal to 7:1. This RfC is being created as some expressed a desire for wider community input before implementing any changes to such a widely-used template.

The reason for meeting certain levels of contrast is to ensure accessibility for color-blind, low-vision, and vision-impaired users and readers. [[WP:COLOR]] says that, {{tq|"Ensure the contrast of the text with its background reaches at least WCAG 2.0's AA level, and AAA level when feasible."}} AA level is contrast greater than or equal to 4.5:1 which {{tq|"compensate[s] for the loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent to approximately 20/40 vision"}} and AAA level is contrast greater than or equal to 7:1 which {{tq|"compensate[s] for the loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent to approximately 20/80 vision"}} ([http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html]).

Below are the current template colors and the colors proposed above. Other proposal are welcome and people responding to this RfC should feel free to offer alternatives.
Current colors:

{{rfcquote|text=
As an extension of the [[Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)/Archive 140#HTTPS for selected external links, but how?|discussion on WP:VPT]], I decided to file this Request for Comments. The question is straightforward and has two parts:
:'''''“Should we convert existing Google and Internet Archive links to HTTPS, and is this protection of readers' privacy enough to merit a solitary edit?”'''''
The reason for this action is [https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/ Wikimedia's recent switch to HTTPS-by-default for all projects]. If we are truly concerned with readers' privacy as they enter Wikipedia, we should be equally concerned with it as they follow an external link that serves as a reference to what they just read. The issue concerns all existing external links to Google services ([[Google Books]], [[Google News]], [[YouTube]], etc.) and the Internet Archive domain (<code>*.archive.org</code>), and '''only''' those two, because Google Books, Google News and the Internet Archive's [[WP:WBM|Wayback Machine]] are among the most linked-to references on Wikipedia, with literally millions of external links.

'''Frequently Asked Questions:'''
* '''Won't this break existing links? What if the HTTPS version is different from the HTTP version?''' As far as Google and the Internet Archive are concerned, HTTP and HTTPS versions are identical. In fact, both services have switched to HTTPS-by-default years ago, and only maintain HTTP support to not break existing inbound links.
* '''This seems like a mere technicality. Why not just be bold and do it?''' I would like to and, in fact, I did just "do it" over the past months, until Wikibureaucracy stopped me. It was pointed out to me that the [[Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser#Rules of use|rules of AutoWikiBrowser]] do not allow "insignificant or inconsequential edits," so the question that needs to be addressed here also is whether securing readers' privacy is to be considered "significant" or not.
* '''I don't like HTTPS. Why did Wikipedia switch to HTTPS-by-default in the first place?''' Please do not make this debate a proxy war for an [[Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)/Archive 138#HTTPS by default|already settled issue]]. If you have questions about the purpose of HTTPS, please have a look at this [https://https.cio.gov/everything/ info website by the Federal CIO].

The rule on using alternative accounts in project space currently says {{!xt|[u]ndisclosed alternative accounts are not to be used in discussions internal to the project.}} I'd like to insert the word "disruptively" to clarify the sort of use that isn't allowed, so that the full rule would say that {{xt|[u]ndisclosed alternative accounts are not to be used <ins>disruptively</ins> in discussions internal to the project.}} The [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Privatemusings#Sockpuppetry|arbcom case]] that this bullet point cites specifically mentions sockpuppets instead of "undisclosed alternative accounts", although the latter wording was introduced a while ago to remove a circular definition. This change would make the policy inapplicable to a situation in which an editor uses a legitimate undisclosed alternative account (say, one made for privacy reasons) to participate in an internal discussion.

Further to the above discussion, should RDTs generally be converted to the Lua format, or left as they were originally created, with exceptions for those RDTs that either require a large number of columns or exceed template size limits.

The argument in favour of the change is mostly based on the time it takes to load the diagrams. In many cases, this is not an issue as diagrams generally are not so big as to seriously impede on page load times. The argument against the changes is that they are being brought in ''en masse'' without consensus for such change. Apart from the very few editors who have thought up this new system, nobody understands how it works. I tried editing one such template under the new system and couldn't work out what went where, let alone a simple action such as moving a line of text up one line.

Whilst this subject is under discussion, and as the new system is being ''challenged'', no existing RDTs should be changed, unless and until such time as there is consensus to do so. Editors who disregard this will be warned and blocked as necessary. [[User:Mjroots|Mjroots]] ([[User talk:Mjroots|talk]]) 17:38, 7 September 2015 (UTC)}}

Should [[WP:Artist's impressions of astronomical objects]] become a English Wikipedia guideline?

''Background:'' This proposal originated in early July with my removal of dozens of artist's impressions of exoplanets that I felt were not informative and potentially misleading. Another editor disputed one of these removals, and the ensuing discussion became [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Astronomy#Should_Artist.27s_Impression_images_that_be_used_on_Article_Pages.3F|an RfC at WikiProject Astronomy]]. My observation of the following features of that RfC convinced me of the utility of a new guideline on this question:
# There was a notable lack of consensus.
# There were well-reasoned arguments for several different positions, and these positions appeared to be based on differing but equally valid subjective judgments.
# The relevance of existing Wikipedia policies and guidelines to the question was unclear.
# There was a general sense that the discussion was important, that its outcome would affect the quality of the encyclopedia.
These observations led me to conclude that the default and preferred process of consensus through talk page discussion would be insufficient to decide the question of which artist's impressions should be used on Wikipedia. Accordingly, I drafted the guideline currently under consideration as a compromise based on the spirit of [[WP:OR]] and designed to best accommodate the range of justified opinions expressed in the RfC. The draft guideline was modified based on input from participants in the original RfC (most notably, it was extended from covering only exoplanets to covering all astronomical objects) and received generally positive responses. The end result of this process is what is now under consideration. [[User:A2soup|A2soup]] ([[User talk:A2soup|talk]]) 18:59, 1 September 2015 (UTC)}}

Hi all,

Following several recent discussions (including [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Official company accounts|this]], there has been some arguments presented against our current practice of blocking all usernames associated with companies in general. In order to help overcome this, and make it easier to disclose who edits for companies, and identify them on the articles they edit.

I'd like to propose that we follow a model similar to [[:de|dewiki]], which would mean we should change the policy to allow company names as usernames '''after''' they verify they represent the company, by sending an email from a work email address to a new [[WP:OTRS|OTRS]] address. A draft I'd like to propose that is used for this can be found at [[User:Mdann52/CoIdraft]]. Additionally, the volenteer handling this could then finish the on-wiki declaration on their User page, if the user does not understand or forgets to do this.

Thanks in advance, [[User:Mdann52|Mdann52]] ([[User talk:Mdann52|talk]]) 18:43, 1 September 2015 (UTC)}}

*'''Yes''' and '''Yes'''. All population estimates for languages are rough and error prone. The 80,000 based on an analogy with the estimated number of speakers of Danish traditional dialects - Denmark being demographically similar to Scania. There are no sources providing other figures. There are multiple sources reporting the number (without claiming that it is correct, but simply noting that the ethnologue gives the figure) including the Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages. If the figure is good enough to be reported by linguists writing in peer reviewed handbooks and journals then it is also good enough for Wikipedia.[[User:Maunus|·maunus]] · [[User talk:Maunus|snunɐɯ·]] 07:39, 2 September 2015 (UTC)}}

The claim has been made that there are too many sources from within the Waldorf movement. A request for examples was ignored, so that the claim has not been supported by a single concrete instance. 

As far as I can see, the citations in this article are all to [[WP:Reliable source]]s.

In the Orangemoody sockpuppet/paid editing fiasco socks were approaching AfC participants and claiming to be admins

Consider the following paragraph in the [http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/02/wikipedia-blocks-editor-accounts-linked-to-extortion-scam Guardian]:

"The Wikipedia Foundation said the accounts were blocked over “black hat” editing – charging money for the creation of promotional articles – amid allegations that hundreds of businesses and minor celebrities have been blackmailed by scammers posing as Wikipedia administrators."

It would be very good if we could tell everybody - including participants at WP:AFC, all our readers, and any journalists - that "admins are *not* allowed to accept payment for any services on Wikipedia.  Do not believe those who claim to be admins and ask for money."

This would be a bright line rule that would protect everybody involved, admins, the WMF, and the scam targets.

I am not accusing any admins of being paid editors, suggesting that admins were responsible for the Orangemoody fiasco, or singling out admins for criticism. This is just a simple way to stop future Orangemoodies.

Proposed text to be inserted at the bottom of the "Expectations of adminship" section

'''Payments not allowed'''

"No administrator may accept payment to edit articles or to perform any administrative function on Wikipedia. Admins who work for the the WMF or Wikimedia chapters are exempt when performing their duties for these organizations. Admins who work for other organizations which have missions that are aligned with the WMF mission, such as museums, libraries, universities and not-for-profit research centers, should declare a potential conflict of interest on their user pages and follow the [[WP:COI|conflict of interest guideline]] closely, but are also exempt when performing their duties for these organizations."

BTW, this proposal was developed at [[User:Doc James/Paid editing#16. Ban all Admins from paid editing]] and I will invite the participants there to comment here.

{{rfcquote|text=
The Terms of Use require people who receive/expect to receive consideration for editing, to disclose their "employer, client, and affiliation".   

Currently the policy explanation says:

*'''Employer''': the person or organization that pays a user to contribute to Wikipedia, whether that user has a freelance contract with the payer, has no contract, is a salaried employee of the payer, or is a salaried employee of another organization.
*'''Client''': the person or organization on whose behalf the edits are made; the client is often the subject of the article.
*'''Affiliation''': other connections that might be relevant.

Say that FreelancerA gets a job writing an article for ClientB through BrokerC (Elance, Upwork etc are brokers).  

In my view the policy explanation above should have two additions "Affiliation refers to other connections that might be relevant<u>, including any broker through which a paid editor contracted with his or her client</u> <u>and the paid editor's account name at the broker</u>."

Two questions:

# Should the explanation of "affiliation" include "<u>including any broker <u>(such as Elance or Upworks)</u> through which a paid editor contracted with his or her client</u>
# Should the explanation of "affiliation" ''also'' include "<u>and the paid editor's account name at the broker</u>"

{{rfcquote|text=
As of writing this there are no policies or guidelines on how we as editors are supposed to handle or deal with (suspected) paid editors.

Relating to the latest "paid editing scandal" that has developed, we helpers on IRC who meet multiple paid editors on a daily basis asking for help are wondering what the best practises are. Since the IRC logs in the help channel are forbidden to be logged and therefore can not be used to prove or disprove if someone is a paid editor, nor be used by us to prove that a user has disclosed off-wiki on their user page.

If we question a user, or believe that they are a paid editor (which happens a few times a day) but refuses to disclose such on his or her user page, what can or should we do? The user may or may not have disclosed that they are paid in the IRC-channel, which means that we may have serious beliefs that they are being paid, but we can not use such information to prove it, nor force them to disclose either.

When helping users on IRC, multiple users tend to be hired to edit a page, but have not disclosed such fact on their user page. Almost all helpees, as they are called, have a COI when writing, but not everybody is a paid editor or let this on in the IRC-channel. So, to differentiate between a "normal" {{abbr|COI|COnflict of Interest}}-editor and a paid editor is really hard. However, if the user discloses sush information in the IRC-channel, it is pertinent that we ask the user to do so. If said user refuses to respond to these requests, then the problem gets … problematic.

What should a user (helper as they are called on IRC) do? Should s/he report the user to the {{abbr|CA|Community Advocacy}}-team at the WMF for violating the ToU, to the ArbCom to get them involved some how? Is there a warning/notification template to issue (suspected) paid editors to get them to disclose?

{{Quote2|Except in exceptional cases, the Wikimedia Foundation does not interfere in the daily governance of the projects, so they are not a good first recourse [to report users].|Maggie Dennis ({{noping|Mdennis (WMF)}}), Director, Community Advocacy, Wikimedia Foundation}}

There are a lot of questions, and not a lot of answers.

What is most needed are some guidelines. Some best practises which users can follow. Such as:
# If found eveidence, or suspicion without a doubt, that they are a paid editor, notify the user on their user talk page that they need to disclose such information before editing, with e.g. {{tl|Paid}}.
# If the user does not disclose such information, within one week, or has made more than five edits within since the message was left on the user's talkpage, send an email with your evidence and/or why you believe the user is a paid editor to the ArbCom.

These are just ideas to get the ball rolling, these are not what I suggest or anything, but something is needed, that much is sure. That's why I am starting this {{abbr|RfC|Request for Comments}} to get your input on how to deal with these situations.

I hope everybody can understand what I'm trying to ask about here. If not, feel free to ask.

I think a RfC is needed here, and I think that anyone who reads the below paragraph will agree. I see much debate but the paragraph still stands in the article. I will try to present it in a neutral way by stating the issue, and each side's sources and brief argumentation. 

This is the paragraph: ''"Amid political changes during the breakup of Yugoslavia and following the Croatian Democratic Union's victory in the 1990 general election, the Croatian Parliament ratified a new constitution in December 1990 which changed the status of Serbs from a constitutional nation to a national minority, listed with other minorities. A majority of Serb politicians have misread this as taking away some of the rights from the Serbs granted by the previous Socialist constitution,[40] because the Constitution of SR Croatia treated solely Croats as a constitutive nation. Croatia was the "national state" for Croats, "state" for Serbs and other minorities."''

{{collapse top}}

I think that the issue is obvious, but I will restate it. The first sentence says:'''"new constitution in December 1990 changed the status of Serbs from a constitutional nation to a national minority"''', while the very next sentence says:'''"the Constitution of SR Croatia treated solely Croats as a constitutive nation"'''. That is a clear contradiction. The paragraph is also written in a very confusing way even without that contradiction.

'''The dispute is the following. Were the Serbs a "constitutive nation" in Socialist Croatia?'''
'''The following question is also interesting from Wiki's point of view to the sources. In the above discussion editors have presented a great number of sources that simply state the fact that the "Serbs were constitutive nation in Croatia", without any elaboration or any reference to the primary source. On the other hand, a source that says otherwise gives much wider elaboration and references the primary source. So the question is (as I see it), which bears more weight, quantity or quality?'''

Here is the primary source [https://www.pravo.unizg.hr/_download/repository/Ustav_Socijalisticke_RH_1974.pdf]. Unfortunately it isn't in English.

The first thing to notice from the primary source is that the paragraph speaks of the "constitutive nations" while the primary source does not contain any mention of that term. This is also stated in one of the secondary sources listed below.

The first side's secondary sources state: 
:(1) "the equality of the Serbian and the Croatian nations, as constituent nations of the federal unit of Croatia, were recognized in every respect"
:(2) "The secessionist Zagreb regime first removed from the Croatian Constitution the constituent nation status of Serbs living in Croatia"
:(3) "Since the constitution of the Yugoslavian Federation regarded the Serbs in Croatia as constituent nation of the Republic of Croatia"
:(4) "Serbs living in Croatia had been members of a constituent nation while Croatia was part f Yugoslavia" -> this one in my opinion doesn't go along with the rest of sources from this group, but the source which goes against this group of sources
:(5) "The international recognition of Croatia, as well as documents adopted by the Croatian Administration prior to the recognition, stripped the Serbs from Croatia from their status of constituent nation and active subject in decisions concerning the Constitution of Croatian State, and specially the status of Serbs in it. What does this mean? It means primarily that the Serbs in Croatia have been down-graded from nation to national minority, or to use a new European euphemism - an ethnic community."
:(6) ".previously a constituent nation in the Republic of Croatia enjoying equal constitutional status alongside the Croats, the Serbs were now relegated to the category of other nations and minorities"
:(7) "Croatian nationalist Franjo Tuđman in 1990 brought a new constitution that proclaimed that ethnic Serbs would become a national minority rather than a constituent nation within an independent Croatia."
:(8) "the original draft of the Croatian constitution did not recognize the Serbian minority as a constituent nation - a right they had during the days of communism"
:(9) "It also changed the status of Serbs from a constituent nation in Croatia into a minority"
:(10) "Previously a constituent nation in the Republic of Croatia and enjoying equal constitutional status alongside the Croats, the Serbs were now relegated to the category of other nations and minorities."
:(11) "The new Croatian constitution ... renounced the hitherto protected status of ethnic Serbs as a separate constituent nation embedded in the old constitution and defined Croatia as the sovereign state of Croatian nation."

The first side's arguments are: 
:(1) The majority of sources say that Serbs were a constitutive nation, while there is only one source that says otherwise. 
:(2) The only source that says otherwise is Croatian, so it is prone to be biased
:(3) "Croatian authors doing their best to deny that Serbs were constitutional nation in Croatia prior to 1990"

My note: I couldn't find further arguments that the Croatian source is biased, or unreliable, apart from the quote stated under number (3)

The second side's secondary sources:

:(1) "The accusation that the Croatian government allegedly wanted to oust the Serbs from the constitution of Republic of Croatia are also followed by the accusation that with the adoption of the amendments and the constitution of Croatia in December 22nd 1990 they allegedly lost the constitutionality in Croatia. The chronology of the events during the period from the first announcements about the adoption of the new Croatian constitution shows that the thesis about the announcement of 'ousting' of the Serbs does not stand. There is no doubt that these were accusations which had to justify further extremist action of the SDS in Croatia pointed against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia. Thesis about the loss of constitutionality would then allude that such a thing until then existed, apropos that it was defined by the provisions of the constitution of SRC. Analysis of that constitution shows that was not the case. First we should emphasize that the very term "constitutionality" was not even used anywhere in it. In it's Chapter 1 SRC is defined as 'national state of Croatian people, state of Serbian people in Croatia and state of nationalities which live in it'. The claim that SRC is a national state of Croatian people and state of other nations and nationalities who live in it is strengthened by the provisions from the General Principle of the constitution SRC, passage I, in which it is found that 'Croatian people, along with Serbian nation and nationalities in Croatia, (...), won (...) in a common struggle with other nations and nationalities of Yugoslavia in a liberation war and socialist revolution it's national freedom, (...), and founded it's state - Socialist Republic of Croatia (...)'. The quoted text undoubtedly and in singular terms marks specifically Croatian people as the ones who established the SRC. According to that fact it [SRC] was defined as a national state of only one nation, the Croatian nation. The Serbian nation was however emphasized, but regardless of that the mentioned definition did not mark the SRC as the national state of Serbian people. Only then such a definition could be accepted as proof that Serbian people in Croatia were constitutional. Also we should caution about the use of the terms 'nation' and 'nationality' in the constitution. Namely, neither the constitution of the SRC, nor the constitution of the SFRY (also from 1974) did not have the term 'national minority' (or other similar terms for the denotation of a national minority). The exception from that rule is the formulation in section VII of the General Principle of the constitution of the SFRY from 1974, in which it states that the SFRY advocates for 'respecting the rights of national minorities, including the rights of the peoples of Yugoslavia who live in other countries as national minorities'. Considering that the entire section VII refers to international relations, it is reasonable to assume that the terms used within it were those used in international law. In the SFRY the status of 'nations' consisted of the members of those peoples whose national states were within it's composition: Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians, Montenegrins and Muslims. So Macedonians, Slovenes, Muslims and Montenegrins also had the status of nations in the SR Croatia, as in all other federal republics, regardless of their numbers, traditional presence and similar cases. Members of all other nations, whose home national states were outside the composition of the SFRY, had the status of 'nationalities', also regardless of their numbers and other significant factors. So it could happen that Albanians, who made up a large majority of Kosovo (and also constituting a large portion of the Macedonian and Montenegrin population), had the status of nationalities, while the far less numerous Montenegrins and Macedonians had the status of nations. Otherwise the constitution of the SFRY from 1974 does not define the terms "nation", and "nationalities" respectively. Formulation in the introductory portion of that part of the constitution, in General terms, Chapter I, says that the nations of Yugoslavia, together with the nationalities with which they live, united in a federal republic of free and equal nations and nationalities, points to the fact that nations were considered those whose people had national states as part of the SFRY as it's national republics. The exception were the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Considering that five republics were at the same time national states of one of the nations in the SFRY, and that Bosnia-Herzegovina was constitutionally defined as a tri-nation state (the state of Muslims, Croats and Serbs), it is very easy to come to a conclusion as to what are the 'nations of Yugoslavia', and what are nationalities. The terms "nation" and "nationalities", and their respective languages, were very precisely defined in the encyclopedic footnote to 'Yugoslavia', in the chapter written by August Kovacec, 'Languages and alphabets of nations and nationalities' (Encyclopedia of Yugoslavia, volume 6, Jap-Kat, zagreb 1990., pages 241-251). The term 'minority' was introduced only with the constitution of December 22 1990. The basic principles of that constitution talk about the Republic of Croatia as the 'national state of Croatian people', which is identical to the formulation from the constitution of the SRC from 1974. In continuation of that formulation also stands that the Republic of Croatia is a 'state of members of other nations and minorities, which are its citizens: Serbs, Muslims, Slovenes, Czechs, Slovaks (...)'. Serbs in Croatia (this time defined as citizens of Croatia) were put first in the list, and 'nations and minorities' are explicitly mentioned. So it would be logical to conclude that Serbs (and not just Serbs) were considered a nation. They were treated in the same way as in the constitution from 1974, and the only difference is that other nations and minorities were mentioned as well. 'Mean' interpretations of their dissatisfaction could lead us to the conclusion that the leaders of Serbs in Croatia and their numerous followers were bothered that besides them other nations and nationalities were mentioned. And according with that we could also be 'naughty' and conclude that such 'real' Serbs held that they were more important than all others, which would give us a completely new light on their complaints about the loss of their rights. Also we should notice that the Basic Principles of the constitution of Croatia from 1990 can also be compared with the Basic Principles from the constitution of the SRC from 1974. It is important to emphasize that in those parts of these two constitutions the basic constitutional principles are only hinted at, which are more detailed in the continuation of the text of the constitution, in their normative parts. We should also emphasize the fact that the formulation about national self-determination in the constitution of the SRC was also an integral part of the General Principle (in Chapter I) and a normative part of the Constitution (Head 1). In the constitution from December 22 1990 formulation about national self-determination is present only in the Basic principle, while the normative part does not contain anything similar. That part speaks explicitly about the general rights of all citizens, and in chapter 14 it explicitly states that citizens of Croatia 'have all rights and liberties, regardless of their race, skin color, gender, language, religion, political or other conviction, national or social conviction (...).' In chapter 15 it states that in Croatia 'members of all nations and minorities are equal', and to all of them 'the freedom of expression of their national affiliation, free use of their language and scripture, including cultural autonomy' is guaranteed. In chapter 12 is guaranteed that along with the Croatian language and Latin alphabet 'in official use (...) other languages and Cyrillic script or any other script, could be introduced, under the condition of prescribed law'. I consider that the comparison of the solutions in the two mentioned constitutions shows that Serbs in Croatia had no reason to be dissatisfied with the new constitutional amendments, but that the reasons for their rebellion and later aggression of YNA and Serbian paramilitary groups in Croatia should be looked at in other places"

Second side's arguments:
:(1) The first group of sources simply states the fact without further elaboration or any reference to the primary source
:(2) Although there is a majority that states otherwise, the quality of those sources is much less than the quality of this source which gives much wider elaboration and references the primary source. 

Lastly, I'm sorry if I neglected some of the arguments or anything else. I haven't read the debate too carefully so I may have omitted something. In that case it would be advisable to add the omitted parts in a concise way.

Since the acquisition of [[UTV Motion Pictures]] in India in 2012, Disney has been increasingly releasing Indian language films (mainly Hindi) under the Disney banner not only in India but internationally. [[The Walt Disney Company (India)]] is a subsidiary of [[The Walt Disney Company]] however the films are clearly released and marketed under an identical Disney logo e.g. see [[Khoobsurat (2014 film)]] and [[ABCD 2]]. The article states that "This list is only for theatrical films released under the Disney banner" however does not include any subsidiaries owned by Walt Disney Studios. It does however contain Pixar films and Walt Disney Animation Studios which are subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company, which makes things confusing. 
On the 1st of October, an anonymous user with ip 65.129.93.104 removed my addition of the film ABCD 2 to the List of Walt Disney Pictures films page claiming "For the last time, that is not released by American Disney. It was released by Indian disney".  The films Khoobsurat and Arjun: The Warrior Prince however are also released by Disney India and remain on the list however.
# Which theatrical films of subsidiaries of Disney should be included in the list?
# Should Indian language films produced by The Walt Disney Company globally should be included in the list?

I think, English Wikipedia has sadly mistaken on this and need to correct this on priority. The experts on Wikipedia may show the references of book and encyclopedia. But we should also honor what is mentioned in the Hindu calendar, Hindu Panchang and Hindu Mythology. We should also respect what 125 Crores of Indians follow. We should not get dragged just on the references. We should respect to the views of Indian people also.

In short, we need to have separate article of all the above days. [[User:Yogee23|Yogee23]] ([[User talk:Yogee23|talk]]) 09:22, 8 September 2015 (UTC)}}

Hey all,

I'm starting this discussion as this issue does affect this site. Recently, there has been some internal discussion within OTRS about what to do when subjects send in copies of primary sources (such as scans of passports or driving licences), and whether these can be used to source information such as dates of birth on articles. The main areas of dispute is whether such documents fall under [[WP:SOURCE]] as unpublished, or whether it makes sense to [[WP:IAR]] and add them. Of course, any such uses can be verified at [[WP:OTRSN]]. Thanks, [[User:Mdann52|Mdann52]] ([[User talk:Mdann52|talk]]) 15:36, 7 October 2015 (UTC)}}

In the template "cite web", which is used when "cite news", "cite newspaper" or "cite journal" is not, should the "website" field italicize the name of websites, in the manner of books or periodicals?

*'''Oppose''' No mainstream source italicizes British Board of Film Classification, U.S. State Department, Sears, Rotten Tomatoes, New York State Department of Motor Vehicles or other entities. Indeed, none of these entities themselves italicize their names on their own websites. These aren't publications, and we have templates like "cite newspaper" that we use for publications. It seems eccentric to use a citation format virtually no one else uses, and it also seems inconsistent that a movie article, for example, would mention Rotten Tomatoes in text but call it ''Rotten Tomatoes'' in a footnote. --[[User:Tenebrae|Tenebrae]] ([[User talk:Tenebrae|talk]]) 16:50, 9 September 2015 (UTC)}}

So far numerous editors have pointed out that [[Hijra (Islam)|The Hijra]] is [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC|<u>the</u> Hijra]]. Fixing the current misplacement has been supported by the few people who visit a dab's talk page, except for [[User:Cnilep|Cnilep]].

Cnilep is simply wrong. '''The Islamic migration to Medina is and will remain ''far'' more notable and central to worldwide English readership'''. Perfectly correct that [https://www.google.com/search?q=hijra+-Wikipedia vanilla] & [https://www.google.com/search?q=hijra+-Wikipedia&tbm=bks book] Google searches for "Hijra" tend to discuss the Indian gender. However, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=hijra+-wikipedia the Islamic usage crushes others in Scholar] and that points to the problem. The editors here got ahead of themselves moving away from the {{sc|english}} {{sc|commonname}} of the Hegira. Hegira links directly here: [https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=hegira+-Wikipedia Google shows the Islamic usage crushing any others]. Hijrah links directly here: [https://www.google.com/search?q=hijrah+-wikipedia Google shows the Islamic usage crushing any others].

It's probably valid that the spelling Hijra ''isn't'' used in English for the Islamic migration except among specialists. Doesn't matter. As long as ''our'' article on it is at "Hijra" and "Hegira" and "Hijrah" are pointing at "Hijra", it ''is'' the {{sc|primarytopic}} and we need to stop forcing users to type needless title dabs in their links and endure additional click-throughs to get to the topic they're looking for.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User talk:LlywelynII|<span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em; class=texhtml">Llywelyn<font color="Gold">II</font></span>]] 12:53, 10 September 2015 (UTC)}}

* RFC Text:

Please comment on the need to restructure the three overlapping and jumbled articles (previously proposed at [[Talk:State of Palestine/Restructuring proposal]]): 
* [[State of Palestine]]
* [[Palestinian territories]] and 
* [[Palestinian National Authority]]

The particular issues to be resolved are:
* All three contain largely overlapping detailed sections on History and Politics
* The SoP article does not contain a number of sections which would be usual for a country article, such as: 
:::(1) Geography and Administrative Divisions (currently in PT and PNA)
:::(2) Demographics (currently in PT and PNA)
:::(3) Foreign relations (currently in PNA)
:::(4) Communications and Transportation (currently in PNA)

Please comment on the proposal to move these sections between the different articles to create more cohesive and focused articles.

== Very biased section of the article '''

"Teachings, interpretations, and practices" needed to be removed or heavily edited. First, it is incorrect to make the page on "Buddhism and violence" about general principles about Buddhism. Secondly, "Teachings, interpretations, and practices" is adopts an apologist tone throughout. It is akin to having a list of Christian examples of compassion, Jesus helping others, etc., in an article about Christianity and Violence.

For instance: 
"In various instances Buddhist extremists called for violence and demonized others which is against the teaching of right speech." This is a philosophical/theological position. The sentence presupposes that someone is able to criticize some Buddhists as being against "core teachings" of Buddhism (i.e., they are not Buddhist). There is no authority that can be cited to justify this stance, as there is no unified Buddhism (like that of the Roman Catholic Church for Catholicism).

I have retained most of the material and placed it after the main material that deals with violence, re-labeling it as "Doctrinal Sources against Violence." It is still heavily biased to have such a section (on sources "against" violence in a section ON violence), unless we have another section that goes over the sources that support violence. There are quite a few, as noted by Stephen Jenkins, Michael Zimmermann, Michael Jerryson, Matthew King, and many other scholars of Buddhism.

I highly recommend that someone create another section to balance this page-- and provide some representation of doctrinal sources in support of violence.

"Teachings, interpretations, and practices" needed to be removed and/or heavily edited. First, it is incorrect to make the page on "Buddhism and violence" about general principles about Buddhism-- let alone START the page with this section. Secondly, "Teachings, interpretations, and practices" adopts an apologist tone throughout. Teachings, interpretations, and practices are GENERAL terms, that would reflect ALL sides of an argument. This is not the case. 

Furthermore, the inclusion of this section at any point of the page is akin to having a list of Christian examples of compassion, Jesus helping others, etc., in an article about Christianity and Violence.

Currently, the section is a collection of cherry-picked passages without context or indication of authority. Some Buddhist traditions do not acknowledge some texts, whereas others do. Some Buddhist Traditions see some texts as central to their doctrine and other texts as peripheral. There is nothing in this litany of examples.

Much more, the use of grandiose statements like Buddhist claims against hurtful speech or violence would mirror that of any global religion. Islam, Christianity, Judaism, all have general prohibitions on violence. This is not the point of this page-- to convince people of these general claims, but rather to look at the relevance of violence in Buddhism.  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.72.5.6|71.72.5.6]] ([[User talk:71.72.5.6|talk]]) 22:43, 20 September 2015 (UTC)}}

Notwithstanding the fact that it may be possible that the clock was built from parts of a commercially available clock, the lead should not make statements of fact based on the unattributed opinions of a few bloggers and commentators, which in turn were all based on a low resolution photo released by police. The assessments and viewpoints of the clock in the photo, as well as comments by the main actor in this incident, are better left to be presented and attributed in the article's body. -  [[User:Cwobeel|<span style="color:#339966">Cwobeel</span>]] [[User_talk:Cwobeel|<span style="font-size:80%">(talk)</span>]] 02:37, 26 September 2015 (UTC)}}

The Myspace image has been widely used in media coverage, and even if he is dead, he would still own the copyright on the image if he took it himself.[https://www.legallanguage.com/resources/copyright/copyright-protection-endurance/] The fair use argument is open to debate as people have different views on how strictly this should be interpreted.

====Policy'''

While not getting into the issue of reverting edits without first reaching out to the original editor to understand their motivation (in this case, the deletion of a table), [[User:Earl Andrew|Earl Andrew]] justifies the reversion of my deletion by pointing to other articles with the same flawed table...which he created!

Examples:
<br>
<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Papineau_%28electoral_district%29&diff=prev&oldid=654041277 - the above article<br/>
<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ottawa_South&diff=prev&oldid=593333525 - [[Ottawa South]]<br/>
<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edmonton_Strathcona&diff=636097681&oldid=622403799 - [[Edmonton Strathcona]]<br/>
<br>
While we're on this topic, I found an identical table with identical formatting and citation in [[Toronto Centre]]...but added by [[User: Fungus Guy|Fungus Guy]]!
<br>
<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Toronto_Centre&oldid=670004225<br/>

This strikes me as possible sock puppetry.  I'm hoping a more sophisticated WP editor can either confirm or deny my hypothesis.

Earl Andrew already admitted to working as a polling firm employee in Ottawa. It seems likely the same user is responsible not only for adding the content cited, but actually ''generating'' it in meatspace.  This in itself wouldn't make the content non-NPOV, though one has to wonder why Earl Andrew guards Canadian electoral district pages so jealously (including the "Political Geography" sections which he invented, the topic of our last edit war).  Articles about Canadian electoral districts are not Earl Andrew's soapbox and should not be treated as such.

Further, in the edit history of every single article mentioned above (only a handful, but statistically, that makes the following more damning), Earl Andrew and Fungus Guy are responsible for the lion's share of edits. While I understand that topics as specialized as Canadian politics may have only a handful of active editors, this appears to be a suspicious pattern and should be treated with all due seriousness.

*'''move from results''' It's not a result, it doesn't belong in results. It could be interesting to a discussion of the redistribution but labelling it a result is misapplication of the source. [[User:SPACKlick|SPACKlick]] ([[User talk:SPACKlick|talk]]) 10:16, 14 September 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I propose renaming this article to '''Special administrative regions of China'''. My reasoning for this is:<br/>
1. Some other nations have their own 'special administrative regions' (one inspired by the Chinese SARs exists in North Korea and is the primary basis for this side of the argument) or may use similar terminology to refer to select administrative divisions.<br/>
2. The name is inconsistent with the article names for other Chinese administrative divisions (i.e. [[Administrative divisions of China]], [[Provinces of China]], [[Autonomous regions of China]], etc.). Pluralisation of the article name is also highly important as there is definitely more than one SAR in China and it keeps consistency.

I personally believe the current article name is too general, and the proposed name is not only keeps consistency with other similar articles, it also removed any possible confusion with any other regions referred to by a similar name.

So some history on this template. Originally there were Multiple different templates, one for each year. For example {{tl|2014 California wildfires}}:

{{Navbox
| name  = 2014 California wildfires
| title = [[2014 California wildfires]]
| listclass = hlist
| state = expanded
| group1 = 
| list1  =
* [[Colby Fire|Colby]] 
* [[King Fire|King]] 
* [[Meadow Fire|Meadow]]
* [[Shirley Fire|Shirley]]

| below = {{icon|category}} '''[[:Category:2014 California wildfires|Category]]''' {{bull}} {{icon|commons}} '''[[commons:Category:2014 California wildfires|Commons]]'''
}}

As the pages grew, it was suggested by many editors, including (I believe) {{u|Alakzi}} and {{u|SounderBruce}} that these be merged into one template. (I don't feel like tracking down the link to that discussion at the moment...) After a discussion a CONSENSUS was reached to merge them. Thus the current incarnation of {{tl|California wildfires}} was born. It serves TWO purposes. 
# The top part was meant for pages in the [[:Category:Wildfires in California by year|Wildfires in California by year]] category, which are list pages (such as [[2015 California wildfires]]). 
# The bottom part was meant for individual fire pages. ([[Rim Fire]] or [[Valley Fire]]).

The current question is '''''Should the top section, lists by year, be removed?''''' I believe there are 3 options....
# Leave it as it is.
# Remove it, (the years are after all duplicated in the left side of the second section).
# Remove it from THIS template, BUT create a second navbox called {{tl|California wildfires by year}} that JUST contains that top section.

Summary: The stable version of the article for 3 weeks included a controversy over train employees running away. The owners of the article, Pincrete and others, appear to hate Anglade and want to gut it. I propose a compromise medium length version. The controversy is real as it was widely reported worldwide. The gutted version doesn't convey the controversy that happened.

Flag use or not?  See above.

Should we separate the incident and put some stuff, like the train crew running away, at the end separated from the article or is a more logical chronological style better. You could put a few facts chronologically and then have an analysis at the end.

In U.S. history, that would be like having a chronological history and not excluding World War II for the end.  

For example...History of the USA 1776-1941 and 1945-2015, then discussion of geography and transportation and education then stick in history from 1941-1945.

I just now realized that a lot of editors have mixed up two books of Dinesh D'Souza. He has two books titled Illiberal Education, with the political correctness one released in 1992. The 1991 book doesn't contain the term even once.
I have multiple sources which use the term in 1991, before he ever did:
http://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/05/us/political-correctness-new-bias-test.html "Published: May 5, 1991"


http://www.heritage.example.org/research/lecture/political-correctness-and-the-suicide-of-the-intellect "June 26, 1991"



'''In fact, the popularizer of the term is most likely the 41st president of the United States, [[George H. W. Bush]]''':

http://www.springerin.at/dyn/heft_text.php?textid=1599&lang=en

{{Quote frame|So when the U.S. President George Bush, Snr., declared from the right in 1991 that »the notion of political correctness has ignited controversy across the land« (Aufderheide, 1992: 227) left activists were puzzled, affirming no such notion or noun.}}

The NY times article above also refers to this speech by the president.


The sources referring to Dinesh D'Souza talk about his 1991 book. In the main source used, Schultz, Debra L. (1993). "To Reclaim a Legacy of Diversity: Analyzing the 'Political Correctness' Debates in Higher Education," the book being referred to is:
{{Quote frame|Dinesh D'Souza's Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Class on Campus (1991)}}


The 1992 book is 32 pages long and only seems to be based on a speech of his. I think this is the entirety of it:
http://ashbrook.org/publications/illiberal-education/




Here are some other sources that used it in 1991 or before:

To my humble opinion, a large part of this article could be removed, since it duplicates several other articles ([[Spirituality]], [[Nondualism]]), and is merely about modern western esotericism c.q. perennialism c.q. spirituality: the idea that all religions share a common, nondual "centre," which can be accessed by socalled "religious experiences." The part to be removed are:

* [[Mysticism#Forms of mysticism within world religions]], with the exclusion of [[Mysticism#Christian mysticism]], [[Mysticism#Jewish mysticism]], and [[Mysticism#Islamic mysticism]];

{{rfcquote|text=
I propose that [[Wikipedia:Non-free content review]] be shut down as historical while referring editors to use [[Wikipedia:Files for deletion]] as an alternative. At the present time, there are 163 open discussions on [[WP:NFCR]] with the oldest discussion opened on 10 June 2015 (over three months ago.) The fact of the matter is that [[WP:FFD]] can and should be utilized in place of [[WP:NFCR]] for multiple reasons:
#On [[WP:NFCR]], if a file is deemed to be used that is inappropriate, the file should be deleted (an outcome at [[WP:FFD]]). Files on [[WP:NFCR]] will be kept for the opposite reasons (also an outcome at [[WP:FFD]].)
#Discussions at [[WP:FFD]] can question a file's non-free status, and if it is improperly used, it should be deleted.
#[[WP:NFCR]] does not have daily subpages (and seemingly never has), which causes inability to visualize and work on backlogs. On the other hand, [[WP:FFD]] has daily subpages and a backlog notification that accurately appears if there are entries existing more than 7 days old; in addition, the bit management and organization of [[WP:FFD]] is a lot more advanced in making it clearer what needs to be closed when.
#For someone questioning if a non-free file should remain in Wikipedia (aka, should it be deleted), it is honestly very unclear whether the discussion should go to [[WP:FFD]] or [[WP:NFCR]].
#The concern regarding if [[WP:NFCR]] should still be functional has been discussed previously: see [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Non-free content review]]. The discussion happened back in 2012, and the discussion was closed with the suggestion to go to other pages to develop a consensus on what to do with [[WP:NFCR]]. Since that date, there has seemingly not been very minor, if any, updates to [[WP:NFCR]] that better distinguishes it from [[WP:FFD]]. (Thus, this is why this discussion is happening here.)
Very simply put, if a non-free file is not used per [[WP:NFCC]], the file should be deleted immediately. The purpose of [[WP:FFD]] is to determine if a file needs to be deleted. However, there is another point from the the MFD discussion above that needs to be considered during this discussion:<blockquote>What if the non-free file is used in multiple articles, and the question is if it should be removed from one article and not the other?</blockquote> For this question, I recommend that [[WP:FFD]] be updated to allow an outcome that specifically states that the image "should be kept, but removed from '''this article'''". This will benefit closes if these discussions happen on [[WP:FFD]] since it could be possible that during the course of the discussion, a non-free file that is on multiple articles but is nominated to be removed from only one article could very well be determined needed to be removed from Wikipedia altogether (which results in the file being deleted.) On a minor distracting note, if this change were to be made to the possible [[WP:FFD]] close results, the page may need to be renamed from [[Wikipedia:Files for deletion]] to [[Wikipedia:Files for discussion]] since the nomination purpose and outcome could then be something other than deletion. (This idea is similar to the fact that [[WP:RFD]] is named "Wikipedia:Redirects for '''discussion'''" instead of "Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion" since pages are nominated there for reasons other than deletion.)

We used to redirect specific month articles (like [[January 2014]]) to the appropriate section of the year article (for example, [[2014#January]]), but it seems that at some point we started recycling the [[Portal:Current events]] archives into actual Wikipedia articles about those months, with pretty much no modification. It even says on the articles that they are just archives of [[Portal:Current events]]. This seems problematic for several reason:
* They are not written according to Wikipedia's guidelines for articles. For example, they use inline external links instead of references.
* The mentions of [[Portal:Current events]] are probably against [[MOS:SELFREF]].
* If you try to look at them on a mobile device, they are a mess (as the formatting of [[Portal:Current events]] is designed for desktop).
* They divert traffic and editing attention away from the year articles, which are more encyclopedic and written according to our guidelines.
On the other hard, by recycling [[Portal:Current events]], we surface more information about the events of that month than we would by just redirecting to the year article (which is more strictly curated and limited).

'''Situation:''' The [[Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide|DYK Reviewing Guide]] currently requires editors to (1) complete a seven-part review of DYK nominees, and, (2) write a review. The form of the review, as required by the guide, must begin with "one of the five DYK review icons" and contain a "thorough explanation of any problems or concerns you have." The guide does not require a "thorough explanation" of the review process in the absence of "problems or concerns." Some editors have suggested all DYK reviews should explain, in detail, the methodology of the review conducted, and should include a full list of each of the seven criteria and explicit statement that each criterion was passed. Other editors have said, in the case of "no issue" noms, that blanket statements such as "all DYK criteria have been met" are acceptable. 
'''Question:''' Should the DYK Guide be amended to require all reviewers provide an in-depth description of their reviewing methodology instead of the status quo which only requires a "thorough explanation of any problems or concerns"? (exact format to be decided if proposal passes)

'''Question''': Are [[Wikipedia:"In popular culture" content|"in popular culture" entries]] self-sourcing, or do they require a reference under [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]] and [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources]]? 

*'''Reference is required'''. This RfC stems from a difference of opinion between [[User:Beyond My Ken|Beyond My Ken]] and me over the inclusion of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manhattan_Municipal_Building&type=revision&diff=683068131&oldid=683064913 particular non-referenced entries in an "in popular culture"] section, but has a broader bearing on WP:V and other policies. BMK believes that such entries should be included; I believe that some reference is required. [[Wikipedia:"In popular culture" content]] (an essay), says:
::''Although some references may be plainly verified by primary sources, this does not demonstrate the significance of the reference. Furthermore, when the primary source in question only presents the reference, interpretation of this may constitute original research where the reference itself is ambiguous. If a cultural reference is genuinely significant it should be possible to find a reliable secondary source that supports that judgment.''
:This seems to be completely consistent with the principles of [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]] and [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources]], which emphasize the need for verification, a strong preference for secondary rather than primary sources in most circumstances (especially when the primary source is being used outside of an article about itself), and the [[WP:BURDEN]] principle, that the editor restoring challenged unsourced content has the burden of providing references. Moreover, "self-sourcing" in "pop culture" entries would also seem to directly lead (1) to [[Wikipedia:original research|original research]] and [[wikipedia:synthesis|synthesis]], since the editor could add content to an "in pop culture" section in the absence of any genuine source that actually draws a connection with the new content to the article topic; and (2) to an increase in [[Wikipedia:trivia sections|trivia sections]], which we have long disapproved of (and leads to ridiculous outcomes, as [https://xkcd.com/446/ this xkcd comic spoofs]).  In essence, we should not have a more lenient rule for "in pop culture" sections than for other types of content.

[[WP:NOTCHANGELOG]] tells us to avoid describing software updates using primary sources, yet we have longstanding article sections and entire articles devoted to doing just that, listing new features and other changes (or just copying the official description), often without ''any'' citations. Examples include the tables at [[iOS version history]], [[Adobe Photoshop version history]], [[Palm OS#Version history and technical background]], and until a few months ago every article listed at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Xbox One system software]]—even [[MediaWiki version history]].

Does NOTCHANGELOG need to be updated to reflect practice? Or are these listings unacceptable? If [[WP:IAR|ignoring this rule improves the encyclopedia]] in all these cases (in every case?), why have the rule at all?

I am proposing that (i) the reporting of the latest genetics research of Indian populations be limited to the page on ''Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia'' and that (ii) this page be ''indefinitely semi-protected''. No other page on Indian populations should use primary sources on genetic research.

Rationale: The research into the genetic analysis of Indian populations is moving at a rapid pace and many new results are becoming available. However, the field is fluid, the available literature is mostly [[WP:PRIMARY|primary]], and its interpretation and verification is difficult. [[WP:NOR]] advises us that ''Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources and, to a lesser extent, on tertiary sources and primary sources''. [[WP:USEPRIMARY]] further clarifies that ''In science, data is primary, and the first publication of any idea or experimental result is always a primary source.'' At present, we have had such primary sources being used in [[Indo-Aryan peoples]], [[Dravidian peoples]], [[Adivasi]] and perhaps other pages. Often the same text is copied from one page to another. A number of unregistered users with dynamic IP addresses have been involved in the creation of this content, and they have left no reasonable edit summaries and showed no participation in talk page discussions. Limiting this content to [[Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia]] will ensure that it will be reviewed by editors knowledgeable about the subject and we do not have questionable claims being propagated throughout Indian population pages. - [[User:Kautilya3|Kautilya3]] ([[User talk:Kautilya3|talk]]) 19:33, 12 October 2015 (UTC)}}

I am reigniting this discussion in hopes that a page move will result.

Page move: '''[[Tudor dynasty]] → {{no redirect|1=House of Tudor}}'''

# This article is the only one located at "_____ dynasty" whereas all other articles for British (and by extension English and Scottish) royal houses are located at "House of _____".
# There is a category named "[[:Category:House of Tudor]]", but no such category named "[[:Category:Tudor dynasty]]".
# When you search for the topic in Google, there are about [https://www.google.com.au/#q=house+of+tudor 8,670,000 results for "House of Tudor"], but only about [https://www.google.com.au/#q=tudor+dynasty 432,000 results for "Tudor dynasty"]. This trait is shared with other royal house search results with about [https://www.google.com.au/search?q=house+of+windsor&gws_rd=cr,ssl&ei=pYhqVcLMJ4HUmAWOnIGwDw 36,000,000 results for "House of Windsor"] but only about [https://www.google.com.au/search?q=windsor+dynasty&gws_rd=cr,ssl&ei=qYhqVZmmNeTAmQXqx4HIDg 592,000 results for "Windsor dynasty"]; also there are about [https://www.google.com.au/search?q=house+of+normandy&gws_rd=cr,ssl&ei=r4hqVdeZFsjFmAWmtoGIAQ 4,730,000 results for "House of Normabdy"], but only about [https://www.google.com.au/search?q=normandy+dynasty&gws_rd=cr,ssl&ei=s4hqVc-sNYfHmwXfnIPQBg 406,000 results for "Normandy dynasty"]. Consequently, many results for "_____ dynasty" are titled "House of _____" anyway.
# [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/608456/House-of-Tudor Encyclopedia Britannica uses "House of Tudor"] as do many history websites.
# There is a distinct difference between the terms ''House'' and ''Dynasty'': a ''House'' is generally synonymous with a family and can exist long before or long after that house's rule begins or ends (House of Tudor ruled from 1066-1135 but existed from 911 C.E.), whereas a ''Dynasty'' is a term generally associated with Asian culture used to describe the ruling period of a family or house (e.g. [[Qing dynasty]] was the ruling period of the [[House of Aisin Gioro]]). Even the Wikipedia article for [[Dynasty]] states that: ''"A dynasty is a ''sequence of rulers'' from the same family"'' and that ''"The dynastic ''family'' or lineage may be known as a 'house'"'' with "the term "dynasty" may be used to delimit the era during which the family reigned".
# Using the name "House of Tudor" also reduces confusion with modern pieces related to the ''ruling period'' of the house such as books and television series named "The Tudors" or "Tudors", as "House of Tudor" related specifically to the royal house itself.
# Renaming the page allows for ancestral history of the house, currently in the small [[Tudors of Penmynydd]] article, to be integrated into the new article. Consequently, many ancestors of the ruling line of Tudors possess the surname "Tudor". This can also be seen in the article [[House of Normandy]] where it was founded for the Dukes of Normandy in 911 C.E. by [[Rollo]], while they came to power as Kings of England in 1066 C.E. under [[William the Conqueror|William I]].
# There was unanimous support for a page move at [[Talk:Tudor dynasty#Move to House of Tudor]]. But for some unknown reason, the move was never carried out.

Consequently, there is a valid argument to move the page to '''House of Tudor'''. [[User:Nick Mitchell 98|Nick Mitchell 98]] ([[User talk:Nick Mitchell 98|talk]]) 04:46, 31 May 2015 (UTC)}}

I do not know what the opinion of the community is, but my personal opinion is that this is not an encyclopedic article. It is written like an essay, from a non-neutral point of view and in emotional language. The ''Deus ex machina'' section, for example, compares the Greek political scene of the 1970s to Ancient Greek drama. This might be excellent for a Political Science thesis, but it is not suitable for an encyclopaedia article.

There has been a discussion that has arisen over what deems an article to warrant having these templates used. Specifically it has come up on articles about wildfires that use {{tl|Current wildfire}} (a sub-template). The question is:

'''To qualify for the template, does the page need to have a certain number of edits in recent days, or does the fact that it is a currently unfolding event mean it is current. In other words, does a wildfire that is still burning and has not been contained (thus information is changing daily) qualify as a "Current wildfire" even if only a couple of edits a day are taking place?'''

The statement up for discussion is: 

'''''Any wildfire that is actively burning and has not been contained, qualifies as an active and current wildfire and thus should have {{tl|current wildfire}} placed upon the page until it is 100% contained.'''''

Volkswagen has admitted that it mislead testers by using software in its TDi diesel engines that turned on NOx emission reduction systems during static dynamometer testing that were normally left inactive. The US EPA Issued a [http://www3.epa.gov/otaq/cert/documents/vw-nov-caa-09-18-15.pdf notice of violation] describing the measures Volkswagen took to mislead testing and compliance with the Clean Air Act. The EPA lists "Alleged Violations" on page 3. However, Volkswagen has not (yet) been called to any US court, and the EPA has not declared that there has been illegal behaviour on the part of Volkswagen.

Some media sources have declared that Volkswagen was guilty of illegal acts, and these sources are being used to state in Wikipedia that Volkswagen committed illegal acts.

Should Wikipedia:
* '''Declare''' in its own voice that Volkswagen acted illegally?
* '''Hedge''' any declarations by using the word "alleged" or "allegedly" or similar, as the EPA has done?
* '''Say nothing''' about 'guilty' or 'illegal' in Wikipedia's voice but report fairly the claims made by various reliable sources in the voice of those sources.
* '''Wait''' for actual court proceedings to occur before passing judgement?

I propose that the dates in the article be changed from the AD system to the CE system.

'''Background, rationale''': {{U|Ogress}} made a couple of edits a while ago which were partly reverted [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tr%C6%B0ng_Sisters&diff=679218624&oldid=678325042 here] by {{u|༆}}, changing "CE" back to "AD". [[WP:ERA]] requires us, unfortunately, to discuss changing the way we date on the talk page, which is what I'm doing here. As it happens, the AD dating was introduced [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tr%C6%B0ng_Sisters&diff=7997393&oldid=2436974 here], by someone who did the article a favor by doubling it in size--but that quick edit should not be a sufficient reason for us to keep an inappropriate system of dating.<p>"AD" is inappropriate geographically and historically since the topic, the area, the historical era, in short everything in it has no relationship whatsoever to Christianity. If we're going to use the Western system of dating (there is a non-Western dating in the article as well, in the quotes), we need to use a system that makes sense, and it makes no sense to date these subjects, these events, by way of a ''Christian'' system of dating.

#'''Support''' The current expectations of !voters are unrealistic. Several years of experience, tens of thousands of edits, accurate participation in all admin areas, the right "hit rate" at AfD. It's nonsense. My idea of the right admin candidate is simple: the candidate has been around for a time (about 9 months to a year), shows no signs of habitually making personal attacks, and has demonstrated knowledge of basic policies. Some oppose for extremely petty reasons not grounded in policy. We were much less strict previous years, and Wikipedia didn't plunge into ruin. --[[User:Biblioworm|<span style="color:#6F4E37;">'''''Biblio'''''</span>]][[User_talk:Biblioworm|<span style="color:#6F4E37">'''''worm'''''</span>]] 00:20, 15 October 2015 (UTC)}}

Should the information about [[piggate]] be moved from the 'Education' section to the 'Personal life' section, under its own subheading 'Accusations of bestiality'?

These are serious allegations, and, if true, reveal some disturbing facts about the sexual predilections of the current [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].

Other editors keep reverting my edit, saying that David Cameron was only posing for a photo (so he was producing porn then?) and that the act doesn't constitute a sexual act, because the pig was dead and wasn't penetrated in the anus or vagina. So, oral sex with a dead body doesn't count? Not when David Cameron is involved?

Yesterday, I swapped out the [[Template:Geobox/type/river|Geobox river]] template on this page for the [[Template:Infobox river|Infobox river]] template. [[User:TimK MSI]] didn't like that and reverted my edit. Today, I undid his reversion. Tim wants to establish consensus about the change. I'm skeptical that anyone else cares except him and me, but consensus is what makes Wikipedia go round so I'm putting it out to the editor community to decide. (Please note:  we are having the same disagreement over the [[Little Arkansas River]] article.)

I think the [[Template:Infobox river|Infobox river]] template is more concise, logically structured, and aesthetically clearer and simpler. The field labels are more straightforward and logically grouped (e.g. elevation data clustered together), and it contains less redundancy (i.e. no redundant field to enter "river" into when that's already included in the name of the stream). It also adds the Progression field which provides a quick and easy-to-understand way of conveying the relationship of a tributary to its parent streams.

[[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Rivers#Infoboxes]] lists both templates and appears to be agnostic as to which one should be used.

Both templates contain fields for mostly the same basic information so, ultimately, I think this boils down to aesthetic preference.

So what do you say, Wikipedia?  Which one should be used:  the Infobox river template, or the Geobox river template?  [[User:FUBAR007|FUBAR007]] ([[User talk:FUBAR007|talk]]) 16:17, 2 October 2015 (UTC)}}

There is disagreement as to how to represent claims of harassment by Hari and d'Entremont. The following questions would seem to summarise the possible positions:
#d'Endremont:
## Should the claim of harassment by d'Entremont cited to the interview in BostInno and backed by the presented examples drawn from her own social media feeds, be included?
## If so, should it be represented ''in Wikipedia's voice'' as d'Entremont having ''been harassed'', or should it be [[WP:ATT|attributed]] to d'Entremont, for example in the form ''d'Entremont is reported to have received "death threats following her takedown of 'Food Babe'"''?
#Hari:
## Should the claim of harassment by Hari cited to the interview in The Atlantic and backed by the presented examples drawn from her own social media feeds, be included?
## If so, should it be represented ''in Wikipedia's voice'' as Hari having ''been harassed'', or should it be [[WP:ATT|attributed]] to Hari, for example in the form ''Hari states that she is "getting attacked every day with a death threat."''?

'''Opinions'''

* My view
::1: First preference 1.1, second preference 1.2. '''as attribution'''. The claim can be shown to exist but the comments seem to me to be trolling not harassment and there does not appear to be any independent analytical commentary re the legitimacy of these claims, they originate solely with d'Entremont in an interview.
::2: First preference 2.1, second preference 2.2. '''as attribution'''. The claim can be shown to exist but the comments seem to me to be trolling not harassment and there does not appear to be any independent analytical commentary re the legitimacy of these claims, they originate solely with Hari in an interview.

Heya. We just need some more eyes and opinions about a move discussion. There were two 13th-century figures known as "Peter of Spain" ({{lang-la|Petrus Hispanus}}) who may or may not have been identical with one another: one was a logician and the other became [[Pope John XXI]]. Since they have often been conflated, some editors would like to treat the logician as the {{sc|primarytopic}} and just place a hatnote dab for the pope. My own view is that, even though the pope's {{sc|commonname}} is [[Pope John XXI]], his notability is great enough that [[Peter of Spain]] should remain a dab between him and the logician. A third option—since absolutely nothing is known of "Peter of Spain the logician" apart from the texts ascribed to him—would be to eliminate "his" article altogether and just treat "him" (to the extent he ever existed) at pages dealing with his works.

There is a debate on how we should include a widely reported statistic relating to the percentage of victims, who when asked why they didn't report the incident, answered they didn't think it was "serious enough" per the study and news reports.

The section leads with a high level statistic for the rates of all types of sexual assault and misconduct, "The 2015 Association of American Universities (AAU) Campus Survey on Sexual Assault, one of the largest studies ever of college sexual violence, drew responses from 150,000 students at 27 schools, including most of the Ivy League. It found that more than 20 percent of female and 5 percent of male undergraduates said that they were victims of sexual assault and misconduct".

The AAU study, [https://www.aau.edu/uploadedFiles/AAU_Publications/AAU_Reports/Sexual_Assault_Campus_Survey/Report%20on%20the%20AAU%20Campus%20Climate%20Survey%20on%20Sexual%20Assault%20and%20Sexual%20Misconduct.pdf Table 6-1, page 110] contains the following:

{| class="wikitable"
! Percentage reporting or not, with reason
! Penetration by Force
! Penetration by Incapacitation
! Sexual Touching by Force
! Sexual Touching by Incapacitation
|-
| ''Contacted at least one program in university list''
| 25.5%
| 13.3%
| 7.0%
| 5.0%
|-
| ''Did not contact any programs'' reason: "I did not think it was serious enough to report"
| 58.6%
| 62.1%
| 74.1%
| 75.6%
|}
Several news reports that covered the high level findings in AAU survey also included the following details from page 110.  I have provided a few samples (with direct quotes provided):

* Washington Post, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/09/23/the-latest-big-sexual-assault-survey-is-like-others-more-hype-than-science/ "the vast majorities of poll respondents who said they had not reported to campus authorities the events that the AAU classified as sexual assaults — 'the dominant reason was it was not considered serious enough,']
* Chicago Tribune, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-college-rape-survey-edit-0924-20150923-story.html "More than half of those who didn't report a rape said they didn't think it was serious enough to report."]

Looking for input on two approaches discussed in this talk page to handle this:

# In the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_sexual_assault#2015_Campus_Climate_Surveys 2015 Campus Climate Survey section], add language with some of the multiple cites including the AAU study along the lines of, "The survey also reported that the majority of students whose responses were classified as sexual assault did not think their experience was "serious enough to report"."
# Only include this finding in the '''2015 Campus Climate Survey''' if it includes criticisms/counterpoints to these kinds of finding about surveys in general, making points like, "First, a salient research issue is what students mean when they define incidents as not serious enough to report. For conservatives, the phrase "not serious" is taken in a strictly literal sense as meaning that the incidents were unimportant. For feminists, however, such a response may merely indicate a false consciousness expressed by women acculturated to see their victimization as somehow acceptable."

# Q: Should FR Yugoslavia's image be included in the lead? 
# Q: Should article title be renamed to List of countries named Yugoslavia
# Q: What does Yugoslavia in the article title stands for?

The article clearly states that FR Yugoslavia is just one of successor states to Yugoslavia that happens to have the same name (the answer to why is given in the text of the article) and the image which puts it next to Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Socialist Yugoslavia implicates that FR Yugoslavia is the sole successor to those two states. That makes the text of the article is contradiction with that image. The text of the article says that Yugoslavia had seized to exist in 1991/1992 and that it broke up to 5 states. As I see it the problem is with the definition to what does "Yugoslavia" from the title stands for? If it stands for 'ONE' county then we can't have FR Yugoslavia's image next to Socialist Yugoslavia and Kingdom of Yugoslavia. If it stands for 'MULTIPLE' countries that have "Yugoslavia" in it's name than the image is ok, but the article body needs to explain that clearly. The present body's context is that it stands for a single country, otherwise the title should be stated List of counties named Yugoslavia which would clearly implicit that there were more countries. Furthermore, the years of FR Yugoslavia's existence is stated as 1992-2003 when in fact that state existed from 1992-2006 under 2 different names. The years of Kingdom of Yugoslaiva's existence is states as 1918-1943, when in fact Kingdom of Serbs,Croats and Slovenes had changed its name to Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. So that makes the image in conflict even with itself. If FR Yugoslavia existed up to 2003 when only the name was changed then Kingdom of Yugoslavia "exists" from 1929.

Should Dinesh D'Souza be removed from the lead, only to be mentioned in the main article?

The man's importance to the term is dubious. The term's had widespread use before he wrote the first Illiberal Education in 1991, which doesn't seem to even use the term. The second one isn't that notable, a mere 32 page speech-to-text. Obviously he should be mentioned in the article, but in the lead? I don't think so. --[[User:Mr. Magoo and McBarker|Mr. Magoo and McBarker]] ([[User talk:Mr. Magoo and McBarker|talk]]) 12:05, 22 October 2015 (UTC)}}

I propose deleting these portions of the article:<BR> 
:''In 2000 she started a Women In Business program at Handbag.com, fielding thousands of business plans submitted by women and arranging start-up loans through Barclays Bank, the program's sponsor.''<BR>
I'm innately concerned with this sentence because it's putting lipstick on a pig. Nancy was tying-in women to high-interest bank loans that they would then sign-over to her for her multi-level marketing scheme. That aside, however, it is sourced to two non-RS, something called "Erisea Magazine" which appears to be a non-RS website (plus it's an interview), and something called inspiringfifty.com, another non-RS website. <BR>
:''In addition to offering a distribution channel for niche products, MyShowcase provides mentoring, training, and flextime employment for over 400 women who wish to develop their own beauty businesses.''<BR>
This sentence is inherently deceptive by phrasing a [[Cutco]]-style door-to-door commission-based selling program as "flextime employment" ... "own your own business!" is the marketing-speak these kind-of outfits use to recruit their "entrepreneurs" who usually make zilch (the company reels in everything from the initial investment these poor women are forced to indebt themselves to pay-out).  
:''She is an active promoter of women in business. ''<BR>
Not sourced to RS.<BR>
:''She was named one of the fifty most inspiring women in European tech by the Inspiring Fifty organisation in 2015.''<BR>

This article was substantially trimmed (by an editor single-handedly, I believe) to remove every entry that didn't seem to have a corresponding Wikipedia article. The editor also added comments and talk-page warnings forbidding the addition of new entries that didn't have a corresponding Wikipedia article. I believe the former list was encyclopedic and not overly long, and that several entries didn't necessarily fail [[WP:Notability|notability]] criteria any more than the current ones even though they lacked an article, and that it should be reinstated.
Should the strict warnings about only including Android distributions with a Wikipedia articles be removed, and (at least the more prominent9 entries be reinstated?

There has been an influx of activity revolving around esports articles and I am admittedly concerned about the quality of these articles. Other than the sources generally being dubious, I've also noticed that their naming conventions have been odd and inconsistent, with some retaining the standard full names that is most common on Wikipedia, while others include a pseudonym in the middle.

The following articles have me worried about their naming conventions: [[Chang "FreedoM" Young-suk]], [[Chun "Sweet" Jung-hee]], [[Jang "Moon" Jae-ho]], [[Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok]], [[Lim "NesTea" Jae-duk]], [[Won "PartinG" Lee-sak]], [[AmazHS]], [[Ryan "Saiyan" Danford (Halo player)]], [[Reginald (Team SoloMid)]], [[Dyrus]], [[Greg "Idra" Fields]], [[GH057ayame]], [[Ben "Karma" Jackson]], [[Victor "Lil Poison" De Leon III]], [[Fear (Dota 2 player)]], [[Chris "HuK" Loranger]], [[Carlos "Cpt Anarchy" Morales]], [[Nadeshot]], [[NYChrisG]], [[PangaeaPanga]], [[Dan "OGRE 1" Ryan]], [[Tom "OGRE 2" Ryan]], [[Trump (Hearthstone streamer)]], [[Trihex]], [[Tom "Tsquared" Taylor]], [[Nate "Ataraxia" Mark]], [[Kripparrian]], [[Bananasaurus Rex]], [[Luo "Ferrari 430" Feichi]], [[Wang "Banana" Jiao]], [[Wang "infi" Xuwen]], [[Xu "BurNIng" Zhilei]], [[Sander "Vo0" Kaasjager]], [[Grubby]], [[Kayane]], [[Av3k]], [[xPeke]], [[GeT RiGhT]], [[Leffen]], [[Fredrik "MaDFroG" Johansson]] and [[F0rest]] - (that last one I created as "Patrik Lindberg").

What we need to do is reach a conclusion about how to name these articles. [[User:DarthBotto|D<small>ARTH</small>B<small>OTTO</small>]]<sub>&nbsp;[[User talk:DarthBotto|talk]]•[[Special:Contributions/DarthBotto|cont]]</sub> 09:58, 9 November 2015 (UTC)}}

The [[Blue Army (Poland)]] article in its current form disproportionately emphasizes subject matter related to the Jewish experience with Gen. Haller's army ("BA"). This creates an '''undue weight''' dilemma, where a secondary issue gradually takes over the article. The basic fact remains that during the 2 year conflict in [[Western Ukraine]] between the Poles and Ukrainians, Jewish casualties were "minimal" as noted by historians [[Tadeusz Piotrowski]] and [[Norman Davies]]. <ref>Tadeusz Piotrowski. (1998). Poland's Holocaust: Ethnic Strife, Collaboration with Occupying Forces and Genocide in the Second Republic, 1918-1947, McFarland: page 43.</ref> Estimates range between 5 and 400-500 Jewish casualties, which were the direct result of actions committed by BA soldiers — a force of 68,500 men. Also, as noted by Encyclopedia Judaica such actions were the result of "individual soldiers",<ref>http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08257.html</ref> so the article text should not overemphasize controversial subject matter to tacitly imply that the entire army was a pogroming force.

The article contains the following '''neutrality''' issues as described in [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]]:
*depth of detail; 
*quantity of text; and 
*prominence of placement.

The text related to the ''"Anti-Jewish violence"'' section has over the years grown disproportionally in relation to the rest of the article. Also, because of a lack of English language sources on the subject matter, the article is nearly void of any mention of Ukrainian casualties, yet the Ukrainians were the main opponent of the BA — not the local Jewish contingent. I recommend the following action with the help of fellow editors: '''To remove the third paragraph of the ''"Introduction"'' section and re-edit the ''"Anti-Jewish violence"''  section down from 4 to 2 full paragraphs, in order to restore proportionality within the article.'''

Options include the following:
*'''Option 1:''' ''Re-edit the sections as recommended''
*'''Option 2:''' ''Keep as is no changes''
*'''Option 3:''' ''Other possible solutions''

Consensus has been reached that [[Amy Tran]] and [[Amy Swensen]] should be merged.  The problem is that it's not clear whether to merge into Amy Tran, her maiden name, Amy Swensen, her married name, or Amy Tran Swensen, which is also used in a lot of articles.  She's been named as Amy Swensen and Amy Tran Swensen in articles so it's not clear what the best option is.

This discusses a clarification to MOS:IDENTITY as recommended in [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)/Archive_121#MOS:IDENTITY_clarification|this recent proposal]].  Which names and pronouns should be used for transgender individuals in articles of which they are ''not'' the principal subjects and that discuss events that took place before they publicly announced their transition?  In the following examples, the first article is about the men's Olympics and the second article is about a film.

*PREVIOUS ONLY: {{green| Generally it is unnecessary to go in detail over changes in name or gender presentation unless these are relevant to the passage in which the person is mentioned. Refer to transgender individuals using the name and pronouns that they were using at the time of the event in question.}}
*::Example: Bruce Jenner competed in the men's Olympics in 1976; he won a gold medal.  Larry Wachowski wrote the script for his film in 1994.
*CURRENT ONLY: {{green|Generally it is unnecessary to go in detail over changes in name or gender presentation unless these are relevant to the passage in which the person is mentioned.  Refer to transgender individuals using the name and pronouns that correspond with their most recent publicly announced self-identification.}}
*::Example: Caitlyn Jenner competed in the men's Olympics in 1976; she won a gold medal.  Lana Wachowski wrote the script for her film in 1994.
*ALWAYS BOTH: {{green|Generally it is unnecessary to go in detail over changes in name or gender presentation unless these are relevant to the passage in which the person is mentioned. Refer to transgender individuals by both names, concisely; use either name first, as needed.}}
*::Example: Bruce Jenner (later Caitlyn Jenner) competed in the men's Olympics in 1976; he won a gold medal.  Lana Wachowski (credited as Larry Wachowski) wrote the script for her film in 1994.  (Use the pronouns which correspond to the name which is used first.)
*BOTH IF RELEVANT: {{green|Generally it is unnecessary to go in detail over changes in name or gender presentation unless these are relevant to the passage in which the person is mentioned.  Refer to a transgender individual by both names, concisely, if the previous name is relevant in the context of the article where the reference is made; otherwise, use only the current name.}}
*:: Example: Bruce Jenner (later Caitlyn Jenner) competed in the men's Olympics in 1976; he won a gold medal. (Readers may wonder why a woman participated in a men-only event, and including Jenner's previous name resolves this.)  Lana Wachowski wrote the script for her film in 1994. (Readers will not wonder why a woman wrote a script.) (Use the pronouns which correspond to the name which is used first.)
*ONLY THE MORE RELEVANT: {{green|Generally it is unnecessary to go in detail over changes in name or gender presentation unless these are relevant to the passage in which the person is mentioned. Use the name and gender identity most relevant to the context of the passage in which the reference is made. When it is unclear which one is more suitable, default to the identity that would be used in the main biography.}}
*:: Example: Bruce Jenner competed in the men's Olympics in 1976; he won a gold medal. Lana Wachowski wrote the script for her film in 1994.
*OTHER (1) = DEPENDS ON CONTEXT: {{green|Use the name and gender identity that fits best in the context of the article where the reference is made ([[WP:SURPRISE|principle of least surprise]] for the reader). When it is unclear which one suits better, default to the identity as defined for the main biography. Generally it is unnecessary to go in detail over name and/or gender identity changes, unless these are relevant to the article where the name of the person is inserted.}}
*:: Examples: see [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Archive_173#Ninth_draft_.28proposal_2.29_.28revisiting_MOS:IDENTITY.29|Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#Ninth draft (proposal 2)]]
*OTHER (2) = PREVIOUS STRICTLY APPLIED, BOTH WHERE USEFUL: {{green|For historical events, refer to transgender individuals using the name and pronouns that they were using at the time of the event in question.  However, when the scope of a word, even within a sentence, is not clearly limited to the past, use the present name and pronouns.  Consistency is not particularly important.  Both may be used at editors' discretion if it makes the article better to do so.}}
*:: Example: Bruce Jenner competed in the men's Olympics in 1976; he won a gold medal.  His world record was broken in 1980, but her innovation of carrying a spectator's American flag on a victory lap continues to this day.  Larry Wachowski wrote the script for her film in 1994. (The innovation is still her innovation; the film is still her film, hence it is ''her'' film, ''her'' innovation.  Had her world record survived until 2015, then it would be ''her'' world record!)
*OTHER (3): (please explain)

'''Introduction'''

'''Purpose'''

'''The intent of this RfC is to broadly identify the problem(s) with our administrator election process.''' As was mentioned just now, we are focusing on broad issues here. Assuming that any of these issues obtain consensus (as described in the "Instructions for closers" section), there will likely be a second RfC that will follow this one, so that we can narrow our range of focus and expand on the issues discussed here.
 

'''Instructions for voters'''

There are eight proposals to start with, but additional proposals may be added. ('''Note''': Please do not add duplicate proposals.) Editors are to support, oppose, or simply comment on (in the "Comments" section) the proposals accordingly. To represent the highest level of consensus possible, participants are encouraged to vote on as many proposals as they are able.

'''Instructions for closers'''

The completely uninvolved closer(s) shall have the discretion to determine which proposals attained consensus. They should, however, be lenient when determining which proposals should advance to formal consideration, since it would be beneficial to discuss as many potential issues as possible (except those which clearly did not attain consensus).

'''Voting'''

'''A: High standards'''

Participants at RfA generally expect too much of candidates (e.g., have excessively strict criteria). Those who !vote at RfA should lower their expectations and understand that the majority of candidates will be less than perfect. 

'''Support A'''

#'''Support''' The current expectations of !voters are unrealistic. Several years of experience, tens of thousands of edits, accurate participation in all admin areas, the right "hit rate" at AfD. It's nonsense. My idea of the right admin candidate is simple: the candidate has been around for a time (about 9 months to a year), shows no signs of habitually making personal attacks, and has demonstrated knowledge of basic policies. Some oppose for extremely petty reasons not grounded in policy. We were much less strict previous years, and Wikipedia didn't plunge into ruin. --[[User:Biblioworm|<span style="color:#6F4E37;">'''''Biblio'''''</span>]][[User_talk:Biblioworm|<span style="color:#6F4E37">'''''worm'''''</span>]] 00:20, 15 October 2015 (UTC)}}

"The relationship was parodied in Clare Booth Luce's ''The Women'' as the characters Buck Winston and the Countess de Lage." is not sourced, and does not belong on any Wikipedia article without strong sourcing.

"Within the studios, Cooper's bisexuality as a young man was well known" is sourced to  "The Fixers".   It is seemingly based on a single anecdote about his wife sniffing his pants.  

"In 1929 Cooper met the aspiring Paramount actor Anderson Lawler, with whom he had a three year affair, and also lived with for a time. " is sourced to  Swindell's biography of Cooper.   Not checkable online, alas.   The real source appears to be [https://books.google.com/books?id=Kmst4STpu2UC&pg=PT83&dq=Cooper+met+the+aspiring+Paramount+actor+Anderson+Lawler,+with+whom+he+had+a+three+year+affair&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIsqa9oO7JyAIVwhc-Ch0buwqC#v=onepage&q=Cooper%20met%20the%20aspiring%20Paramount%20actor%20Anderson%20Lawler%2C%20with%20whom%20he%20had%20a%20three%20year%20affair&f=false]   for which the claim appears to be a fairly simple rewording. "Cooper also had a three year affair with a man, the young Alabama born Anderson Lawler, an aspiring film actor."  The Mann ref is also not readily checkable online.   The Laurence book is likely problematic - it is not published by a major reputable publisher (basically "Lyle Stuart"). 

"Lawler introduced Cooper to Hollywood society, but the relationship (also confirmed by Cooper's later wife [[Patricia Neal]], caused intense jealousy with Bow and Velez"  is sourced to the Shearer book (the likely source for the earlier claim).  Unfortunately, the claim is not backed explicitly by the work cited.

What would be left is:

:''In 1929 Cooper met an actor named Anderson Lawler, whom he lived with for a time.''

sourced to the Shearer book - and sticking to ascertainable and sourced fact.  [[User:Collect|Collect]] ([[User talk:Collect|talk]]) 16:03, 17 October 2015 (UTC)}}

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
Versions of a right to unbundle blocking (and/or other admin-level anti-vandal tools, such as protection) have often been proposed in the past. The proposers claim that an unbundling of the block tool will reduce AIV backlogs and empower prolific counter-vandals to stop vandals in their tracks quicker. On the other hand, the opposition has various reasons to oppose such a proposal, most of them claiming that this would add unnecessary bureaucracy and that AIV backlogs are rare.

Indeed, opinion on a admin-level right for counter-vandals has been split. The latest major [[WP:POLL|RfC]] on this took place on January 2015 at [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 120#Proposed user right: Vandal fighter]]. There were 49 supporters, but the 61 opposers were the majority.

Nonetheless, this proposal does still have support; thus, some sort of trial should be executed to tip the split consensus. Trials that have led to consensus in the past exist; for example, the [[WP:PC|pending changes]] trial.

To decrease the risk from this trial, the limited blocking right for the trial should be given to to ''prolific'' counter-vandals. If the trial succeeds and consensus is gained for the full application for such a right, then it could be extended to more counter-vandals, and a name will be given to the right ("vandal fighter" sounds suboptimal at best).

<hr>

I therefore propose a '''eight-week trial''' for '''the ability to block IPs and users with no user rights (even including autoconfirmed) for no more than 48 hours''' {{color|green|'''for obvious vandalism after sufficient warning'''}}; admins or any other counter-vandals with this right can revert such blocks, provided that no [[WP:WW|wheel warring]] occurs. This trial right will be given to counter-vandals that have countered vandals long-term; the proposed standard is at least '''18 months tenure and at least 1,000 vandal reversions.''' Administrators willing to grant this right should check possible candidates for the trial then contact them to request that they participate in the trial. If any participant is causing damage, then the right can be removed unilaterally by any admin. This granting process is only for the trial.

After the trial ends, the participants in the trial should give feedback on the user right then a final RfC will be started, gauging approval of the right and the consensus on the criteria, granting, and abilities of the right.

This vote '''should not''' ''solely'' focus on the suitability of the right, but should substantially focus on if this right should at least be ''tried''.

It is '''not''' what ''our readers'' are looking for when they want "economic history". They're looking for something closer to [[economic history of the world]]. (E.g., I was directed here by a misplaced link heading [[Trade#History]] which was obviously attempting to point at coverage of the topic, not the modern academic field studying the topic.) Which one wins in a fight like that? or is this a conditional thing where we ignore [[economic history of the world]] until it's in better shape?&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User talk:LlywelynII|<span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em; class=texhtml">Llywelyn<font color="Gold">II</font></span>]] 04:57, 22 October 2015 (UTC)}}

This RfC concerns [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domestic_violence&diff=686949575&oldid=686938263 this] ''Scientific American'' text; the source is [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-men-the-more-belligerent-sex/ here]. See the section (which this section is a part of) above for further detail. For those viewing this from the WP:RfC page, click on [[Talk:Domestic violence#Domestic violence affects both genders and children]] for such detail. '''One argument''' is that "the conclusion that domestic violence disproportionately affects women is widely supported, far more supported than any notion that domestic violence disproportionately affects men, means that the statement that 'rates of domestic violence are roughly equal between men and women' is the minority viewpoint/aspect. [...] The rates of domestic violence are roughly equal between men and women statement is problematic because of the way it [i]s presented and because of the sourcing; the text [i]s presented in the article as though it is some review that found that matter to be the case, when it is actually an article commenting on Straus's analyses." Domestic violence disproportionately affecting women is not simply about the physical evidence, and female domestic violence victims undderreporting their victimization is very prevalent. If the ''Scientific American'' content is to stay, its format should be changed, per the [[WP:Due weight]] policy; we should not be giving [[WP:Valid|false balance]] to these matters. Ideally, we should also be using better sources for health content, per [[WP:MEDRS]]. The '''other argument''' is that "many studies indicate that women are guilty of more aggression and other forms of DV like verbal/psychological/emotional violence. Domestic violence is not just the physical! The article needs to be balanced. Removing other significant reliable sources which provide a different perspective is not the answer [...] Domestic violence affects all of these groups, not equally perhaps but the article needs to reflect what the reliable sources say. [...] most secondary sources indicate that women are more affected by physical violence. But then again all of the secondary sources also state that there is a huge level of [[under-reporting]] of domestic violence to police and authorities by men. [..] So, common sense would tell us that if this was the case and men are very resistant to report domestic violence for a plethora of reasons, perhaps current statistics are an inaccurate reflection of how DV affects one group more so than another? Or how different forms of domestic violence affects. Also statistics vary widely between different countries and can change significantly." 

Below are good-quality or high-quality sources reporting that domestic violence disproportionately affects women; some of them include commentary on men as victims of domestic violence. Also see the [[#Discussion]] section below, for sources that focus on women as perpetrators of domestic violence.
{{collapse top|title=Click on this to see the sources.}}

1. [http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10896-009-9298-4 This] 2009 ''Domestic Violence Against Women: Systematic Review of Prevalence Studies'' source states that it was important to use consistent definitions of domestic violence, and that: Results of this review emphasize that '''violence against women has reached epidemic proportions in many societies.''' Accurate measurement of the prevalence of domestic violence remains problematic and further culturally sensitive research is required to develop more effective preventive policies and programs. 

2. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ltJxlsoMV4wC&pg=PR13 This] 2011 ''International Human Rights Law and Domestic Violence: The Effectiveness of International Human Rights Law'' source, from [[Taylor & Francis]], page PR13, states, "'''This is an issue that affects vast numbers of women throughout all nations of the world. [...] Although there are cases in which men are the victims of domestic violence, nevertheless 'the available research suggests that domestic violence is overwhelmingly directed by men against women [...] In addition, violence used by men against female partners tends to be much more severe than that used by women against men. Mullender and Morley state that 'Domestic violence against women is the most common form of family violence worldwide.'"'''

3. [http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1170891 This] 2012 ''Screening Women for Intimate Partner Violence: A Systematic Review to Update the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation'' source states, "'''Although IPV affects both men and women as victims and perpetrators (4), more women experience IPV and most studies about screening and interventions for IPV enroll women.''' Approximately 1.3 to 5.3 million women in the United States experience IPV each year (5–6). Lifetime estimates range from 22% to 39% (7–8). The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey indicated that 30% of women experience physical violence, 9% rape, 17% sexual violence other than rape, and 48% psychological aggression from their intimate partners over their lifetimes (4). Costs related to IPV are estimated to be between $2 and $7 billion each year (9)."

4. [http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/77432/1/WHO_RHR_12.36_eng.pdf This] 2012 ''Understanding and addressing 
violence against women'' [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) source states, "'''The overwhelming global burden of IPV is borne by women. Although women can be violent in relationships with men, often in self-defence, and violence sometimes occurs in same-sex partnerships, the most common perpetrators of violence against women are male intimate partners or ex-partners (1). By contrast, men are far more likely to experience violent acts by strangers or acquaintances than by someone close to them (2).''' How common is intimate partner violence? A growing number of population-based surveys have measured the prevalence of IPV, most notably the WHO multi-country study on women’s health and domestic violence against women, which collected data on IPV from more than 24000 women in 10 countries, 1 representing diverse cultural, geographical and urban/rural settings (3) The study confirmed that IPV is widespread in all countries studied (Figure 1). In addition, a comparative analysis of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from nine countries found that the percentage of ever-partnered women who reported ever experiencing any physical or sexual violence by their current or most recent husband or cohabiting partner ranged from 18% in Cambodia to 48% in Zambia for physical violence, and 4% to 17% for sexual violence (4). In a 10-country analysis of DHS data, physical or sexual IPV ever reported by currently married women ranged from 17% in the Dominican Republic to 75% in Bangladesh (5). Similar ranges have been reported from other multi-country studies (6)."

5. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kJXM_eptt0MC&pg=PT780 This] 2013 ''Health and Human Rights in a Changing World'' source, from [[Routledge]], pages 780–781, states, "'''Intimate male partners are most often the main perpetrators of violence against women, a form of violence known as intimate partner violence, 'domestic' violence or 'spousal (or wife) abuse.' Intimate partner violence and sexual violence, whether by partners, acquaintances or strangers, are common worldwide and disproportionately affect women, although are not exclusive to them.'''"

6. [http://books.google.com/books?id=PtpMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA190 This] 2013 ''Regional Protection of Human Rights: Documentary Supplement'' book source, from OUP USA, page 190, states that one of the goals is to recognize "that '''domestic violence disproportionately affects women.'''" Like the book's Google description states, "[I]t illustrates how international human rights law is interpreted and implemented across international organizations and offers examples of political, economic, social problems and legal issues to emphasize the significant impact of international human rights law institutions on the constitutions, law, policies, and societies of different regions." 

7. [http://books.google.com/books?id=AW-jAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA644 This] 2013 ''Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence and Abuse'' source, from [[ABC-CLIO]], page 644, relays, "As the Commission has established in the past, in the discharge of their duties, States must take into account that '''domestic violence is a problem that disproportionately affects women''', since they constitute the majority of the victims." 

8. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/springer/pa/2013/00000004/00000001/art00004 This] 2013 ''Partner Abuse Worldwide'' review, which acknowledges that its definition of domestic violence is not the mainstream view, defining partner abuse broadly to include emotional abuse, any kind of hitting, and who hits first, examined studies from five continents and the correlation between a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence; the authors stated that '''if one looks at who is physically harmed and how seriously, who expresses more fear, who has psychological problems following abuse, domestic violence is significantly gendered and women suffer the most; however, going by their broader paradigm, "partner abuse can no longer be conceived as merely a gender problem, but also (and perhaps primarily) as a human and relational problem, and should be framed as such by everyone concerned."'''

9. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jD51AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA961 This] 2014 ''Cultural Sociology of Mental Illness'' source, from [[SAGE Publications]], page 961, states, "'''Interpersonal violence disproportionately affects women''' and includes child sexual abuse, rape, and domestic violence. Women who have been victims of any kind of violence at any age are at greater risk of developing a mental disorder.'''"

10. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25581055 This] 2015 ''Intimate partner abuse: identifying, caring for and helping women in healthcare settings.'' review (full link to the article [http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/whe.14.59 here]), states, "IPA is a major public health issue, with serious social, economic and health consequences. It has been found to pose at least as high a health risk to women of child bearing age as raised blood pressure, tobacco use and obesity, and is a leading contributor to death, disability and illness for women in this age group [...] Research has found that only 12–20% of women report being asked by their doctor about IPA, with barriers to inquiry including clinician uncertainty about how to ask, lack of knowledge and training about IPA, and insufficient time [17–19]. Barriers to disclosure by women include both internal factors (shame, normalization and minimization) and external factors (perception that others cannot help, judgmental attitudes, previous negative responses from health professionals). Additionally, women are not always at a point where they feel comfortable to disclose. [...] '''Although it is acknowledged that men may also experience IPA, the power disparities present in most cases of IPA mean that women are more often survivors than perpetrators, and that the community health and economic burdens of IPA lie primarily with women as a group.'''"

Starting an RFC to address the issue of using images within the article &mdash; specifically, the three stacked images in the "Competition history" section. The image in question is the second one, "File: Alonso Spain 2015.jpg" as users disagree on its usage. There are two schools of thought:
:# That the three images are being used to show the visual changes to the car over the course of the season, and that as the livery change represents a visual change, it should be included.
:# That the three images are being used to show the performance-related changes to the car (specifically the shape of the nose), and that because a livery change does not bring any change in performance, it should not be included.
The purpose of this RFC is to decide what role the images should play. [[User:Prisonermonkeys|Prisonermonkeys]] ([[User talk:Prisonermonkeys|talk]]) 00:09, 24 October 2015 (UTC)}}

We editors have used many biographical photos of non-notable people whose deaths, suicides, and/or crimes are article topics, like [[suicide of Tyler Clementi]] and [[death of Freddie Gray]]. Those photos of involved non-notable persons have been used in case that photos depicting gruesome events, like a screenshot depicting a suicide or a screenshot of police incident, may be nonexistent. On the other hand, we have photos depicting events used as lead images, such as [[:File:Shooting of Walter Scott.jpeg|a screenshot]] of the [[Shooting of Walter Scott|shooting of unarmed man]], [[:File:AmandaToddVideo.jpg|a screenshot]] of [[suicide of Amanda Todd|a suicidal girl's]] self-made video, and [[:File:Alan Kurdi lifeless body.jpg|the photo]] of [[Death of Alan Kurdi|a little boy]] found at a beach.

A handful of editors have raised the question as to whether non-administrators who are elected to the arbitration committee should be granted the [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrator]] right. ([[Special:PermanentLink/690669905#ArbCom-only admins|1]], [[Special:PermanentLink/690796561#Admin bit for non-admin arbitrators|2]]) Successful candidates are granted the [[Wikipedia:CheckUser|checkuser]] and [[WP:Oversight|oversight]] permissions in order to assist with their duties as an arbitrator. It is outside the scope of the arbitration election commission role to decide if a non-administrator appointed to the arbitration committee should be granted the administrator right and the community does not have an established policy. Given the significant number of non-administrator candidates this year, the community should discuss if non-administrators should or should not be granted administrative rights if appointed. Also, if granted the administrator right, whether or not they may retain it after leaving the arbitration committee.

For ease of reference, the permissions of the administrator, checkuser, and oversight groups are included below:

''' Support granting administrator right '''

#Yes, in order to make them as able as other Arbs to carry out their duties. However, it should be made explicit that the admin right is to be used ''only'' in carrying out ArbCom activities, and not otherwise. --[[User:Tryptofish|Tryptofish]] ([[User talk:Tryptofish|talk]]) 21:50, 15 November 2015 (UTC)}}

[[:File:Christopher Sean Harper-Mercer Myspace photo.jpg]]<br/>
Adding a [http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2015/10/new_details_emerge_on_umpqua_c.html photo of Harper-Mercer] to the article was bound to set off two arguments, a) is it [[WP:NFCC|fair use]] and b) is it glorifying the killer by giving him the publicity that he wanted? The Myspace image has been widely used in media coverage, and even if he is dead, he would still own the copyright on the image if he took it himself.[https://www.legallanguage.com/resources/copyright/copyright-protection-endurance/] The fair use argument is open to debate as people have different views on how strictly this should be interpreted. On the issue of glorifying the killer, I think this is subjective. Most people are agreed that Harper-Mercer wanted to add his name to the history books by doing something disgraceful, but Wikipedia is not censored. Other thoughts welcome. <small>--'''Relisted.'''

I'd like to see some resolution here, so I'm inviting outside parties. (I'd rather not have to create Ken Rosenberg as an AfD test case.) The question is '''whether the ''Grand Theft Auto'' character Ken Rosenberg should have his own article or redirect to another article'''. To summarize the above, this is a proxy case for the line when listicle coverage becomes significant coverage. The four main sources (already [[WP:VG/RS|vetted as reliable]]) are as follows:

Backstory:  I thought it would be better to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Electronic_cigarette&diff=next&oldid=691526739 shorten the text]. The misplaced text was eventually removed from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_cigarette&type=revision&diff=691620538&oldid=691617911 harm reduction] section and I added [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_cigarette&diff=next&oldid=691620538 some information] to the safety section. SM stated my edit to the safety section was a "[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_cigarette&curid=11996885&diff=691625707&oldid=691621741 Rv pre-emptive Quackeditry]". See [[Talk:Electronic_cigarette#Safety_claim_in_Harm_reduction.]] for the previous discussion.

Proposal: I propose including [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_cigarette&diff=prev&oldid=691621741 this text] in [[Electronic cigarette#Safety]] <u>but with better clarification</u>. I think the reader will benefit from knowing reduced volts are generally safer than high volts and according to a report users are not exposed to dangerous levels of aldehydes.

{{rfcquote|text=
When a certification is based on traditional paid-for sales and a factor for streaming, there are often disputes over whether sources which quote the combined sales or the traditional sales should take precedence. Sometimes, as in [[Hello (Adele song)#Certifications]] (UK entry), one source may give both (259,000 paid for, 333,000 combined). Sometimes a more recent combined figure may be available but some editors revert to the last traditional figure. There are strong feelings about inclusion of streaming in music charts and awards but can we try to steer this conversation away from whether we approve or not in order to reach the best solution for the people actually reading the pages?

Background: Music certifications in different countries are measured using different factors and these are changed from time to time due to changes in technology. The two most significant changes were inclusion of digital downloaded songs and inclusion of streaming of songs, which have happened in some countries and not others and at different times. In general, the industry is trying to avoid the drop in headline sales which happened in the 2000s when it was slow to adopt digital downloads as sales of physical records (mainly CDs) fell off; currently, in many places, digital downloads themselves are falling while streaming is growing, so the industry is keen to incorporate streaming into charts and awards to avoid appearing in decline.

The big change is that streaming is not necessarily paid for by the end-user and so it seems wrong to some people that this is labelled a 'sale'. However, from the record company's point of view, there is still a sale to the streaming provider who then may use subscription or advertising to cover it. In some ways this is more reflective of what is being consumed than the old system where shipments were counted, as this was based on preconceptions of what might sell rather than actual demand.

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
Recently, '''clerking''' has been suggested as a solution to the hostile environment at [[WP:RfA|requests for adminship]] (RfA). But before covering clerking, some background:

It is generally accepted<ref>The most recent discussion re-affirming this is [[Wikipedia:2015 administrator election reform/Phase I/RfC#C: Hostile environment]] - over two-thirds of the participants agreed that the environment at RfA "is hostile toward candidates and is discouraging for those who are contemplating a candidacy."</ref> that RfA candidates and participants are being subjected to a less-than-friendly environment by a minority of editors. RfA candidacies have come to an all-time low in 2015; as of December 2015, '''10 fewer candidates run for RfA''' than last year, which was already described as a year of major drought for RfA – we would need a candidacy every three days in the month of December in order to meet 2014's numbers.

Editors, even ones who would likely be good admins, do not wish to run for RfA because of the demeaning and even insulting statements made against candidates and other participants. Even the most prolific and trusted editors are having difficulty nominating candidates.

<hr />
Clerking is commonly offered as one possible solution, although only [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Clerks|one proposal RfC]] has been opened; it failed to gain community support. However, consensus has changed regarding clerking; currently, there is actually a [[Wikipedia:2015 administrator election reform/Phase I/RfC#M: Active clerking at RFA|light to moderate consensus towards clerking]].<ref>About 60 percent of the participants favored clerking at RfA.</ref>

The idea of clerking is to designate a group of ''uninvolved'' editors to maintain decorum and order in RfAs. Clerks are responsible for ensuring that comments, votes, and questions on RfA are civil and germane, and they have the ability to remove and hide votes, comments, and questions in some circumstances. Clerk actions can be challenged and clerks are subject to [[WP:ADMINACCT|admin accountability]], and even a small consensus can overturn a clerk action.

On the main page is a very ''rough'' clerking policy/guideline. It documents the role and responsibilities of editors acting as clerks, ''who'' may clerk RfAs and the level of uninvolvement required, and the process for challenging clerk actions. Of course, the extent and process of clerking can change if there is consensus, and participants in this RfC will be able to vote for several possible options regarding the details of clerking.

Clerking would likely bring the following benefits:
* By maintaining decorum and civility in RfAs, participants and candidates would not be subject to incivil and insulting comments. Editors obsessed with disrupting RfAs would yield less returns from their disruption.
* The candidate would be less stressed by the RfA, as unnecessary questioning and inquisition would be curbed.<ref>See [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Montanabw]]; while there were valid concerns brought up in the RfA, the candidate was essentially interrogated.</ref>
* RfA pages would likely be easier to read, as clerks maintain RfA pages for cleanliness, move long and boring threads to the talk page, and can close discussion that could go off-topic.

<hr />
Continuing on from the [[Wikipedia:2015 administrator election reform/Phase I/RfC#M: Active clerking at RFA|most recent RfC discussing clerking]], I propose for a group of editors (decided by discussion below) to perform some or all the clerking tasks as described on the [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Clerking proposal 2015|'''main page''']] of this RfC on individual RfAs. There will be choices regarding the details of clerking; if you do not support the clerking proposal in ''whole'' on the main page; you may oppose various parts of the clerking proposal.

== GameRankings discussion '''

I think we need to talk about the use of [[GameRankings]]. With current talks about use of Aggregation websites here this one seems to be the most expendable. At least, in my opinion. [[OpenCritic]] has been the new up-and-coming site that might become more popular than industry standard [[Metacritic]]. That's speculation right now as we don't know what's going to happen in the future. Metacritic is also one of two aggregation websites we consider reliable and use at this time. The other being GameRankings. Why do we still use GameRankings? It's older than Metacritic, as well as both sites being owned by [[CBS Interactive]], but you don't hear critics or publishers talk about its importance. So I'm wondering if there should be a cutoff of using GameRankings on Wikipedia. Just stop using it past a certain date. Any other suggestions are welcome of course.

I'm curious as to whether or not this channel is notable enough for an entry. It airs in several countries, yet there's very little actual coverage for this channel apart from its launch. Is that enough to assert notability for a channel? I don't want to nominate this for AfD if it would pass notability guidelines. I've posted at [[WP:TELEVISION]] but received no response.

{{rfcquote|text=
On the 4 November 2015, two administrator accounts [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Bureaucrats%27_noticeboard&oldid=688996858#Compromised_accounts were compromised]. It appears that both account had used passwords on Wikipedia and on other sites and one of the other sites had been breached. The highlighted security issue, however, makes this a good time to review our password requirements. 

This RfC is to look at what levels of password protection we should require and for what usergroups. I intend to start a similar RfC on meta for global changes to the password policy in the near future. I've also asked the question about [[two-factor authentication]]. 

'''Current position'''

*Passwords for all usergroups have the same requirements, but different requirements can be set differently per usergroup and per project. If a password requirement is set for a specific usergroup on a specific project, it will only be enforced if they log in on that project. 
*Adding rules to passwords is very simple, and only requires community consensus to implement. We have a member of the WMF Security Team lined up who is willing to implement some changes for us, assuming we have that consensus. 
*The only current requirement for a password is that it has a non-zero length and is not the same as the user's username.

=Suggestions=

'''Status quo'''

We have the option to make no changes to the password system. If you do not agree with making any changes, please support here. 

;Support ''Status Quo''
# Yes -- the "status quo" requires persons to be cognizant of the problem - making arbitrary changes to requiring (say) 255 characters simply makes the apparent onus fall on the rule-makers, and not the fault of people who have not learned what folks on ISPs learned as a rule more than twenty years ago - do not use easy passwords on important stuff, and feel free to use easy passwords on totally unimportant stuff. Until we get folks who understand this, any changes are going to be a tad futile. [[User:Collect|Collect]] ([[User talk:Collect|talk]]) 19:51, 6 November 2015 (UTC)}}

Current language on notability of athletes includes:
 
:''Athletes from any sport are presumed notable if they have competed at the modern Olympic Games, including the Summer Olympics (since 1896) or the Winter Olympics (since 1924), or have won a medal at the Paralympic Games; e.g. [[Ian Thorpe]] or [[Laurentia Tan]].''

Should this be changed to:

:''Individuals  who have competed at any modern Olympic Games and who have either won a medal or won at least one heat or match in their event shall generally be considered notable. Any individual winning a medal at a Paralympics may also be  generally considered to be notable.''

The material is sourced to Michael Mishak's article In the ''National Journal;'': ''[http://www.nationaljournal.com/s/24397/what-kind-leader-is-marco-rubio-investigation What Kind of Leader Is Marco Rubio? An Investigation]''

# {{talkquote|That position had typically required a lot of arm-twisting, but Rubio took a different approach that relied more on persuading legislators and less on coercing them.}}.
# {{talkquote|Rubio also gained an extra advantage in that regard, because he was sworn in early due to the special election, and he would take advantage of these opportunities to join the GOP leadership.}} .
#{{talkquote|Yet, Rubio's style was very different from Bush's. Where Bush was a very assertive manager of affairs in Tallahassee, Rubio's style was to delegate certain powers, relinquish others, and invite former political rivals into his inner circle.}}.

Should this material be left in the article '''without''' attribution in Wikipedia's voice?

''' Comments '''

* '''Yes'''.  This RFC is '''''malformed''''' for two reasons.  First, the person who started this RFC omitted <s>the very extensive notes at the end of each sentence that provide full attribution and support, and also omitted even</s> footnote numbers that point to <s>that</s> attribution.  Second, the RFC question wrongly says that there is presently no attribution, whereas there is plenty of attribution, just not inline.  I objected to omission of the notes previously at this talk page, so it seems very deliberate now.  The material in question is uncontradicted fact from a reliable news source, not opinion at all.[[User:Anythingyouwant|Anythingyouwant]] ([[User talk:Anythingyouwant|talk]]) 17:06, 7 November 2015 (UTC)}}

Now that Abbott is no longer the Prime Minister, perhaps other images at [[/Archive 3#Infobox image]] can be used, but consensus wouldn't agree to that. Therefore, I'm proposing the September 2014 image, which is a cropped image of his picture with Modi, the Indian PM.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domestic_violence&diff=692874051&oldid=692872745 This], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domestic_violence&diff=692875382&oldid=692874051 this], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domestic_violence&diff=692876358&oldid=692875976 this] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domestic_violence&diff=692878928&oldid=692876524 this] edit show the heart of the concerns. For those viewing this from the WP:RfC page, click on [[Talk:Domestic violence#WP:Alternative name policy and separating terminology on an arbitrary basis]] for the initial part of the discussion. One concern is that the current wording of "Domestic violence (DV) (also known as family violence or domestic abuse)" neglects the "spousal abuse, intimate partner violence, battering" terminology, which, per [[WP:Alternative names]], is well-served there, and subsequently makes it seem that domestic violence is different than couple violence. The current lead sentence neglects defining domestic violence as a couple issue at all. The other concern is that "family violence is not spousal abuse," and "Perhaps a solution may be to call this article family violence instead, and keep the intimate partner violence article? Family violence currently re-directs to the DV article. Family violence encompasses so much more than spousal abuse, as does the body of this current article." Previous [[WP:Consensus]], seen at [[Talk:Domestic violence/Archive 5#Alternative names for domestic violence (WP:Alternative title)]], was to keep the "spousal abuse, intimate partner violence, battering" terminology in the lead sentence because domestic violence generally refers to [[intimate partner violence]] (as does most of the article); it was agreed that we'd leave the Definitions section to address the ways the terms are at times distinguished; see [[Domestic violence#Definitions]]. So is the current lead sentence best for the article? Below are what sources state on the terminology matter. I will alert [[WP:Med]] to this WP:RfC.

6.

Among the various terms used in the literature, Robinson (2010: 245) lists: 'Wife abuse, battered women, domestic violence, domestic abuse, spousal abuse, spousal assault, family violence, violence against women, intimate partner violence, gender-based violence'. Some of these terms have become outdated; for example, it is now judged entirely appropriate to include within this grouping partners who are not married and partners of the same sex alongside those who are married."

13. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CBugBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA162 This] 2014 ''Violence: From Theory to Research'' source, from Routledge, page 162, states, "Intimate partner violence is a term that is specific to intimate relationships and is preferred to other terms, such as domestic violence or family violence, because the latter terms can refer to violence against elders or between other family members, including children." The same source, however, notes, "Some of the common terms used to describe intimate partner violence are domestic abuse, spouse abuse, courtship violence, battering, marital rape, and date rape."

14.

I've noticed a decline in discussion about possible disambiguation of this page. So I'm proposing some text for a disambiguation page to get the discussion rolling again:

:"'''''Cultural Marxism may refer to:'''''

::''• A common conservative Conspiracy Theory - known as Cultural Marxism in which Marxists occupying Academic positions have initiated the decline of Western Civilization.''

::''• Cultural Marxism may also refer to Marxist currents within Cultural Studies.''"

I think this would allow people to make up their own minds as to the aspect of this subject they're interested in. What do other editors think? --[[User:Jobrot|Jobrot]] ([[User talk:Jobrot|talk]]) 06:34, 3 December 2015 (UTC)}}

# Addition of the ingredients, even though not a recipe in the strictest sense, can be used as the basis of a recipe, thus it places Wikipedia in a position where the laws of the land are being violated (Purple Drank is illegal).

I've been witness to several instances where editors managed to circumvent [[WP:UP#POLEMIC]]. It is my suggestion to further clarify on the policy that poetic militancy (similar to [http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/iamknife-jesuiscouteau-hashtag-supports-tel-aviv-stabbing-attack/2015/01/22/ "#JeSuisCouteau"], [http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=157&doc_id=16156 "will of the people"], and [http://palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=157&doc_id=16126 "my land will not be humiliated"]) is not permissible. Promotion of militancy (a.k.a. "Mukawama", "Jihad") is illegal in several countries, e.g., the UK,[http://jurist.org/paperchase/2006/11/uk-court-dismisses-muslim-clerics.php][http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/anjem-choudary-will-face-trial-inciting-support-islamic-state-january-1517506] France,[http://www.breitbart.example.com/london/2015/10/29/french-court-rules-anti-israel-boycotts-inciting-hate/] Australia.[https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/racial-vilification-law-australia] My understanding is that "Polemical statements unrelated to Wikipedia, or statements attacking or vilifying" does not require content to be illegal. However, if paraphrases about the righteousness of militancy are sometimes passable law-wise, it does not make them right for the Wiki-project. <b><font face="Arial" color="teal">[[User:Jaakobou|Jaakobou]]</font><font color="1F860E"><sup>''[[User talk:Jaakobou|Chalk Talk]]''</sup></font></b> 12:13, 12 November 2015 (UTC)}}

I've reverted the article back to the shortened RJL, primarily as it is a summary of a technical document for the road, and because this is an encyclopedia article, [[WP:NOT|not a travel guide]].  In particular, it is for these reasons:
* A fair number of the roads mentioned in the RJL have little to no notability in themselves. Just because they happen to link to the [[HEFT]] does not give them notability, and thus notability in terms of SR 997. If Campbell Drive and Biscayne Drive were State Roads, then they could be added.
* SR 9336 does not go to Biscayne National Park, only the Everglades. While Biscayne could be reached from using SR 9336; again, it is not contextual in terms of SR 997 as it requires additional travel on a number of non-State Roads. It could also be reached using other means, from what I can tell on a map.
* Miami Dade College Homestead is not situated on Krome Avenue, which is why it is not mentioned in the route description and thus should not be mentioned in the RJL.
* There is currently not enough verifiable information on [[Florida State Road 5A|Former SR 5A]] to merit its inclusion in the RJL. If additional information was provided, then it could be included.

'''Introduction'''

[[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship|Requests for adminship]] (or RfA) is the process by which [[WP:ADMIN|administrators]] are selected by the community, (theoretically) via the process of [[WP:CONSENSUS|consensus]]. However, the RfA process has been subject to a great deal of discussion over the past few years, and there is general agreement among the community that the process has problems. Therefore, many attempts have been made to fix the process, including (but not limited to) [[WP:RFA2011]] and [[WP:RFA2013]]. In 2014 and 2015 combined, there were four months with no promotions (such months were completely nonexistent between 2003–2011; there was one in 2012, and none in 2013). In a [[Wikipedia_talk:Requests for adminship/Archive 239#RfC: English Wikipedia needs to produce more admins|recent RfC]], there was over 75% support for the notion that we are not producing enough admins. Therefore, a new project was recently started: [[WP:RFA2015]]. The project is divided into three phases. The first phase consisted of [[Wikipedia:2015 administrator election reform/Phase I/RfC|an RfC]] (October 15, 2015–November 15, 2015), in which we successfully attempted to identify the actual problems with RfA. The following concepts passed the Phase I RfC: (1) RfA needs more participants; (2) The load on admins should be eased [perhaps via automated mechanisms]; (3) RfA is a hostile environment; (4) The discretionary range [the range of support in which [[WP:CRAT|bureaucrats]] can use discretion in closing RfAs] is too narrow; (5) The standards at RfA are too high; (6) We need active clerking at RfA; (7) The standards at RfA should be defined; (8) It is too difficult to remove admins [the discussion here was actually very close, so it was left as "discretionary", or optional, for the next phases]. Proposals (2) and (8) are not covered in this RfC, since they are not directly related to RfA. Proposal (6) will be handled in a [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Clerking proposal 2015|separate RfC]], which is currently on hold until this one ends. 

This RfC is the successor to the Phase I RfC. The goal of this RfC is to reach actual solutions for the problems identified in Phase I. Participants will examine the proposals set forth on this page and indicate whether they support or oppose those proposals in the proper sections. Comments on specific proposals should be placed in the comments section for that proposal, while general comments about the RfC should be placed the talk page. Since this proposal may have substantial effects on the RfA process, it will be as widely advertised as possible. Thirty days after the opening of the RfC, it will be closed. The closer will determine which proposals attained consensus according to the process described at [[Wikipedia:Consensus#Determining consensus]]. Problems for which a solution is not found in this RfC will be further discussed at a later point.

The abortive [[Greco-Italian War|Italian invasion of Greece]] (from Albania) which commenced on 28 October 1940 was quickly countered by the Greeks with some British air support, and ended in a stalemate inside Albanian territory. The [[Battle of Greece|German-led Axis invasion]] (over the Greek borders with Bulgaria and Yugoslavia) commenced on 6 April 1941 and led to the rapid defeat of Greek and British forces in Greece, and Greek forces in Albania. Greek forces surrendered on 23 April, and British forces began evacuating the same day. A separate article exists which focuses on the German-led Axis invasion. What should be the scope (ie the matters included in the main body) of <u>this</u> article be?

I feel drawn to open an RFC to see if the community agrees with the close. 73.162.132.47 should be blocked, as it's clearly a sock of 169.230.155.123; clerks refuse to even allow an SPI to ''mention'' the IP.  As far as I can tell, a checkuser is totally called for in this case. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Elvey/169.230.155.123 link to case (link edited to refer to editable copy since live copy has been disrupted)], which includes detailed argument backed by policy and IIRC, common practice. 

RFC: '''Should a CheckUser be run in this case?'''  Why/Why not?  73.162.132.47 should be blocked?  Why is this being covered up?

Summary: SPI reported socking and requested a checkuser because multiple IPs are editing the same articles and tells indicate the master is very experienced [Edit: and we have [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Valsartan/sacubitril&diff=693923274&oldid=693920488 an admission].]  It's confirmed that there's socking, but no checkuser is done; the close is:

"*Two sock IPs blocked for 3 days, master IP warned. Range-block is not possible, as the range is very large. CheckUser can't help here, it is used only to compare named accounts, not anonymous IPs. I'm closing the case. '''<sig of Vanjagenije>"

The fourth IP was not blocked; the involved Admin and CheckUser refuse to block it '''OR explain why'''.  They refuse to check if other IPs are the same (not-logged-in) user, arguing nonsensically that the privacy policy doesn't allow it - while policy doesn't allow (logged-in) accounts to be publicly connected to IPs; connections between IPs are allowed.  [Edit: There's a bunch of bluster and distraction in the replies below.]

There is a debate on how we should include a widely reported statistic relating to the percentage of victims, who when asked why they didn't report the incident, answered they didn't think it was "serious enough" per the study and news reports.

The section leads with a high level statistic for the rates of all types of sexual assault and misconduct, "The 2015 Association of American Universities (AAU) Campus Survey on Sexual Assault, one of the largest studies ever of college sexual violence, drew responses from 150,000 students at 27 schools, including most of the Ivy League. It found that more than 20 percent of female and 5 percent of male undergraduates said that they were victims of sexual assault and misconduct".

The AAU study, [https://www.aau.edu/uploadedFiles/AAU_Publications/AAU_Reports/Sexual_Assault_Campus_Survey/Report%20on%20the%20AAU%20Campus%20Climate%20Survey%20on%20Sexual%20Assault%20and%20Sexual%20Misconduct.pdf Table 6-1, page 110] contains the following:

{| class="wikitable"
! Percentage reporting or not, with reason
! Penetration by Force
! Penetration by Incapacitation
! Sexual Touching by Force
! Sexual Touching by Incapacitation
|-
| ''Contacted at least one program in university list''
| 25.5%
| 13.3%
| 7.0%
| 5.0%
|-
| ''Did not contact any programs'' reason: "I did not think it was serious enough to report"
| 58.6%
| 62.1%
| 74.1%
| 75.6%
|}
Several news reports that covered the high level findings in AAU survey also included the following details from page 110.  I have provided a few samples (with direct quotes provided):

* Washington Post, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/09/23/the-latest-big-sexual-assault-survey-is-like-others-more-hype-than-science/ "the vast majorities of poll respondents who said they had not reported to campus authorities the events that the AAU classified as sexual assaults — 'the dominant reason was it was not considered serious enough,']
* Chicago Tribune, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-college-rape-survey-edit-0924-20150923-story.html "More than half of those who didn't report a rape said they didn't think it was serious enough to report."]

* CNN [http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/22/health/campus-sexual-assault-new-large-survey/index.html "More than 50 percent of the women who reported some of the most serious incidents, including forced penetration, didn’t report it because they didn’t think it was “serious enough,” according to the survey."]

* Campus Safety Magazine, [http://www.campussafetymagazine.com/article/aau_releases_sexual_assault_survey "When students were asked why they did not report incidents of sexual assault and sexual misconduct, the most common reason was that it was not considered serious enough."]

Looking for input on two approaches discussed in this talk page to handle this:

# In the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_sexual_assault#2015_Campus_Climate_Surveys 2015 Campus Climate Survey section], add language with some of the multiple cites including the AAU study along the lines of, "The survey also reported that the majority of students whose responses were classified as sexual assault did not think their experience was "serious enough to report"."
# Only include this finding in the '''2015 Campus Climate Survey''' if it includes criticisms/counterpoints to these kinds of finding about surveys in general, making points like, "First, a salient research issue is what students mean when they define incidents as not serious enough to report. For conservatives, the phrase "not serious" is taken in a strictly literal sense as meaning that the incidents were unimportant. For feminists, however, such a response may merely indicate a false consciousness expressed by women acculturated to see their victimization as somehow acceptable."

'''Basic point:''' Should this article become a redirect that carries the reader directly to [[Heathenry (new religious movement)]]?

'''Wider explanation:''' This article is devoted to Odinism, which is a term that a minority of practitioners of the [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] religion of Heathenry prefer to use in reference to their religion. As it stands, this article is in an absolutely terrible state. It consists almost entirely of material that is not-referenced, material that is cited to non-reliable, primary and self-published sources, and material on pre-Christian belief systems which are being used to bolster claims about this [[new religious movement]]. The latter has been placed there by practitioners of the religious movement in question, and reflects their own belief that the modern religion really is a direct continuation of the extinct belief system; this is not a position supported in the academic literature on either pre-Christian belief systems among the Germanic peoples or on the modern Pagan religion, and thus it is being used to simply un-critically promote an Odinist (or one Odinist's) view about their religion. Accordingly, all of this material absolutely has to be deleted.

As it stands, the vast majority of this article was written by [[User:ThorLives]], and is currently being stubbornly defended from deletion by [[User:Holtj]], who is engaging in [[WP:Edit war|Edit Warring]] in order to do so. ThorLives is currently the subject of a debated Topic Ban [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard#Community_discussion_regarding_disruptive_edits_to_Heathenry-themed_articles here] as a result of their longstanding [[WP:Disruptive Editing|Disruptive Editing]] to Heathenry-themed articles, and there is also a Sock Puppet investigation [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Holtj#18_November_2015 here] examining whether ThorLives and Holtj are one and the same individual. As [[User:Snowded]] pointed out over at [[Talk:Heathenry (new religious movement)]], ThorLives simply developed the Odinism article as a [[WP:Coatrack|Coatrack]] to present the Heathen religion (to which they belonged) in a manner of their choosing; they did so after myself and other editors put a stop to their disruptive editing over at the Heathenry article itself. It was made abundantly clear to ThorLives in the discussions at that page that the quality of their contributions was sub-par and in contravention of Wikipedia's [[WP:Identifying reliable sources|Reliable Sources]] policy, however they used exactly the same sources (and lack of them) when expanding the Odinism article too. Textbook disruptive editing.

It is undeniable that the improperly referenced material should be removed and that Holtj should desist from re-adding it in their desire to preserve ThorLives' (poor quality) contributions. However, if that is removed then there is basically nothing left of the article except a few passages that duplicate what is already said over at the Heathenry article. Given this, as well as the fact that "Odinism" is essentially a partial synonym for Heathenry, and indeed that the Odinism article was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Odinism&oldid=295619634 originally created as a redirect to start with], I believe that this article should be converted into a redirect to [[Heathenry (new religious movement)]].

Reviewers checked only that the scientific content of the paper had not changed."

It is my view that this paper does not support the statement. I have no issue with including a link to the paper within this article, since it's clearly relevant, but as I think I have made clear, ''that is not the place''. To include it as a source for the fact of republication is technically [[WP:OR]] and in any case is unnecessary as the existing secondary source covers it. To include it where it is, as a source for the review process, is simply wrong, as the paper itself does not cover this.

The options appear to be:
# Include the reference as a source for ''In June 2014 Séralini republished the article in the journal ''[[Environmental Sciences Europe]]'', which did not conduct any further [[peer review]]. Reviewers checked only that the scientific content of the paper had not changed.''
# Include the paper within the article, but not as a reference fir this para.
# Include the paper within the para as a reference for the fact of republication only (i.e. after the journal name).

At [[WP:AFC]] and in the main namespace we are seeing many outputs from the [[Wikipedia:Education program]] from students who are led with varying degrees of skill by their course leaders. Many of these are less than stellar creations, requiring editors to clean up behind the courses, the more so when material has been moved into main namespace prematurely. Some are excellent.

The overall objective must always be to improve Wikipedia. This is anticipated to be by having suitable articles or edits to articles as an end product, together with students whose experience has been positive and who may stay on as active editors, and course leaders who have had the best experience possible so that they generate more and more of the previous two items.

Rather than discussing this on a course by course basis, I am inviting all interested parties to discuss the matter on the Education Noticeboard, the place that seems the most appropriate home. I have set out some bullets for discussion, and added one proposal

What I hope to see is encapsulated as including:

#A new namespace, “Coursework:” in which the students create their drafts
#Some form of licence for the course leader. Use of Wikipedia should be a hard won privilege, not a right
#Excellence of support for the course leader
#Excellence of tuition by the course leader
#Increasing competence of the student leading to finished main space articles
#A formal process (cf [[WP:AFC]]) for acceptance of student articles into main namespace
#Obvious identification of student coursework. Some students/instructors fail on this
#Cleaning up at the end of the course, by the course leader. Courses often leave less then acceptable material in all sorts of places, including the article space
#Happy students, some of whom become editors here after the course is over
#Happy course leaders

None of this discussion is intended to detract from the excellent job done by the education team. Instead it is intended to be useful to them and to offer them assistance, and conceivably to be used by them to justify additional paid staff.

You may wish to add other items to the list. Please do. You may also find other formal proposals to make. Please do [[User:Timtrent|<span style="color:#800">Fiddle</span>]] [[User talk:Timtrent|<span style="color:#070">Faddle</span>]] 14:03, 4 December 2015 (UTC)}}

Topic: ''Allow stewards and global admins to help with countervandalism''

Dear all, 

At the talk page of [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship#Easing the load on admins|WP:RFA]] Biblioworm asked for ideas on how to lighten the load on admins. This as a follow up of the [[Wikipedia:2015 administrator election reform/Phase I/RfC|Phase I RfC]] for the [[WP:RFA2015|RFA2015]] reform project, which showed community consensus that we should somehow try to lighten the load on admins. I made a suggestion and a bureaucrat indicated that it was an interesting idea, but it needed to be developed and put forward at a different venue. As such, I would like to ask you for feedback on my proposal below. 

I suggest we allow [[:meta:Stewards|stewards]] and [[:meta:Global sysops|global admins]] to help with blocking straight forward vandalism (ip, logged in vandal) and let them delete obvious spam pages. The users are trusted and experienced with this type of work. Letting stewards delete obvious pages is already [[:meta:Meta:Meta–steward relationship#Administrative actions on Meta|policy on meta]] and works fine for the local admins. Among the global-admins are the most active and experienced vandal fighters in the world. Such a change would represent a significant increase in vandal fighting admins and take away a huge load. Moreover it would give en.wiki experience to the global users, who might afterwards become more active here or even apply for adminship here and help the English Wikipedia even more. It is a win-win situation. 

I would greatly appricate your input. What do you think. Do we want this. If yes, how can we make this proposal more specific. What checks do we need. Issues to consider. Would the [[:meta:Meta:Meta–steward relationship#Administrative actions on Meta|policy on meta]] be applicable? How to proceed. Thank you very much. 

Sincerely, [[User:Taketa|Taketa]] ([[User talk:Taketa|talk]]) 08:12, 15 December 2015 (UTC)}}

Should East Jerusalem and Golan Heights be included in the list based on the criteria specified in the article lead?
I'm not going to edit the article but I want to point out the hypocrisy here:
The article states as follows:

"Military occupation is effective provisional control of a certain power over a territory which is not under the formal sovereignty of that entity, without the volition of the actual sovereign.[2][3][4] Military occupation is distinguished from annexation by its intended temporary nature (i.e. no claim for permanent sovereignty), by its military nature, and by citizenship rights of the controlling power not being conferred upon the subjugated population."

Therefore, if a country annexes a territory AND grants citizenship, that territory should NOT be placed in this list. (That does NOT mean it's not occupied, but it is NOT military occupation.) East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights have been annexed by Israel and the residents have been granted FULL citizenship by Israel. Therefore, based on what the list criteria is, should not be included in the list.

{{rfcquote|text=
In response to a couple of instances where [[WP:BRFA|bot requests]] have been made for mass-removal of navboxes from articles on which they're not bidirectional, I wanted to double check that [[WP:BIDIRECTIONAL]] was actually a valid, consensus-backed portion of this guideline and not simply something that creeped in and stuck around&mdash;at least, before approving any more bots based on the assumption that there's consensus for it (as each subsequent bot could be affecting thousands of pages).  It was added in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories,_lists,_and_navigation_templates&diff=492475231&oldid=492442886 this edit] [[Wikipedia_talk:Categories,_lists,_and_navigation_templates/Archive_5#Stating_the_obvious|without objection or support]] a few years ago, and while silence ''can'' be assumed to be consensus (plus it's been a while), it would help to have a definitive answer when dealing with subsequent bot requests (at the very least).  Additionally, it appears that a few edit wars have happened over the years in relation to it, possibly grounded in a false assumption of original consensus.

;Main questions

1. '''Does the current text of [[WP:BIDIRECTIONAL]] have broad consensus as part of this guideline?''' ("BIDIRECTIONAL has consensus in this guideline," below) {{Quote|"Every article that transcludes a given navbox should normally also be included as a link in the navbox so that the navigation is bidirectional."|[[WP:BIDIRECTIONAL]] current text}}

2. '''Do navboxes containing a List imply that a member of the List can be treated as if it were linked from the navbox?''' ("List members are valid exception," below) For example, if <nowiki>{{Cool Stuff Navbox}} contains [[List of frozen things]], which contains [[Ice cubes]], should it be assumed that {{Cool Stuff Navbox}} can be placed on [[Ice cubes]]</nowiki>?

3. '''Can the [[WP:BAG|Bot Approvals Group]] (BAG) assume, in the future, that there's community consensus to approve bots that reflect these guidelines without individualized consensus for each case/template?''' ("BAG can assume there are rarely exceptions," below) An example of such a request (actually, what prompted me to double check) is [[Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/KoehlBot]], which seeks to remove {{Tlx|Zoos}} from articles not directly listed in the navbox.  Note this question is directly dependent on the consensus of #1 and/or #2, so you don't have to re-hash arguments from either of them.  It's more a gauge of how strongly the result can be implemented.  For example:
:*If #1 has support, AND you '''support''' this question, then we'll assume that bot requests that seek to enforce #1 (like the aforementioned example) have support by default (regardless of the navbox).
:*Similarly, if #2 has support AND you '''support''' this question, we'll by-default seek to ensure that bot requests take inclusion of a member article in a list into consideration so as to avoid accidental removal of a navbox from that member, too (unless there's consensus to the contrary).
:*'''Opposing''' this question will encourage the BAG to make sure any bot request pertaining to BIDIRECTIONAL gains some sort of individual consensus each time (e.g., on a template talk page or wikiproject).  That is, we'll assume there are frequent exceptions to the guideline, which necessitates that each request should probably double check with the template's talk page and/or associated Wikiproject(s) to ensure mass removal is what's appropriate for that instance.

Thanks for your help, guys, and cheers =)

In the one case, there is the recognition that the term is used differently in different contexts (as it should be in section 4.1), while in the other case (section 3.3.1) the article forces one and only one translation upon the reader without indicating the common alternate translations.

'''Question''': Should the below material be included in the [[Italian invasion of France]] article?

{{blockquote|"In September 1939, Britain imposed a selective blockade of Italy. Coal from Germany, which was shipped out of Rotterdam, was declared contraband. The Germans promised to keep up shipments by train, over the Alps, and Britain offered to supply all of Italy's needs in exchange for Italian armaments. The Italians could not agree to the latter terms without shattering their alliance with Germany.[28] On 2 February 1940, however, Mussolini approved a draft contract with the Royal Air Force to provide 400 Caproni aircraft; yet he scrapped the deal on 8 February. The British intelligence officer, Francis Rodd, believed that Mussolini was convinced to reverse policy by German pressure in the week of 2–8 February, a view shared by the British ambassador in Rome, Percy Loraine.[29] On 1 March, the British announced that they would block all coal exports from Rotterdam to Italy.[28][29] Italian coal was one of the most discussed issues in diplomatic circles in the spring of 1940. In April Britain began strengthening their Mediterranean Fleet to enforce the blockade. Despite French misgivings, Britain rejected concessions to Italy so as not to "create an impression of weakness".[30] Germany supplied Italy with about one million tons of coal a month beginning in the spring of 1940, an amount that even exceeded Mussolini's demand of August 1939 that Italy receive six million tons of coal for its first twelve months of war.[31]"}}

I've added this sentence to the article lead.

:''The most troubling part of the Wikipedia censorship is the one carried by Wikipedia administrators and groups of users led by specific interests outside the idea of encyclopedism.''

The sentence above was deleted and qualified as a personal opinion. Based on the comments on this page, and many other comments on many other places, I see that this type of censorship is visible and the most harmful one to Wikipedia.

Initially I do not want to provide the examples. There are many. Leaving it to someone else to start with.

There arose a dispute about the proper extent of the Duke of Windsor's wartime activities in regards the German Nazi regime. An editor feels that the pro-Nazi sympathies and activities, including one act that in his personal view is an act of treason, is not reflected with the appropriate due weight in the article, and believes that the insertion of an extract of a German embassy cable should be added, as a footnote. Another editor feels that quoting the entire text of the cable is overkill, and that overall the article is consistent with the views that are presented in scholarly discourse and presents them with due weight and cites them to reliable sources. </br>
The question is put forth to Wikipedia editors whether to '''Support''' the addition of the contested material in a footnote or '''Oppose''' it. For illustrative purposes, the extract from the cable is quoted herebelow in full:
<blockquote>124/122669 Minister Zech to State Secretary Weizsäcker SECRET, The Hague, February 19, 1940. Dear Weizsäcker: The Duke of W., about whom I wrote to you in my letter of the 27th of last month, has said that the Allied War Council devoted an exhaustive discussion at its last meeting to the situation that would arise if Germany invaded Belgium. Reference was made throughout to a German invasion plan said to have been found in an airplane that made a forced landing in Belgium. On the military side, it was held that the best plan would be to make the main resistance effort in the line behind the Belgian-French border, even at the risk that Belgium should be occupied by us. The political authorities are said to have at first opposed this plane: after the humiliation suffered in Poland, it would be impossible to surrender Belgium and the Netherlands also to the Germans. In the end, however, the political authorities became more yielding. Heil Hitler! Zech</blockquote> 14:00, 25 November 2015 (UTC)}}

== Are names a style issue or a content issue (or both)? '''

As a follow on from the (now closed) RFC regarding MOS:IDENTITY (above)... I think part of the reason ''why'' we did not reach a completely clear consensus is that there is a fundamental (underlying) question that has not yet been asked: Is the MOS the right ''venue'' to deal with the issue? <br> 
Should the question of what NAME to use when referring to someone in an article really fall within the scope of our MOS guidance?  I suspect that many editors would say "no"... considering the question of what NAME to use when referring to people to be a question of ''fact'' (a content issue resolved by examining sources and ''not'' a style issue to be resolved by our own internal style guidance).  I also suspect that many other editors will disagree with that contention, and say "yes"... that it should be something that is governed by MOS guidance.  Whichever view one holds... That is a fairly fundamental difference of opinion. I think we need to reach a consensus (if we can) on this fundamental question before we can properly resolve the issues presented at the RFC. So... I ask the question:  Should the issue of what NAMES to use really be subject to MOS guidance in the first place?

== Record tables '''

In record tables (e.g., [[Manny_Pacquiao#Professional_boxing_record|Manny Pacquiao's]]), the type column shows the type of result as KO, UD, MD, SD, RTD, or TKO. However, the values are wiki-linked to the page about the particular fight (if there is one), instead of an explanation of the meaning of the abbreviations. I believe the average non-boxing-fan, who might recognize KO, is unlikely to know what RTD means (I didn't). Also, it's not apparent which abbreviations are used for the various types of draw outcomes, "D" already being used for the "decision" values.

I suggest that the link to the fight should instead be from the date or the result (win/loss) column, and the type values should be linked to the explanatory page or section (e.g. [[Unanimous decision|UD]]). Alternatively, have a footnote with a table of the possible values with short descriptions linked to the explanatory pages. I'd suggest a template be used for the rows to ensure consistent formatting and make it easier to change things if needed (like add mouse-over alt-text with the descriptions). <font color="red">—&#91;</font>[[User:AlanM1|<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><font color="green">Alan</font><font color="blue">M</font><font color="purple">1</font></span>]]([[User talk:AlanM1#top|talk]])<font color="red">&#93;—</font> 00:24, 26 November 2015 (UTC)}}

'''Basic question''': Should the Wikipedia articles on [[Asatru]] and [[Ásatrú]] both redirect to [[Heathenry (new religious movement)]]?

'''More information''': At present, the article on [[Asatru]] serves as a redirect to [[Ásatrú]], which is a disambiguation page. I would suggest that both articles should be converted into redirects that take the reader straight to [[Heathenry (new religious movement)]]. In effect, the Icelandic term "Ásatrú", and its Anglicised spelling of "Asatru", are synonyms for a [[new religious movement]] that is termed "Heathenry" within the academic literature on the subject. To quote from the (academically sourced, GA-rated) Wikipedia article on Heathenry:

:Another name for the faith is the Icelandic ''Ásatrú'', which is more commonly rendered as ''Asatru'' in North America; this term translates as "allegiance to the [[Æsir]]" &ndash; the latter being a sub-set of deities in [[Norse mythology]] &ndash; with practitioners being known as ''Asatruer''.{{sfnm|1a1=Blain|1y=2002|1p=5|2a1=Strmiska|2a2=Sigurvinsson|2y=2005|2p=128|3a1=Adler|3y=2006|3p=286|4a1=Harvey|4y=2007|4p=53|5a1=Snook|5y=2015|5p=9}} This term is favored by practitioners who focus on the deities of Scandinavia,{{sfn|Strmiska|Sigurvinsson|2005|p=128}} although is problematic as many Asatruer worship deities and entities other than the Æsir, such as the [[Vanir]], [[valkyries]], [[Elf|elves]], and [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]].{{sfnm|1a1=Strmiska|1y=2000|1p=113|2a1=Amster|2y=2015|2pp=44&ndash;45}} Although initially a popular term of self-designation, usage of ''Ásatrú'' has declined as the religion has aged, particularly in Scandinavia.{{sfn|Gregorius|2015|p=65}}

I believe that this should be a fairly un-controversial change and would like to gain consensus in support of it from various otherwise un-involved editors. Other articles devoted to synonyms for Heathenry (such as [[Vanatru]] and [[Forn Sed]]) already exist as redirects that take the reader straight to it, and I believe that these two articles should join them.

==Background'''

{{imbox|text=The current policy, which can be viewed at [[WP:INACTIVITY]] is reproduced here for convenience:

Admin accounts which have made no edits or administrative actions for at least 12 months may be desysopped.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/suspend sysop rights of inactive admins]], June 2011</ref> Subject to the [[#Lengthy inactivity]] consideration below, this desysopping is not to be considered permanent, or a reflection on the user's use of, or rights to, the admin tools. The admin must be contacted on their user talk page and via e-mail (if possible) one month before the request for desysopping and again several days before the desysopping goes into effect. Desysopping on inactivity grounds should be handled by English Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|bureaucrats]]. The summary in the user rights log should make it clear that the desysopping is purely procedural.

If necessary, the user's userpage should be edited to clarify the status&nbsp;— particularly if any categorization is involved. For example, the userbox <tt>{{tl|User wikipedia/Administrator}}</tt> should be replaced with <tt>{{tlx|1=User wikipedia/Former administrator|2=inactive=yes}}</tt>.

''' Lengthy inactivity '''

If an editor has had at least three years of uninterrupted inactivity (no edits) between the removal of the admin tools and the re-request, regardless of the reason for removal, the editor will need to instead request through the [[WP:RFA]] process.

In the case of an administrator desysopped due to inactivity, if, after the one year of inactivity which led to the desysopping due to inactivity, there is a subsequent two years of continued inactivity (no edits), then, if the editor returns after that, they will no longer be able to merely re-request the admin tools, but instead will need to request adminship through the [[WP:RFA]] process. Again, this means there is a total of at least three uninterrupted years of inactivity.

}}

The above policy was established in 2011. Prior to that time, there were no activity requirements at all for administrators. After four-and-a-half years under this new policy, a review seems in order.

'''Example cases'''

{{imbox|text=I would like to be clear that I have no personal argument with these admins and do not mean to accuse them of acting in bad faith. These are not the only examples, just some that were easy to find and seem particularly problematic. You may ask "why not just talk to them about it?" The answer is that this is not about a problem with these particular admins, but rather a problem with our inactivity policy. This is therefore a problem only the community can fix.

{{rfcquote|text=
Other articles, generally outside the context of recognized religions, that involve belief systems which have not been factually verified make this clear either in the text of the article (usually in the introductory section) or by referencing articles that make this clear. So far, Christianity (and, I believe, many of its fellow religions) have gotten special treatment in this regard. It is time, in my opinion, for this to end, which would make the Christianity article consistent with the other articles regarding unverified claims. For example, the following articles all make it clear that the views of the adherents, or the beings in questions, have no confirmed factual basis: [[astrology]], [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]], [[troll]], [[fairy]], [[leprechaun]]. The first three of these ([[astrology]], [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]]) state flatly in the introduction section that the claims have no verified factual basis. The latter three of these ([[troll]], [[fairy]], [[leprechaun]]) refer, directly or indirectly, to the [[mythology]] article which makes clear that the beings have no verified factual basis. This is not the case with this article, which states various claims by adherents, including stating that "Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity," but does not tell the reader that Christians have not backed up these claims with evidence. This article does reference the [[religion]] article, but that article does not make clear that the claims of various of the religions are not factually verified, nor, I think should it because not all religions necessarily make claims with no verified factual basis.

The fact that Christianity and some of the other specific religions do not have the same type of disclaimer language, stating that the adherents believe things that they cannot back up with evidence, as is found in the other similar types of articles ([[astrology]], [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]], [[troll]], [[fairy]], [[leprechaun]]) is misleading and a disservice to the readers of Wikipedia entries, who are not put on notice that the claims and assertions are not backed up with any evidence. There is no reason NOT to put the reader on notice of this when reading this material, and the failure to do so heretofore is, I suspect, an example of bias in favor of Christianity (and its fellow religions). I decided to start with this article, since Christianity is the most popular religion worldwide, but my edit was reverted.

Bottom line: specific religions, including Christianity, that make factual claims with no verifiable basis should be treated the same way as the other belief systems ([[astrology]], etc.) that make these types of claims, and should no longer be given special treatment. I have tried engaging on this with other editors but have not had much success with this obvious point so am submitting this RFC.

I'm curious if the community actually agrees that these categories are legitimate on this and similar articles. Some of the potential issues raised:
* Nothing in this article's [[WP:Verifiablity|sourced content]] suggests that Carey actually [[MOS:IDENTITY|self-identifies]] as African-American, only that she's said that being of mixed ethnic background caused familial tensions and some social challenges growing up.
* Reaching from such a statement to an assumption about how Carey identifies and should be categorized (i.e. labelled by Wikipedia) may be [[WP:No original research|novel analysis and interpretation]].
* This is especially risky, and countermanded, in a [[WP:BLP|biography of a living person]].
* It may also even advance the controversial, anti-scientific, and politically loaded "[[one-drop rule]]" in [[WP:Neutral point of view|Wikipedia's own voice]].
* Most Americans with diverse ethno-cultural backgrounds do not self-identify as, and resist pigeonholing as "an anything" in particular and singularly.
* It's noteworthy that we have not categorized this subject as a "Venezuelan American singer-songwriter" or more generally a "Hispanic American singer-songwriter", nor as an "Irish American singer-songwriter", or anything else.
* It may not be sufficient that some sources might want to label Carey in particular ways for their own reasons and in their own contexts.
* [[WP:NOT#GENEALOGY|Wikipedia is not a genealogy work]]; pigeonholing subjects with iffy micro-categorization trivia representing everyone's ancestral heritage in detail is not relevant to [[WP:ENC|WP's encyclopedia mission and purpose]]. 
* This may raise similar concerns to categorizing someone who is in a heterosexual [or homosexual, take your pick] marriage as "bisexual" just because they said they once had a homosexual [or hetero, if you want to reverse it] encounter.
* Singling out "Africanness" as something to especially categorize seems inappropriate [[WP:SOAPBOX|dwelling]], whether it's being done for [[WP:NOT#ADVOCACY|positive]] or [[WP:BATTLEGROUND|negative]] reasons.
These are general concerns, not limited to Carey's case in particular.  In short, I'm skeptical we'd ever categorize someone as a "Jewish American {{var|whatever}}" on the basis of partial ancestry and a few sources engaging in such labelling, absent unequivocal use/acceptance of such a label by the subject, at least for a [[WP:BLP]].<br />{{small|1=[I'm including this as a titles/style RfC as well as the other categories, since it could affect use of ethnic terms in [[WP:PARENDIS|parenthetic disambiguation]].]}}<br /><span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 22:19, 28 November 2015 (UTC)}}

Edit: note that the earlier discussion was about whether it was to be mainly described as a pejorative at all.

In the case that editors have looked for speaker figures, but have not found any, they can set the parameter {{para|speakers}} of [[Template:Infobox language]] to <code>?</code>. This currently causes the infobox to display “'''Native speakers''' (no data)”. There are two questions:

#If we should display something, then what should it say?

Album sales figures in this article's [[The Game discography#Studio albums|"Studio albums"]] table were recently increased, and the sourcing has become problematic.

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
My proposal is to add the new section to this article: Censorship by groups of users and administrators. This type of censorship is based on arbitrary interpretation and use of
*3RR
*NPOV
*Disruptive editing
*Sockpuppetry

against others. 

There are countless cases where one user (say user A) changes the article content which then gets removed by other user (user B). If  user A  tries to put it back, then he will be warned by an administrator saying " you are about to violate 3RR, you will be blocked even if you do not violate 3RR" etc. If user A puts back his content and another user (user C) reverts it, then regularly, no matter what is the content change quality, the user A is always guilty party. The attempt to resolve dispute will fail along the same irrational line of the context change refusal.

The NPOV rule is in use if some administrator or group of users does not want accept the changes 'justified' by disqualifications of the user A (POV pusher, references are not neutral, etc)

Disruptive editing is a generic accusation against user A which regularly never gets  justified or elaborated. It's an un-articulated, many times, irrational disagreement to the changes not acceptable by others which are always a small group of users.

Sockpuppetry is many times a tool to discourage or prevent support to changes not acceptable by a group or by an administrator. If there is no way to prove that the users are using the same IP address, then they might be accused for being in the same geographical area, or for sharing the same interest, showing the same behavior, or by grammar style. All these disqualifications are never elaborated nor proven.

Complaints against block and disqualifications of user A  are almost regularly refused, ridiculed, or answered by additional accusations or pointlessly calling on Wikipedia rules and essays. The essays used against user A, like WP:DUCK, are qualified as not a part of Wikipedia policy and yet used as an ultimate tool against user A.--[[User:X2Faces|X2Faces]] ([[User talk:X2Faces|talk]]) 23:30, 26 December 2015 (UTC)}}
