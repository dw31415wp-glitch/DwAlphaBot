This has been a defining principle of this community for many a year, and our consensus-building model has gained us much interest from scholars who want to examine it, and normal people who are excited at the fact that even they can make great changes to one of the most visited and viewed websites on the planet. "The thing about Wikipedia," it is said, {{plain link|http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2007/10/14/the-thing-about-wikipedia-is-that-it-only-works-in-practice-in-theory-it-can-never-work/|"is that it only works in practice.

Now, the amount of time consensus takes is not, in my opinion, an issue in and of itself. I do believe that time allows for people to calm down, and creative solutions to be brought up. However, with consensus, there is no guarantee that any resolution at all will be affected, or than enough input is given to ensure that the resolution is lasting and has the support of a wide base of users. Combine that with the fact that if a person refuses to compromise, or take the view of other people into account consensus becomes unattainable, which becomes more and more likely the more people join into a discussion, and seeking consensus in such instances has as much effect as {{plain link|http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/bang+head+against+a+brick+wall|"banging your head against a brick wall"}}. But on this site, we have no other choice. If a discussion comes to no consensus, editors have no place to go. Therefore, the current system \'\'forces\'\' Wikipedia\'s community to bang their heads against a wall, running in infinite loops to solve a problem, where, more than like, the same group of editors that participated in previous discussions will bring their same viewpoints, and nothing ever gets done. Meanwhile, the problem that consensus was suppose to solve in the first place remains.

What I am proposing is a Regulation Committee, an elected group of sensible editors accountable to the community, who would have the ability to issue binding policy and guideline changes in an effort to solve problems brought before it by community members, and would only come into play when consensus has failed. The usefulness of such a committee will likely be evident to anyone who has ever been involved in a contentious discussion on this site. Editors fight bitterly from what ever point of view they have, and sometimes this prevent consensus from being built properly. We have already understood the sensibility of an [[WP:INVOLVED|uninvolved editor]] making decisions, and the potential destructiveness of involved and intransigent editors and administrators making binding or serious decisions that affect many people.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan="2" class="diff-empty diff-side-deleted"></td>\n  <td class="diff-marker" data-marker="+"></td>\n  <td class="diff-addedline diff-side-added"><br /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan="2" class="diff-empty diff-side-deleted"></td>\n  <td class="diff-marker" data-marker="+"></td>\n  <td class="diff-addedline diff-side-added"><div>Now, I do not question that consensus works in the vast majority of cases, and most editors are happy with it. But, when consensus doesn\'t work, it tends to not work spectacularly. An example, if you will: in August 2012, the community agreed that, "[[Wikipedia:Requests for Comment/Community de-adminship proof of concept|The current methods for removal of administrator rights are not sufficient and an additional community-driven method should be implemented.]]" Three goddamn years later, what have we accomplished? Stone wall, after stone wall, after stone wall. Consensus can be [[heaven]] (to paint a rosy picture) but it can also be an [[echo chamber]], a [[peanut gallery]], and a [[wiktionary:Battleground|battleground]]. Meanwhile, the problem that consensus was supposed to solve persists. And the &lt;s&gt;bitterly ironic&lt;/s&gt; funny thing is, we have no other avenue to go to but consensus, but we can\'t be sure that consensus will bring about anything substantive other than more bloviating and time-wasting. This is not something we should aspire to. It is in no one\'s interest if this community has been consensus\'d to absolute inaction and stagnation. Also, "no consensus" closures happen fairly often, but the only option is more consensus. When the same crop of editors bring the same opinions to another discussion, no consensus is reached. Cf. "banging your head against a brick wall." This is obviously frustrating, and it would benefit us to have an alternative to go to when consensus has failed.

Afterwards, there is a workshop phase that should normally last thirty days, but that time frame can be extended or abridged if a majority of the committee (50% and one) agree to do that. In the workshop, community members cast a cornucopia of proposals on how said problem could be fixed, and other community members discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each proposal. When the workshop phase is closed, regulators deliberate privately on the merits of each proposal and vote for the ones they think have the most merit, and the most probability to bring a long-lasting solution.{{#tag:ref|The difference between this and consensus is that, while consensus grants no assurances, we know that a binding decision will come out of this.

As noted in the some of the individual topic threads above by me and others, this is mean to be a long-term encyclopedia bio, not a blow-by-blow account of Corbyn\'s leadership bid or a daily news round-up service of who said what about it in the media. There\'s far too much detail on both his policy proposals and the reaction to both them and his bid as a whole, with people constantly adding more and more quotes from newspaper op-eds and other individual politicians (and mostly, as it happens, it\'s negative reaction being highlighted, which adds another layer to the problem). Even allowing for the fact that it\'s Corbyn\'s candidacy that has made this race what it is to some extent, just compare the sections on this in the other candidates\' pages: [[Andy Burnham]], [[Liz Kendall]] and [[Yvette Cooper]]. They, by contrast, could probably be expanded slightly – Cooper\'s didn\'t have one at all until I moved some stuff from here to it the other day – but they\'re much more in proportion. If it\'s not culled now, it will certainly have to be in a year or so\'s time, whether he wins or not. For a start, I\'d suggest people stop adding anything to it; and if it genuinely needs updating with more text, please trim something else to compensate. &lt;small&gt;\'\'\'[[User:N-HH|&lt;font color="navy"&gt;N-HH&lt;/font&gt;]]\'\'\' \'\'\'[[User talk:N-HH|&lt;font color="blue"&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/N-HH|&lt;font color="blue"&gt;edits&lt;/font&gt;]]\'\'\'&lt;/small&gt; 17:24, 28 August 2015 (UTC)}}</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class="diff-marker"></td>\n  <td class="diff-context diff-side-deleted"><div>{{RFC list footer|unsorted|hide_instructions={{{hide_instructions}}} }}</div></td>\n  <td class="diff-marker"></td>\n  <td class="diff-context diff-side-added"><div>{{RFC list footer|unsorted|hide_instructions={{{hide_instructions}}} }}</div></td>\n</tr>\n', 'page_title': 'Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Unsorted', 'year': 2015}

As the GA-rated article on Heathenry makes clear, "Heathenry" is the term which is commonly used (in particular by academics) as a catch-all to cover the entirety of this [[new religious movement]]. Other terms, such as "Asatru" and "Odinism", are favoured by some practitioners but are avoided by others, and lack the wider coverage of the term "Heathenry". Given that many of the Heathens in the United States do not use "Asatru" but instead favour "Odinism" or other terms, it seems problematic to have this page titled  "Ásatrú in the United States", with "Heathenry in the United States" being a much more inclusive and apposite title. I believe that this should be a fairly un-controversial change and would like to gain consensus in support of it from various otherwise un-involved editors.
