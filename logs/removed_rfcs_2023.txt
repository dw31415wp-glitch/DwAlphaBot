Proposing revision to non-Free image policy. Sometimes new software features will display relevant article images somewhere outside of the article, for example [[mw:Extension:Popups|ArticlePreview pop-ups]] and mobile [[mw:Extension:RelatedArticles|RelatedArticle links]]. Foundation staff are respecting [[WP:NFCP|non-Free content policy]], and each new feature can be configured to either include or exclude non-Free images as appropriate. Consensus [[WT:Non-free_content/Archive_65#Hovercards|approved non-Free images in ArticlePreviews]], as you are viewing a cropped version of the article itself with the image in educational context with related article text. On the other hand the RelatedArticle feature excludes non-free images. Policy calls out [[WP:Non-free_content#Multimedia|navigational use]] as unacceptable for non-Free images.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?go=Go&search=search+results%7E&title=Special%3ASearch&ns0=1 On-wiki search results] now include images, with non-free images currently excluded. Like Article Previews, search shows the image along with a cropped view of the article text. However search only shows about half as much text as Previews. For some portion of readers, the image + displayed article text in the search result may be a sufficient view of the article to fulfill their educational purpose for seeking that article, without needing to load the article page itself.

Propose to revise [[WP:Non-free content#Exemptions]]: "''Article images may appear <mark>within cropped article views in search results and</mark> article preview popups.''" [[User:Alsee|Alsee]] ([[User talk:Alsee|talk]]) 16:46, 4 December 2022 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I've been editing the articles relating to the Scythians over the course of several months, and since most editors tend to favour splitting pages after they reach a certain size, I split two further pages, [[Iškuza]] and [[Scythia]], covering the phases of Scythian history respectively in West Asia and in Europe, out of the [[Scythians|main page covering the Scythians]].

However, trying to split it has resulted into three articles, with both [[Iškuza]] and [[Scythia]] requiring large amounts of material regarding the role of the prior and subsequent histories of the Scythians in the creation and destruction of those states copied from each other and from the [[Scythians]] page to exist since they are both about immediately preceding/succeeding states created by the same continuous population group. And because Iškuza and Scythia both cover immediately preceding/succeeding but also partially overlapping parts of the history of the Scythians, multiple sections and sub-sections of each page covering the culture, population, external relations, etc of these states also had to be copied from the Scythians page (e.g. the "Background" sub-section and "Society" section in Scythia, and the "Origins," "Impact," and "Legacy" sections of Iškuza). Moreover, the [[Scythia]] page as it exists now also functions as a [[WP:Semi-duplicate]], given that most of the information relating to this polity also is also the same basic information that is required on the [[Scythians]] page.

Given this resulting situation, I have started a [[Talk:Scythians#Merger proposal|merger proposal]] to resolve this issue, per [[WP:MERGEREASON]]: '''Overlap''', '''Context''', not because I support a merger for the sake of merging itself, which I do not favour, but because Iškuza and Scythia require too much context and the information on these pages is too intertwined with each other.

The problem is that, despite months having passed, the discussion for the merger proposal is still at a deadlock due to the bad faith of one user who has consistently opposed the merger on the basis of verifiably untrue accusations while other opponents to the merger have refused to engage in further discussion even when the issues they had have since been addressed or corrected. Due to this, we have three users opposed to the merger, and three users (including myself) in favour of it, while the other supporters of the merger have been telling me to resort to [[WP:BOLD]] and implement the merger.

In this situation, I am bringing this issue to [[Wikipedia talk:Dispute resolution noticeboard#Deadlock on proposal to merge Iškuza and Scythia into_Scythians|Wikipedia's dispute resolution noticeboard]] and to W:RFC with the hope of being able to resolve this deadlock.

It seems bizarre that 20 years in we have no [[WP:MOS-Albania]] or [[MOS:Albania]], [[WP:Albania]] is just the wikiproject with no style guide, and there are 4 discussions of [[Albany, New York]], but none of [[Albania]] or its placenames in the archives here... but here we are. 

'''Every single Albanian placename has an indefinite''' (''any given'' Paris) '''and definite nominative form''' (''the specific'' Paris)'''. You might think ''all'' placenames are ''necessarily'' definite ''all the time'' but somehow they aren't''' and{{mdash}}this being the Balkans{{mdash}}somehow it's political. The subject has bizarrely never come up in the archive for [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Albania]]. [[Talk:Tirana#Tirana_or_Tiranë|This comment thread]] on [[Tirana]] (def. with Tiranë indef.) seems to be the only thorough discussion anywhere on the project... and it comes to no conclusions except to note that it seems like definite forms are more common for female Albanian names (=normal Latiny -a endings) versus indefinite forms being more common for male Albanian names (=leaving off the is and us and whatnot from the roots). There's also an accusation of racism and colonialism for preferring one of Albanian's own native grammatical structures... the correct one.

[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/936425/Albania_factfile.pdf This UK guide] notes that ''Communist'' Albania preferred definite names (since... y'know... they refer to a single specific place) and therefore ''free'' Albania has generally preferred to use indefinite names... (since... uh...) except in certain cases where it was just too weird. The [https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=AXkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PP12 old US gazetteers deferred to the Brits in the 1950s]; presumably they wouldn't now but aren't easily accessible via Google Books. The [https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/albania/map basic CIA info] seems to be random.

This leads to the exact same name for the exact same place being given in both forms: [[Himara]] for the Himara/Himarë District and [[Himarë (town)|Himarë]] for the Himara/Himarë Administrative Unit. No, agreement with the words for "district" and "unit" have nothing to do with the difference. It's ''exactly'' the same name, just presented inconsistently. Can we come to an agreement to always prefer the definite forms? Always prefer the indefinite forms except in truly egregious edge cases (Tirana isn't becoming Tiranë anytime soon)? or at least throw up a guide explaining what's going on here?&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User talk:LlywelynII|<span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em; class=texhtml">Llywelyn<span style="color: Gold;">II</span></span>]] 07:12, 10 December 2022 (UTC)}}

For the {{code|Infobox country}} template on articles for historical versions of geographic entities (dead countries, colonies, etc.), we include the preceding and succeeding entities, but we do not do this for modern countries/territories. I propose that this be implemented for modern countries/territories, as this would facilitate the link for readers between a country/territory's past iterations and its current state. Yes, I know we have "History of ___" articles for practically all countries/territories, but I think adding the entity/entities which directly precede(s) modern countries/territories into their infoboxes would significantly improve the ease with which people can navigate articles to learn about history. For example, for [[Ghana]]: adding <code>p1 = Dominion of Ghana</code> and <code>flag_p1 = Flag of Ghana.svg</code>. Should this be implemented?

Should the infobox for the political office "Führer and Reich Chancellor of the German People" as used in Nazi Germany be moved to the top (along with having the Nazism sidebar kept below it)?

I suggest the following options to proceed:

* '''Option 2''': Keep images, leave infobox where it is.
* '''Option 3''': Do not keep images, move the infobox to the top.

This article confusingly (see [[Talk:Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists#Current_status|above discussion]]) references more than one historical entity with the same or similar name.

* The original organization was founded in 1929
* In 1940 the OUN split into two factions:
** OUN-B led by Stepan Bandera, often associated with emigres
** OUN-M led by Andriy Melnyk
* From this point on it is unclear what organisation, if any, is referred to as OUN.

To preclude any misunderstanding, this page should become a disambiguation page that explains the above and links to relevant articles: [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (B)]], [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (M)]], etc.

I want to state that I am starting this section, not because I think the above is necessarily the best solution, but I think an involved discussion of several editors would be helpful to move this along.

Are the changes proposed in the above proof reasonable for the direct calculation section of the [[Monty Hall problem]] page?

Someone undid my changes because I accidentally typed "Monty Python problem" instead of Monty Hall problem. This was confirmed on [[user_talk:EEng|EEng's talk page]]. But when I reimplemented my changes correcting this typo, someone undid these changes thinking it was an edit war. I have done everything possible in order to show that this is just confusion rooted in a misunderstanding from that initial typo, as no one has actually issued any grievances with my proof (except [[user:MrOllie]], who simply said it was less preferable without responding to any of my points), but this has been to no avail. I just need someone to look at my proof and say whether it's good or bad so that I can finally reimplement my changes (assuming it's good). Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I have been overhauling the page for the [[Scythian religion]] for a while, and I have added new information drawn from reliable and significant academic sources to its section on the Scythian goddess Tabiti. Much of this information on Tabiti would however be better presented on a separate page for this deity, and it appears that the information added fits the criteria of [[WP:Notability]] for creating a new page for Tabiti.

However, the page for Tabiti was deleted due to sockpuppetry and the addition of fringe views and only administrators can now edit it.

I suggest this article needs to be retitled for better precision, less ambiguity and less confusion for our readers. Everyone agrees this article covers one aspect of a larger subject, specifically it's on the effort to push creationism into the public schools in Kentucky. Leaving this article titled as it is, with the [[Common name]] of the broad topic, implies it is a main article when this is actually a sub topic. That creates ambiguity and confusion. Per [[WP:Precision]], this article needs retitling to represent its actual scope. [[Intelligent design creationism]] or [[Intelligent design in Kansas]] or [[Kansas schools fight Intelligent design]] or [[Intelligent design and pseudoscience]] - anything that isn't simply "Intelligent design" by itself. For that we need a main article. [[User:Jenhawk777|Jenhawk777]] ([[User talk:Jenhawk777|talk]]) 05:18, 23 January 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Should the introductory sentence be "American deathcore band" or "American metal band"? Changing the lead genre to match the band's article no matter what genre is the album. The band itself is described as deathcore, not heavy metal. If we have to change it to heavy metal, we must do it on all pages, not just one page in particular. The biggest example, Bring Me the Horizon. Their only deathcore album is ''Count Your Blessings'' and just because of one album we have to change the introductory sentence to "British deathcore band" while the rest is "British rock band"? I don't think so. Even the most notable page, such as Metallica is consistent. Sure, the first four albums are thrash metal, but in the end they also play two different genres of metal. So in the end, instead of "American thrash metal band", they are written in all pages as "American heavy metal band". So they are two options to resolve this, either write Suicide Silence as "American deathcore band" or as "American heavy metal band". None of them are wrong. So can we agree that "American heavy metal band" will be in the introductory sentence in all the pages related to the band? Since they played more than just deathcore, then I guess heavy metal would be better for the lead. Lead genres should be broad. If not, "American deathcore band" should be in the introductory sentence. --[[User:Tobi999tomas|Tobi999tomas]] ([[User talk:Tobi999tomas|talk]]) 11:56, 1 January 2023 (UTC)}}

This is an article on the coat of arms of Lithuania, Belarus historically used a similar one (Pahonia, rejected by the Lukashenko regime in 1995), both symbols have the same history of being the coat of arms of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The section on Belarus should address this, and briefly describe the history of Pahonia's use in Belarus. 

At present, however, in my opinion, the section on Belarus is far from that. It unnecessarily repeats information about Belarus that can be found in the relevant articles, overelaborate compared to the rest of the article are the contents about the cooperation of some Belarusian activists with Lithuania in 1919 and the Belarusian military unit formed at its side in Grodno (the disarmament of this detachment by the Polish army is described in strange detail), as well as the 1995 referendum in which Belarusians rejected the Pahonia as the country's emblem. It is not difficult to fend off the impression that the article is written in a rather biased way and tries to convince us of something. First to the fact that Belarusians never had any statehood before 1918, that they owe their traditions to Lithuania, and that they never really wanted the Pahonia as an emblem, which they expressed in the 1995 referendum (a quick read of the [[1995 Belarusian referendum]] article shows that it was a bit more complicated than that).

In [[User:Marcelus/sandbox5|my sandbox]] I wrote an alternative proposal for this chapter. I tried to make it comprehensive, but also short.

As [[User:Cukrakalnis|Cukrakalnis]] rejects the changes I made and does not agree with my opinion, I request the comment from the community. I also ping [[User:GizzyCatBella|GizzyCatBella]] who participated in the discussion. [[User:Marcelus|Marcelus]] ([[User talk:Marcelus|talk]]) 18:53, 4 January 2023 (UTC)}}

The use of "''Widely described as''" in the second sentence is [[MOS:WEASEL|weasel words]]. Some other editors seem to disagree adamantly. Attempted to make changes citing sources to either replace weasel words or provide more factual context for the reader. My edits, intended to maintain [[Wikipedia:NPOV|NPOV]], were quickly reverted by other editors for what appears to be nitpicky reasons and potentially some ''[[argumentum ad populum]]'' concerning the disputed [[Wikipedia:NPOV|NPOV]]/[[MOS:WEASEL|WW]]. 

I'm concerned that their preconceptions about the social network (for example "Gab = bad" or "Alt tech = bad") is clouding their editorial judgment. It appears that most of the article — most alarmingly right in the first paragraph / lead section — presents heavy negative bias and criticism. In fact, I would say in the current state of the article, the controversy surrounding Gab is more emphasized than what Gab actually even is. I am concerned with "''how facts are selected, presented, or organized''" (Quote from: [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|NPOV (Neutral point of view)]] ).


Please help resolve this issue. 

See: [[Talk:Gab (social network)]] - Where I explained my reasoning in depth.

{{rfcquote|text=
This article about Gab is not written in an impartial tone. "Widely described as a haven" is not neutral phrasing. Widely described by whom? When you claim it is widely known that way, you need to say by whom, otherwise this is described as "[[Weasel_word|weasel words]]" according to [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]]. 

Wikipedia has policies about neutrality, nonjudgmental language, weasel words, impartial tone, etc. The rules of Wikipedia to remain neutral are ''just as important as the rule to use reliable sources while writing or editing Wikipedia articles. Not '''less''' important.'' Saying something is "widely described" on an controversial article, without saying who it is widely described by in-line, is not a neutral way of writing. 

I also want to address that the first paragraph of the article is heavily biased against Gab due to the way in which the facts are presented and organized, starting with heavy negative criticism from the cited sources filling the majority of the first paragraph. Most articles list critics and their criticism further down in the article under a subheading such as "Criticism and controversies", which seems to be the method of consensus across most of Wikipedia. It is fine to have some criticism and negative statements in the lede paragraph, but it should not be the primary focus. 

Please check the [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|NPOV (Neutral point of view) article]] that states "inappropriate tones can be introduced through how facts are selected, presented, or organized".

While this is self-evident to unbiased editors, I have also found sources that indicate that Gab being described as a "haven" is a statement from critics and not necessarily a widely-accepted fact: 

•  "Critics claim the site serves as a haven for extremist groups." - https://www.liferaftinc.com/blog/resources/gab-explained

•  "has been billed by some as the social network for the alt-right" - https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/gab-apple-twitter.html

Notice the terms used: "critics claim" and "has been billed by some as". This means there is not a near-complete consensus on the matter. 

Although I have only just heard about Gab for the first time within the last week and have never used it myself, I am amazed at how many unnecessary arguments have occurred on this talk page. NPOV is a policy of Wikipedia and it is counterproductive to argue against NPOV as it benefits all good-faith users and editors of Wikipedia. 

The irony of censoring NPOV edits on an article about a website that has been banned from most big tech platforms for allowing it's users mostly unrestricted freedom of speech is not lost on me. This type of behavior is why people create alternative websites in the first place. 

I humbly ask that another unbiased editor or administrator should reinstate my revision or make a similar revision to bring the article up to NPOV standards.

In [[Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis]], there is a dispute about using the [[Template:Efn]] for foreign-language names (Russian and Polish). I justify this move by pointing to articles where that is already the case: [[Joseph Stalin]] (Russian and Georgian names are in Efn), [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (French, Italian and Corsican names are in Efn), etc. Two users, @[[User:GizzyCatBella|GizzyCatBella]] and @[[User:Marcelus|Marcelus]], are against this and insist on removing the Efn. One of the users, Marcelus, accuses me of trying to "hide" Čiurlionis' Polish name ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMikalojus_Konstantinas_%C4%8Ciurlionis&diff=1132598968&oldid=1132591404]), while simultaneously removing the Russian name ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mikalojus_Konstantinas_%C4%8Ciurlionis&diff=1132435371&oldid=1132434471], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mikalojus_Konstantinas_%C4%8Ciurlionis&diff=1132440507&oldid=1132437142]).

Important to note that this list has been discussed on the talk page since 2007 (evident in [[Talk:List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes/Archive 1]]), meaning debates and discussions will never go away and have been ongoing for over a decade.

Ok, so for me, there's a lot not to like about the new layout.

But someone else can start that eventual RfC : )

I just want to focus on one very specific thing: the talk link being moved to a drop down.

Hiding the talk link is a very very bad idea.

We operate on the consensus model here.

Hiding the talk link just reinforces that edit-warring is the way to go.

And no, I really don't care what some off-site discussion was - so I don't need to hear an WMF employee breezily tell me that a talk page link was determined to not be important on Wikipedia. I'm happy to engage in discussion, but don't blow us off by referring elsewhere as if this project does not matter please. (As an aside, and this goes far beyond this simple RfC - But just thought I'd mention that while I respect the WMF in general - I think it's very important - but I'm really not happy about how things seem to be being pushed through, with fewer and fewer discussions being allowed to be "open" for anyone to participate.)

Anyway, if we weigh importance, I think it's easy to agree that the talk link is more important than the watchlist link. So if space ''really'' is the issue argued, then swap them. Or maybe combine "alerts" and "notices" to save space. Or whatever other ideas people may have.

Whatever the case, '''un-hide the talk link'''. - <b>[[User:Jc37|jc37]]</b> 19:30, 19 January 2023 (UTC)}}

ABA is a controversial practice. Going by polls, and statements made by a large number of representative organisations, it appears to be highly unpopular with its main target population, autistic people; on the other hand, it is backed up by research (also controversial) and forms a multi-billion-dollar industry supported by various governments. It is sometimes described as the 'gold standard in autism treatment'.

There is no alliance-based [[Parliamentary group]]s in the [[Lok Sabha]] and [[Rajya Sabha]]. Alliances are formed by political parties for general election, but they are not parliamentary groups (Legislatures in some countries like [[France]] follows the alliance-grouping system, but there is no such system followed in [[Lok Sabha]] and [[Rajya Sabha]]). In my opinion, adding alliances is unnecessary, because they're not official parliamentary groups and tends to be [[WP:SPECULATIVE]]. Also, this is one of the reasons for frequent edit war (adding and removing parties under an alliance). Here I'm seeking [[WP:CONSENSUS]] on whether adding alliances in the [[Lok Sabha]] and [[Rajya Sabha]] should be allowed or not. Thank you.

In several ways, especially it’s very dark color scheme, the current infobox photo (1981) is arguably one of the worst official presidential photographs we use here on the Wiki. I have proposed his 1985 presidential photograph as a replacement. This photo is more visually appealing, allows the reader to see more of the president's face, and is more encompassing to his presidency as whole since it was taken at the start of his second term. 

I am interested in hearing other's thoughts. [[User:7milestoHope|7milestoHope]] ([[User talk:7milestoHope|talk]]) 14:02, 14 February 2023 (UTC)}}

Me and a couple of other editors have inserted/re-inserted variations (in what is now the lead and in the 'box office' section) on the fact that Tár the movie, the subject of this article, had a very poor general public response to its release. The film was manifestly a great critical success. The juxtaposition is notable, but in any case the widely reported facts of both the poor general results and the public discussion of them are unarguable. There seems to me (I am not the most experienced editor and have no skin in this game but am simply trying improve the article) that the constant deletion of well-reported facts is rather odd. I do not accuse anyone at all of bad faith, certainly not, but I do wonder why obvious, notable and relevant facts keep being deleted. I have marked the matter RFC in order to learn from editors more experienced. I will not edit again for now as I do not wish to get involved in edit-warring.

There was a previous discussion and RFC similar to this held back in 2015 to early 2016<ref>{{cite web|title=Redundancy model|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Canada-related_articles/Archive_1#Redundancy_model|website=[[Wikipedia]]|access-date=January 21, 2023}}</ref>, however that was close to 6 years ago from when the discussions were held, so the views of editors may have changed since then, therefore I am requesting additional comments regarding the potential removal of the enforcement of the {{para|official_name}} parameter in the guidelines for handling city articles related to Canada. In my view, the requirement of this parameter to be included does not serve much of a purpose aside from creating unnecessary duplication in the infobox, and it is debatable as to whether this guideline meets [[WP:INFOBOXPURPOSE]] or not. The {{para|name}} and {{para|settlement_type}} parameters already fulfill what the {{para|official_name}} parameter intends to do. I understand the parameter exists to perhaps indicate the corporate entity under which a given city or town is managed, but this information probably is not that important to most readers and in my view, contributes to a bloating of the infobox. I would argue this extends to U.S. city articles as well. 

'''TL;DR:''' Should the mandatory requirement of using the {{para|official_name}} parameter be dropped due to implication of official name by both {{para|name}} and {{para|settlement_type}} parameters? - [[User:Evelyn Marie|Evelyn Marie]] ([[User_talk:Evelyn Marie|leave a message]] · [[Special:Contributions/Evelyn Marie|contributions]]) 00:37, 22 January 2023 (UTC)}}

Hello. I see several issues with other user's edits. Please, see history of the article. First of all, names of characters and actors in Japanese (the movie's original language) were added, moreover using «Character: Actor» formula instead of «Actor as Character». An unnecessary link to the prequel series' characters list was also added to the plot section. I tried resolving the issues, at first explaining my reverts during the changes and then contacting the user, but it led nowhere. Also, another anonymous user moves the cast section under «Production» and «Release», which I don't think is right. Please, help in resolving these issues. Thanks.

Please comment on the proposed merger of [[Az-Zakariyya]] into this article. The following excellent research paper provides useful context: <small>{{cite journal | last=Tsahor | first=Dan | title=Postwar Nakba: A Microhistory of the Depopulation of Zakariyya, 1950 | journal=Journal of Palestine Studies | publisher=Taylor & Francis, Ltd. | volume=49 | issue=1 (193) | year=2019 | issn=0377919X | jstor=26873258 | pages=47–63 | url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26873258 | quote=But unlike other, similar settlements that were built over the ruins of erased Palestinian localities, Moshav Zekharia seems to have maintained the original layout of the former Palestinian village. While most post-1948 Jewish settlements were constructed on land leveled by bulldozers, the residential buildings of Moshav Zekharia stand on uneven terrain. The settlement’s roads follow paths that had earlier served the residents of Zakariyya, and some of the old limestone houses, and even the village mosque, remain standing in the center of the moshav, surrounded by hazard signs that warn passersby of a possible collapse... On 17 May 1950, the military transferred fifteen families, comprising 65 people, to the town of Ramla, while the rest of the community, some 130 people, were taken to a location near the Jordanian border. On the day of the eviction, soldiers went to every house in the village calling all residents to gather in the center of Zakariyya... To hasten the process, soldiers shot in the air several times... The “evacuation” of Zakariyya was a historic turning point, not only for the evacuees but also in terms of the material landscape they left behind. Two weeks after the village was emptied, the Jewish Agency brought in families of Jewish-Kurdish veterans from the Iraqi army. The new residents first settled in a tent encampment near the village school before moving into eighty new stone-built houses inside the boundaries of the former Palestinian village and among its remaining old buildings.|ref=none}}</small>

Note there was historical consensus against a merge at [[talk:Az-Zakariyya#Merge]]. I '''support''' a merge, as there is historical continuity in location and layout, despite the wholesale replacement of the population.

{{rfcquote|text=
I would like to preface this stating that I am not at all knowledgeable in this area.

I participated in the RfC on this page a while back and I think we failed to provide a clearer lead. This was part of the lead at the time of the RfC:

{{tq2|In thermodynamics, heat is energy in transfer to or from a thermodynamic system, by mechanisms other than thermodynamic work or transfer of matter (e.g. conduction, radiation, and friction). Like thermodynamic work, heat transfer involves the surroundings of a system, as well as the system itself, and so is not a property of the system alone, though it contributes to change in the system's internal energy, which is a property of the system alone. This is distinct from the ordinary language usage of the word 'heat' as a property of a system in itself.}}

Currently, the first two paragraphs of the lead look like this:

{{tq2|In thermodynamics, heat is defined as the form of energy crossing the boundary of a thermodynamic system by virtue of a temperature difference across the boundary. A thermodynamic system does not contain heat. Nevertheless, the term is also often used to refer to the thermal energy contained in a system as a component of its internal energy and that is reflected in the temperature of the system. For both uses of the term, heat is a form of energy. An example of formal vs. informal usage may be obtained from the right-hand photo, in which the metal bar is "conducting heat" from its hot end to its cold end, but if the metal bar is considered a thermodynamic system, then the energy flowing within the metal bar is called internal energy, not heat. The hot metal bar is also transferring heat to its surroundings, a correct statement for both the strict and loose meanings of heat. Another example of informal usage is the term heat content, used despite the fact that physics defines heat as energy transfer. More accurately, it is thermal energy that is contained in the system or body, as it is stored in the microscopic degrees of freedom of the modes of vibration.}}

After reading these, should the lead be rewritten, should we revert back to the old lead, or keep it as is?

As pointed out in an earlier discussion and in the link below, the person under the former name was Director of Pediatric Ambulatory Services and the Director of Adolescent Medicine at Penn State University, which seems significant enough to be considered notable.

Consolidating [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Film/Indian cinema task force#Removal of music composers from infobox|this discussion]] on one page with this rfc.

To summarise the matter briefly, we want to hear what the community has to say about the inclusion of song composers in the infobox for a musical film, particularly in Indian cinema, in which songs are ''the'' integral part of a film's music score. For example, for a musical film such as ''[[The Greatest Showman]]'', the "music by" parameter should include both [[Benj Pasek]] and [[Justin Paul]] (who composed the songs) and [[John Debney]] and [[Joseph Trapanese]] (who composed the background score). The current wording of including only "film score" is ambiguous at best, and makes no mention of musical films.

Cheers to everyone here ! If you want a broader response, leave a note on the relevant noticeboards. 
The main issue is obviously with the sourcing, among all the cited sources, is any of these are from [[WP:HISTRS|historians]] ? see - [[WP:HSC]]. 
I never came across a reliable source from a decent scholar which cites chronicler [[Hasan Nizami]] and states explicitly that Muhammad was asssasined by the Khokhars (will cite a source later) - most main stream scholars who wrote about his assassination only statez that assassins were either Khokhars - but didn't press upon the identity of those assassins.  <u>Habib 1981</u> (will cite later) added details and explained why writings of Ferishta which were written 500 years after Muhammad's assassination don't hold much water. 

I earlier added that it's possible that Muhammad was assassinated jointly by Khokhars and Ismailis - [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MobileDiff/1116356653 Diff/1116356653], but it qas removed for some absurd reasons but of late my contribution towards the enclyopedia are not in same frequency as they used to be. 

To cut a long story short, you yourself apparently <u> conceded that this is not the mainstream consensus among scholars </u> We don't promote [[WP:Fringe|fringe]] theories.

Habib 1981 (cited in article) [https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.12735/page/n168/mode/1up see here as well]
{{talk quote|It is generally thought that Shihabuddin was assassinated by the Khokhars and a detail account of how they accomplished their purpose is given by Ferishta. Twenty Khokhar infidels he says whose sons and relations had fallen in the battle against the Sultan vowed revenge even at cost of their own lives...detail account of Ferishta writting...

These are circumstantional details of later day story, Minhajus siraj juzjani who was fifteen aur sixteen year old at the time of sultan's death merely states that he was assassined by a heretic devotee (fida-i-mulhadia). I see no reason for distrusting Minhajus Siraj's contemporary account. He bore no love for the heretics and had no motive for misrepresenting a fact which everybody was aware}}

Four years ago there was an RfC surrounding what national identifier to use in association with this company in its lede sentence. Recently, there seems to be a consensus that the language arrived at in that RfC is not great. This new RfC is an attempt to see if we can come to conensus on new, clearer language.

Here are possible options for what national identiefier to use to describe this company in the lede sentence.

*'''Option A''' - Status quo. Maintain the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rocket_Lab&diff=893816970&oldid=893815116 last RfC's indicated language] (i.e. "American aerospace manufacturer ... New Zealand subidiary")
*'''Option B''' - Describe as an "American" company
*'''Option C''' - Describe as a "New Zealand" company
*'''Option D''' - Describe as an "American-New Zealand" or "US-New Zealand" company
*'''Option E''' - Describe as "founded in New Zealand and headquarted in the US"
*'''Option F''' - Don't use a national identifier in the lead sentence. Explain national identity further on in the lead.
*'''Option G''' - Describe as a "multinational" company

From the beginning of the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], when the Russian troops occupied some Ukrainian territory, some users started to add the information on the occupation (in variuos ways) in the infobox. Other users remove this information. I have some of these localities on my watchlist, and these additions and removals are way too frequent. See just recently and just for [[Kreminna]] which is just one locality: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kreminna&diff=prev&oldid=1137013769&diffmode=source one] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kreminna&diff=prev&oldid=1137201268&diffmode=source two] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kreminna&diff=prev&oldid=1137201268&diffmode=source three] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kreminna&diff=prev&oldid=1138059304&diffmode=source four]. This bullshit needs to stop. I do not particularly care which way it would stop but we need a clear consensus that either mentioning or not mentioning occupation in infobox is ok, and the opposite is not ok.

In principle, this RfC should apply to any ongoing to conflict, but my primary interest is Ukraine. I would also exclude [[Crimea]] because it is really administrated by Russia, and the arguments could be slighly different, we can return to it another time. This is really about clear-cut cases.

A [[Talk:List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes/Discussion|series of ongoing discussions since July 2022]] have been working to fix and organize the [[List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes]]’s section for [[List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes#Possible F5/EF5/T10+ tornadoes officially rated F4/EF4/T9 or lower|Possible F5/EF5/T10+ tornadoes officially rated F4/EF4/T9 or lower]]. One specific source, [https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/techrpts/tr9902/tr9902.pdf  ''1998-1999 Tornadoes and a Long-Term U.S. Tornado Climatology'' by the National Climate Data Center] is used for multiple tornadoes on the list. Which option is best? [[Talk:List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes#Further information|Further information below the options]].

#Source is outdated, meaning any tornado on the list solely with that reference for a possible F5 rating should be removed.
#Source is fine to use for possible F5 ratings for the list.
#Other (Specify in discussion)

I came here to learn about bird blood. (Turning elsewhere, apparently not all of their bones are hollow.)
Unfortunately, everything here seems human-specific, or if it isn't, it's mixed in enough to not be easily distinguished.
I think this page should either be renamed ''Human Hematopoiesis'', and the same thing done for the Hematopoietic System page and anything else with the same problem, or it should be rewritten to account for other animals.
In either case, I think it's a lot of work and also a big decision, so I'm opening a Request for Comment.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should [[WP:USPLACE]] (specifically regarding major cities) be based on the ''[[AP Stylebook]]''?

[[WP:USPLACE]] cites the AP Stylebook for the "comma convention" ({{xt|"Placename, State"}}) for populated places in the USA, only excluding [[Atlanta]], [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Cleveland]], [[Dallas]], [[Denver]], [[Detroit]], [[Honolulu]], [[Houston]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Miami]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Minneapolis]], [[New Orleans]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Oklahoma City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[St. Louis]], [[Salt Lake City]], [[San Antonio]], [[San Diego]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]. 

Many large cities such as the following would usually use the short form name per [[WP:PRITOP]], [[WP:COMMONNAME]], [[WP:CONCISE]], [[WP:CONSISTENT]] and [[WP:PRECISE]].
*[[Louisville, Kentucky]]
*[[Nashville, Tennessee]]
*[[Sacramento, California]]
*[[Jacksonville, Florida]]
*[[Orlando, Florida]]
*[[Austin, Texas]]
*[[Fort Worth, Texas]]
*[[Charlotte, North Carolina]]
*[[El Paso, Texas]]
*[[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]
*[[Fresno, California]]
*[[Tucson, Arizona]]
*[[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]
*[[Omaha, Nebraska]]
*[[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]
*[[Raleigh, North Carolina]]
*[[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]
*[[Oakland, California]]
*[[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]
*[[Bakersfield, California]]
*[[Topeka, Kansas]]
*[[Tampa, Florida]]
*[[Anaheim, California]]
*[[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]


Some clearly fulfil [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]], and in many cases are redirected from the short form (for example [[Orlando]] redirects to [[Orlando, Florida]]), but cannot have the title be solely the city name.<br/>

'''Nere's a quick mock-up of what I'd like it to look like.'''<br/>

Where populated places in the [[United States]] qualify for [[Wikipedia:Primary topic]], the title of the article should be the name of the place. Where articles on populated places require disambiguation, the '''comma convention''' should be used (typically titled {{xt|"Placename, State"}}) when located within a state (or {{xt|"Placename, Territory"}} in US territories).  A placename that needs additional disambiguation should include its [[County (United States)|county]] or [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]] (e.g., [[Elgin, Lancaster County, South Carolina]], and [[Elgin, Kershaw County, South Carolina]]). If more than one place ''within the same county'' has the same name, specify the type of local government unit in parentheses before the comma, for any article that is not the [[WP:Disambiguation#Primary topic|primary topic]] (e.g., [[Callicoon (CDP), New York]], and [[Callicoon (town), New York]], but not "Callicoon, New York (CDP)"). A small number of [[unincorporated area|unincorporated communities]] bear two states' names due to their peculiar locations across state lines (e.g., [[Glenrio, New Mexico and Texas]]).

Articles on US cities should ''never'' be titled {{xt|"City, Country"}} (e.g., "Detroit, United States") or {{xt|"City, State, Country"}} (e.g., "Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.") because that is contrary to general American usage. Postal abbreviations (such as ''CA'' or ''Calif.'' for California) are never used in article titles. (For postal abbreviations in articles, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Abbreviations#Special considerations}}).

 How should pregnant mummy discovery paragraph be presented in the article?

As can be read from the above discussion, pregnant mummy discovery seems to be a controversial topic: there are scientists and sources supporting it, as well as those who criticise it.

Question arises: whether the biographic page of ms. Szilke should mention the pregnant mummy discovery as a fact, or not? Should we mention the critical standpoint of the discovery and to what extent? [[User:XEillisx|XEillisx]] ([[User talk:XEillisx|talk]]) 15:33, 8 March 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
It has been brought to our attention that our infoboxes do not follow the standard practices of Wikipedia and thus a replacement has been devised that addresses the concerns raised. The current infoboxes lack padding and have multiple colored bars at the top, which is inconsistent with how other infoboxes are displayed. Another issue is that our infoboxes involve a complex coding array that makes it difficult to edit and add new features. Some features within these infoboxes are outdated and should be replaced by newer ones. Additionally, we had to remove links to scales within the colored bars on the tropical cyclone infobox because they violated [[WP:ACCESS]] due to lack of contrast with the background; the lack of a link to the scales is a disservice to our readers. The proposed infobox, [[Template:Infobox weather event]], includes the addition of padding, has the colored bars (Category of a storm/event) with their respective data (consistency with other infoboxes), contains new features and some existing ones have been updated, and is much easier to edit since it's modular (each scale has its own subtemplate) rather than several different scales and events lumped into one template with if statements. Please see that template for its usage and display. Please see [[Template:Infobox storm]], [[Template:Infobox tropical cyclone]], and [[Template:Infobox flood]] for their displays and usages.

{{rfcquote|text=
Currently, [[WP:UDP]] says:{{talk quote|Requests for undeletion should be used to appeal most instances of proposed deletion and some speedy deletions.}}
However, there is some debate due to the vagueness of what {{tq|some}} speedy deletions actually includes. Currently, [[WP:REFUND]] says: 
{{talk quote|Please do not request that pages deleted under speedy deletion criteria [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#F7|F7]], [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#F9|F9]], [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#F11|F11]], [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#U5|U5]], [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#A7|A7]], [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#A9|A9]], [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#A11|A11]], [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G3|G3]], [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G4|G4]], [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G10|G10]], [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G11|G11]] or [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G12|G12]] be undeleted here.}}

However, as [[User:Uanfala|Uanfala]] has mentioned on the [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for undeletion#Which CSD shouldn't get refunded here?|talk]], this provision was boldly added by a now-banned user, and the archives are fairly divided to find any hard consensus.

Notably, G5 is not currently listed, but several admins have echoed that they refuse to restore material by banned or blocked editors per [[WP:BMB]] as a means to enforce bans and dissuade the user from returning. However, other editors advocate that [[WP:BANREVERT]] states there is no hard rule to delete potentially useful content, although you are allowed to. This means there is no settled precedent for either supporting and opposing such requests, and it is entirely up to the reviewing administrator to refuse such a request purely based on their outlook of how material added by banned users should be treated. Thus, I think a centralized discussion regarding this would be the best idea going forward.

So as a repeat from the top, can good faith editors appeal to move deleted material from a CSD to a draft or their userspace to work on? (This assumes that there are no other issues with the pages and, in the case of G5, the requesting editor is not affiliated with the banned page creator unless they satisfy [[WP:PROXYING]]). And if so, do administrators use their personal best judgment or concede (in most cases) to allow for community-consensus discussion such as [[WP:AFD]] and [[WP:DRV]]? [[User:Why? I Ask|Why?

Strictly according to [[WP:G13]], the deletion criterion applies to pages that have not been '''edited by a human''' in six months. This does not explicitly exclude sockpuppets of blocked or banned humans doing so in contravention of their block/ban. What is the official position here? If the intention is that such edits should not reset the clock, should this be made explicitly clear?

Apologies if this has been asked - I could not find this specific issue in the archive.

In the deletion discussion, the general agreement of other Wikipedia editors is that the [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Chris_Bart| disciplinary decision should be referenced]], and a reliable source has been cited. Rather than provoke an edit war against anonymous sympathisers (or Prof. Bart himself), I'd like direction on:

# whether the reference should be included; and
# how to prevent anonymous users from repeatedly deleting the reference.

I do not know whether suppression constitutes [[WP:Vandalism]], and it doesn't fall into the libel category that would qualify for assistance on the [[WP:BLPN]]. On the contrary, it's trying to suppress unflattering information about Prof. Bart.

[[User:Cat's Tuxedo]] and I have a disagreement on whether it is appropriate to include the fascism template at the bottom of the article. My argument is that, since there are multiple sources in the article that indicate that many experts consider Trumpism to be a form of fascism, and the article indicates as such, it should be included. Their argument is that the sources are all invalid because they do not cite [[Giovanni Gentile]] specifically or make comparisons to his works. According to them, quote, "''If a "expert" does not cite Gentile in assigning the "fascist" label to something, then the designation means nothing''". 

So I would like to ask, should the template stay or go? Please reply with '''keep template''' to indicate that the template should stay, or '''remove template''' to indicate that it should not. [[User:Di (they-them)|Di (they-them)]] ([[User talk:Di (they-them)|talk]]) 03:05, 3 March 2023 (UTC)}}

To bring [[WP:POSTNOM]] in better agreement with [[MOS:BIOFIRSTSENTENCE]], I propose that this policy be altered to specifically omit [[post-nominal letters]] from lead sentences.

Per our [[MOS:FIRSTBIO|guideline on biographical opening paragraphs]], "{{green|''the opening paragraph of a biographical article should neutrally describe the person, provide context, establish notability and explain why the person is notable, and reflect the balance of reliable sources.''}}" Post-nominal letters, many of which are unknown to laypeople, do not do any of those things. If anything, they actually delay a reader from getting to the part of the opening sentence that describes a person's notability.

Instead, WP:POSTNOM would advise that post-nominals be placed in the body of the article. If needed, the exact wording of this revised section will be determined after this RfC concludes.

Hello, everyone, I am proposing that we expand the scope of WikiProject Television to create several task forces for streaming services like that of Netflix, Amazon, Apple Plus, HBO, and Hulu. These are the ones off the top of my head that I think that is useful since there are hundreds or nearly thousands of articles related to these services about the programming alone. Netflix should be a given considering we have several Netflix navboxes for the exact purpose of linking shows among other articles which have gotten extreme large just to link them all together. And the fact of scope for Netflix is probably the largest of the services put together.

We should be in contact with the Film project since these companies also produce films, not just TV shows. But we have more articles for television shows than films. And the task forces should have the parameters with the project banners and have the ability to list the importance of the articles from top to low for these services. As of right now, there are only five task forces for networks, BBC, Cartoon Network, ITC Productions, and Nickelodeon. Although, both ITC and Nick are tagged as inactive. Disney doesn't need one since there is already a Disney WikiProject that covers the streaming-related articles for them.

Regarding naming, it should be simple such as the following:
* '''Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/Netflix task force'''
* '''Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/Amazon task force'''
* '''Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/Apple Plus task force'''
* '''Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/HBO task force'''
* '''Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/Hulu task force'''

Look to seeing everyone's thoughts and ideas on this. [[User:WikiCleanerMan|WikiCleanerMan]] ([[User talk:WikiCleanerMan|talk]]) 23:41, 5 March 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Taking into account the recent changes that have been made in this article, and that the awards-related statement has been removed from the end of the first paragraph of this article; I think it is necessary to implement a new statement in the lead section of the article in order to cover the information according to the new situation.

Therefore, I consider that the appropriate location to add such a statement is the middle part of the fourth paragraph of the article, before the sentence "''His honors include 15 [[Grammy Awards]]...''".

Keeping in mind some suggestions previously expressed in this Talk page by users such as BD2412 and Apoxyomenus, and aiming for greater neutrality and accuracy for the article, I ask for your opinion:

What statement do you consider should be added to cover the awards-related information within the new situation?
*'''A''' "According to some estimates, Jackson is claimed as the most awarded recording artist in pop music history"
*'''B''' "Some sources have deemed Jackson the most awarded musician in history"
*'''C''' "By some measures, Jackson was the most awarded musician in history"
*'''D''' "According to some sources, Jackson is considered the most awarded recording artist in history"
*'''X''' "Jackson is one of the most awarded music artists"
<small>The following options are statements that would be placed before the sentence "''Jackson's inductions include the [[List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees|Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]...''" in the fourth paragraph of the lead section.</small>
*'''Z''' "By some estimations, he was the most awarded music artist in history"
*'''E''' "By some estimations, he is the most awarded music artist in history"
Finally, if anyone wishes to propose a different statement, suggestions are completely welcome.

Nearly every country has a range of classifications used for their languages: "official language", "national language", "regional language", etc... When a country only has one language though, the default parameter "Official languages" must be used according to the "languages_type" docs. This poses several issues: one being that it is grammatically incorrect to have "Official languages" refer to one language. It should be "Official language" instead. Another issue is that it creates unnecessary edit wars for one side trying to correct the grammar and the other side trying to stick to the infobox parameter docs.

I propose that a new parameter of "language_type" be created to ensure the grammar is correct for the label  when referring to only one language. It should allow the label "Official language" to be used instead of "Official languages" when there is only one language stated.

{{rfcquote|text=
At least as far as I've noticed, when including a place of birth in an article's infobox, it's the general practice on Wikipedia to use historical place names. Sometimes the modern-day country is included, as with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] or [[Mila Kunis]]. With [[Kaja Kallas]] being featured on the main page, it came to my attention that many articles for people born in what's now [[Estonia]] (and possibly other states) do not adhere to this practice. It appears that, due to Estonia having been on the receiving end of [[Russian imperialism]] for the last few hundred years and the idea of [[state continuity of the Baltic states]], opinions on whether to list Estonia or [[Estonian SSR]] as someone's place of birth often reflect the politics of the editors involved.

Personally, I think the de facto recognition of the Soviet administration by most paired with other factors like the [[monopoly on the legal use of force]] make linking to the SSR articles the sensible thing to do. Additionally, I believe the articles on the Baltic SSRs do a sufficiently good job of addressing questions about their legitimacy. In any case, I think it would be helpful to solicit comments and see if we can maybe get some kind of consensus here.

Should the United States article continue to mention the country's practice of the death penalty vs. countries such as [[Japan]] and [[Taiwan]]? 

This has been a simmering topic over the past year. Arguments and discussion surrounding it [[Talk:United_States/Archive_103#Death_penalty_in_the_lead|can be seen here]]. 

As a quick synopsis of the pro-"removal" view: 

* Other countries with similar/higher ''per capita'' execution rates — including [[Japan]] and [[Taiwan]] — have articles that intentionally exclude mention. Per me: {{tqi|If we're going to apply this standard to the United States, we're going to have to imply it to other developed nations such as Japan, Singapore, or Taiwan. This "standard" is utterly inconsistent and contradictory otherwise.}}
* Editors personal dislike of the continued usage of the death penalty doesn't mean that it's notable enough to mention in the article. '''A majority of the world's population lives in a polity that retains it.''' Per me: {{tqi|Draws WP: Undue attention to the issue. Even within the developed world: Israel, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, amid others, routinely (frequently greater than the current per capita incidence in the United States) apply the death penalty for various routine crimes; additionally, Peru, Brazil, Chile, and a few other developed countries at least partially retain it in exceptional circumstances. (Albeit far less frequently) Taking an even broader perspective, 60% of the global population lives in a country in which the death penalty is applied. I'm failing to see (even within the Western-aligned world) how this is nothing more than WP: Undue. The only reason it seems to be mentioned in the lead is because of WP:JUSTDONTLIKEIT and to give the article a sense of "pro" and "con" balance.}} 

As a quick synopsis of the anti-"removal" view:

* [[Talk:United_States/Archive_103#Death_penalty_in_the_lead|Per Moxy]]: {{tqi|United States remains the only advanced democracy that fails to recognize capital punishment as a profound human rights violation and as a frightening abuse of government power....things like this are beyond the pale.}}
* [[Talk:United_States/Archive_103#Death_penalty_in_the_lead|Per Moxy]]: {{tqi|In the eyes of the Western World this is a human rights violation beyond measure and is lead worthy without a doubt. This is the main human rights situation in the USA. Crazy they have legal killing in this day and age....view of the world. .... UN request. ....that happens for ever president.}} 
* Per [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AUnited_States&type=revision&diff=1101158973&oldid=1101138465 Mason Jones]: {{tqi|[It] note[s] that the U.S. holds itself out to the world as a model of liberty and human rights; its government freely criticizes other nations. The current text simply says that the U.S. fails to reach its potential for such a wealthy (and ''critical'') democracy.}}

A detailed examination of the arguments for and against - which I suggest editors read - can be found [[Talk:United_States/Archive_101#Removing_some_of_the_criticism_in_lead?|here]] and [[Talk:United States/Archive 103|here]].

According to the Wikipedia article [[Mass shootings in the United States]]: {{tq|Mass shootings are incidents involving multiple victims of firearm-related violence. Definitions vary, with no single, broadly accepted definition.}} And, to the extent, this definition controls the category, this article gives a fairly "clear indication" it belongs. However, [[User:Freedom4U]] has argued that that logic is [[WP:SYNTH|an improper synthesis]]. And, critically, we have not discovered any sources directly calling the Goetz shooting a "mass shooting." 

The question: '''Should this article, concerning firearm-related violence and multiple persons injured, be included in the mass-shooting category, even though no sources directly refer to it as a mass shooting?'''--[[User:Jerome Frank Disciple|Jerome Frank Disciple]] ([[User talk:Jerome Frank Disciple|talk]]) 15:23, 10 April 2023 (UTC)}}

I would like to seek consensus about whether or not decimal places should be used in the percentages in the star count table. [[User:WWGB|WWGB]] stated that decimal places shouldn't be used in the percentages of the star count table, reverting me three times ''(violating [[WP:3RR]]''), believing them to be "unnecessary" because they believe using the decimal places is [[false precision]].

However, I believe it is necessary and accurate to include decimal places, because it is still precise to include some decimal places as the stars aren't always awarded in whole numbers of stars (some trials award thirds or halves of stars to contestants) and by the end of the series, celebrities accumulate a large number of stars, in which decimal places are important in distinguishing different celebrity star count accuracy rates (winning 48.5% of stars is not the same as winning 49.49% of stars).

This template [[Template:Infobox Indian state or territory]] was created to replace the [[Template:Infobox settlement]] in all the articles of [[:Category:States and union territories of India]]. 
An editor [[User:Tojoroy20|Tojoroy20]] doesn't want the existence of the parameters "image_skyline", "imagesize", "image_alt" and "image_caption" in this template. Tojoroy assumes that those parameters aren't useful enough. On the other hand, [[User:Haoreima|Haoreima]] wants the existence of these parameters. According to Haoreima, before the creation of this particular template, all the articles on [[:Category:States and union territories of India]], used the [[Template:Infobox settlement]],  and all those articles utilize those particular parameters (whose existence is currently in conflict between these 2 editors), thereby considering it is logically reasonable to put them in the new template (this template) also, which is going to serve all those very articles.

The general question is sparked from the controversy around [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2023-03-09/Recent research|this Signpost article]], much of which can be seen at [[Wikipedia talk:Wikipedia Signpost/2023-03-09/Recent research|its talk page]]. In particular, see the WP:ANI thread [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive1122#Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2023-03-09/Recent_research|here]], which was opened on the basis that the article {{tq|"prejudges an active Arbitration case"}}, suggested that the review prior to publication was {{tq|"the most ever for any Signpost piece"}} and was left up roughly on the basis that {{tq|"it is one editor's opinion. Not the voice of the SignPost"}}. 

So in an attempt to avoid similar chaos next time this happens, please provide your view on whether Signpost articles on open ArbCom cases should be written in an NPOV manner, or whether a one-sided opinion piece is fine. Ideally without commenting on the specifics of this one current ArbCom case.

There has been disagreement between editors on multiple occasions whether or not the following situation is [[WP:OR|original research]] (not allowed) or if it falls under [[WP:CALC|basic and routine calculations]]:

Most tornadoes in the United States are given a damage total provided by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). Based on the those damage totals, a list of the top ten costliest tornadoes of that year is created. An example would be [[Tornadoes of 2022#Costliest United States tornadoes]]. NOAA does not provide a straight list of the costliest tornadoes of the year. This means there is no explicit source saying what the top ten costliest tornadoes of the year are as it was derived from the provided damage totals. Are Wikipedia articles allowed to say X tornado was the (1st/2nd/3rd ect..) costliest tornado of the year under a basic and routine calculation (looking at which numbers are larger than other numbers) or does it fall under [[WP:OR|original research]] as no source explicitly states the list?

*'''Option 1''': It falls under [[WP:CALC]] as a basic and routine calculation.

Concern has been raised over the length and level of detail within individual tornado summaries. With direct access to the [https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/StormDamage/DamageViewer/ National Weather Service's Damage Assessment Toolkit], editors are able to obtain information on tornado impacts down to the street level. This also means the summaries are heavily reliant on a single source. We're mainly looking for guidance on how to best adhere to [[WP:MOS]] and [[WP:NOTEVERYTHING]] regarding what information is not insignificant and how detailed these prose summaries should be. The primary section prompting this discussion is [[Tornado outbreak of March 24–27, 2023#Rolling Fork–Midnight–Silver City, Mississippi]] but this same concern extends to many other tornado articles (including but not limited to [[2011 Joplin tornado]], [[2021 Western Kentucky tornado]], and [[Tornado outbreak of December 10–11, 2021]]). ~ [[User:Cyclonebiskit|Cyclonebiskit]] ([[User talk:Cyclonebiskit|chat]]) 05:44, 29 March 2023 (UTC)}}

Should the lede sentence of [[Man]], ''"A man is an adult male human",'' include a footnote saying that male may refer to sex or gender? 

As it is now, some readers may read "male" as sex, and others may read "male" as gender, which may result in confusion. So, some options are:

* '''A''' - Keep it as it is: "A man is an [[adult]] [[male]] [[human]]."
* '''B''' - Add a footnote saying "''Male'' may refer to sex or gender."
* '''C''' - Add a footnote saying "''Male'' in this case meaning belonging to the sex which typically produces sperm, or to the gender which is typically associated with it." (using the [[wikt:male#English|wiktionary definition]])
* '''Other''' - suggest another idea if you think something else could work.

We can of course add references to the statement, like from Merriam Webster, OED, and Cambridge English Dictionary if needed. [[User:Born25121642|Born25121642]] ([[User talk:Born25121642|talk]]) 22:20, 26 March 2023 (UTC)}}

There's been a debate about how to describe recent controversial remarks about race from cartoonist Scott Adams. The debate centers around whether his comments should be described as "racist" in a narrative/Wikipedia voice, or whether the adjective should be attributed.

Should the desription in lead read as either;

<u>Option A</u> : "...after Adams published a video which included ''racist comments about Black people.''"

'''or'''

<u>Option B</u> : "...after Adams published a video which included ''comments about Black people that were widely characterized as racist.''"

'''or'''

<u>ALT1</u> <small>(as proposed by [[User:DFlhb|DFlhb]])</small> "...after ''he characterized Black Americans as a "hate group"''"

'''or'''

<u>ALT2</u> <small>(as proposed by [[User:Rhododendrites|Rhododendrites]])</small> "...after ''he characterized Black Americans as a "hate group" and said that white people should "get the hell away from Black people"''"

Is the use of the label "fraudster" for Holmes appropriate, in the lead or otherwise?  There is guidance on [[MOS:LABEL]] and [[WP:BLPSTYLE]] on the use of labels applied to people in biographies, but they appear to me to be not definitive in the present case.  It's clear the use of labels is an issue of concern for Wikipedia, and a biography of a living person demands special care.  Further, the issue extends beyond the present article to others, e.g., [[Sunny Balwani]] and likely many other articles (and perhaps similar labels).  It's also clear that sometimes, though a label for a person is formally correct, it is not employed for an article, out of decorum or other reasons.  Use of the "fraudster" label in reliable sources is ambiguous, some sources use the term, others don't. '''N.B.''' This RFC is specifically limited to the use of the ''label'' "fraudster", or equivalent.  There is universal consensus that Holmes' fraud is to be stated early in the lead.

There has been a prolonged debate about the validity of the wording {{tq|the [[Anti-Defamation League]] said the seemingly innocuous phrase began being used online in 2017 as part of an [[alt-right]] trolling campaign and is associated with the [[white supremacist]] movement}} versus {{tq|according to the [[Anti-Defamation League]], a non-governmental organization, the phrase originated online in 2017 as part of an "[[alt-right]] trolling campaign" and as such is associated with the [[white supremacist]] movement}} to describe the phrase ''It's okay to be White'' in the context of this article. The debate, insofar as it has actually taken place, centers around whether wording such as "seemingly innocuous" to describe a political slogan should be written in Wikipedia's voice or attributed to its origin.

Should the desription in lead read as either;

<u>Option A</u> : "... the [[Anti-Defamation League]] said the seemingly innocuous phrase began being used online in 2017 as part of an [[alt-right]] trolling campaign and is associated with the [[white supremacist]] movement."

'''or'''

<u>Option B</u> : "... according to the [[Anti-Defamation League]], <s>a non-governmental organization</s> <small>[attempting to salvage the RFC by boldly removing this, as this is not what discussion is actually about, and no one seems to want it.  revert if you disagree. --[[User:Floquenbeam|Floquenbeam]] ([[User talk:Floquenbeam|talk]])]</small>, the phrase originated online in 2017 as part of an "[[alt-right]] trolling campaign" and as such is associated with the [[white supremacist]] movement."


Please tell us what you think below! If you could format your response in the following way, it would be helpful.

*'''Support Option A''' - This option is great [[User:Unqualified123|Unqualified123]] ([[User talk:Unqualified123|talk]])

Which of the following best describes PrivacyTools.io or PrivacyGuides.org technology articles?

* Option 1: Generally reliable
* Option 2: Additional considerations apply
* Option 3: Generally unreliable

Disclaimer: I may have previously cited either or both of these. Mea Culpa.
Summary: '''Option 3: Generally unreliable''' for both.
Background: As far as I know, neither website has been discussed here previously, but PrivacyTools was previously mentioned (by me) to support a different source. Privacy Guides is a "fork" of Privacy Tools circa 2021. There was [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/PrivacyTools]] in 2019, result: Delete. Oddities: The PrivacyTools article creator, [[User:UnnamedUser]], was blocked for puppetry. The only Keep came from [[User:JonahAragon]], who requested Draft restore in 2021 [[Special:Diff/926083267]], and has recently worked on [[Draft:Privacy Guides]] (with declared COI). They also cited Privacy Guides to add critical comparative statements (negative towards CalyxOS) to [[CalyxOS]] and [[GrapheneOS]], and cited or mentioned PrivacyTools or PrivacyGuides elsewhere: [[Special:Diff/1146474677]], [[Special:Diff/1146473478]]. Privacytools.io has been cited a few times[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=insource%3Aprivacytools.io&title=Special%3ASearch&ns0=1]. Summary: Both websites are group (or individual) blogs (and advocacy sites) without evidence of editorial oversight, and as such are unreliable. -- [[User:Yae4|Yae4]] ([[User talk:Yae4|talk]]) 19:16, 4 April 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
There are two opposing sides to whether a triangular trade existed in colonial times, roughly between 1500 and 1850. On one side, there is the belief that ships would visit three separate areas and trade in a cyclical, clockwise path around the Atlantic Ocean. This would usually include three of these general locations: Western Europe, Western Africa, Eastern South America, the Islands of the Caribbean, Central America, and the Eastern North America. Slaves from Africa would always be included in this triangular trade. And if Europe was visited, North America was not, and vice versa. Images on this page show two common triangular trade routes.

The opposing belief is that slave ships were not able to easily convert to the shipment of raw or manufactured goods, being made almost exclusively for human cargo. Additionally, sailing times and other issues hampered the ability to conduct one circuit in a calendar year. The other argument is that triangular trade was a ''theory'' put forth in the 19th century, but was found difficult to support. This belief essentially says that trade was ''more commonly'' or ''almost exclusively'' bi-lateral, and that gold and silver would have been traded for the slaves rather than a bulk commodity like wood, sugar, or tobacco. Furthermore, triangular trade has few modern, reliable sources supporting it. The triangular trade is said to be a notion that ''introductory ''or ''elementary'' textbooks would teach, and even though the end result was similar to a triangular trade, ''the basic premise is oversimplified (at its least) and false (at its worst)''. This belief would agree to all of the shipping lines shown in triangular trade maps, but that ships were not sailing three of them in a circuit.

This RfC is intended to encompass the debate of the existence of the page, or at least the way it presents the topic as if it was a well-researched overview of the way the [[Atlantic slave trade]] was conducted. I also note that this page seems to be a restatement of the trading portion of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] article, with both articles using notions that largely connect them to one another. If the opposing view is correct, then the article needs to carefully explain that the notion of a triangular trade has limits, or be considered for deletion. However, as another commenter has stated on this page (see ''Caveat?''), it seems to be a trope in history books to refer to triangular Atlantic trade routes, even if its historical basis is tenuous. That makes it a notable topic that would not need deletion, even if determined by consensus to be unhistorical.

This is a massively complicated RFC that can't be distilled into a simple "yes" or no question. So I'm breaking it down into five main questions. 

# Should the subject of abortion ever be mentioned in any state article's political section? (Outside of historical information surrounding abortion.) 
# If #1 is "yes", should information about state's abortion laws be included in every state's body? (Provided that the information from [[WP: RS]] on present law is ''available'', ''verifiable'', and ''clear''.) 
# Should U.S. states that are ''exceptional'' in abortion law have that mentioned in their respective ''leads''? (Either through the criteria I suggested ''or'' an alternative method.) 
# If #3 is "yes", is the criteria I proposed for #3 to determine what is "exceptional" in the "my proposal" section reasonable and should be used as policy going forward? 
# (Optional) Is there any other suggestions/et al. that you want to add?

{{rfcquote|text=
I had asked for a 3rd opinion, but the answer seemed neutral. Amigao has one point of view, and I have another point of view, and we each don't seem to want to budge.

This is the current version of Amigao's paragraph; 
<blockquote>As of 2015, SUCCESS was listed as an "Overseas Chinese Services Organization" by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO), at the time part of the State Council of the People's Republic of China.[9][10][11] In 2018, OCAO was absorbed by the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department.[11]</blockquote>

My main point is that being mentioned on a foreign government website, does not make you a government organization. Also the Chinese characters used to designate a government office were different than what they listed SUCCESS under. Other countries government websites also list ethnic organizations in Canada, does not make every ethnic organization in Canada a foreign government run entity.

Since Amigao insists on suggesting that SUCCESS is a Chinese government office, with constant references to OCAO and the history of OCAO, and undoes any change, I tried to expand on both our points of view with a new subsection, shown https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=S.U.C.C.E.S.S.&oldid=1148603227#Controversy_of_the_affiliation_of_SUCCESS_to_the_Chinese_government

But Amigao keeps undoing everything, with the current explanation that it is too much of an essay.

My main question is: Is there proof that SUCCESS is a Chinese government office?

 Should "alphabet" in [[WP:NCWS]] include letter-sets for specific uses (e.g. [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]], [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], [[Theban alphabet]]), as well as for specific languages (e.g. Somali's [[Kaddare alphabet]] and [[Osmanya alphabet]]; Zaghawa's [[Zaghawa alphabet]]; Mandaic's [[Mandaic alphabet]])?
Background: per Vanisaac's comment opening [[WT:NCWS#Honing in on a consensus]], "I think we are seeing an emerging consensus on 'X script' for all of the scripts out there, eg 'Latin script', ' 'Phags Pa script', 'Jurchen script'; and 'X alphabet' for national alphabets, notation systems, and other symbol collections for specific languages '''''<u>or use</u>''''', eg 'Belarusian Latin Alphabet', 'NATO phonetic alphabet', 'Russian alphabet' (implied Cyrillic), 'American manual alphabet', etc. The plural forms 'X scripts' and 'X alphabets' should be used for describing a family of scripts, and the collection of script conventions for writing a given language or in a particular medium, eg. 'Brahmic scripts', 'Semitic scripts', 'Belarusian alphabets', 'Semaphore alphabets', 'Manual alphabets{{'"}} (''"or use"'' emphasis added by me).

The text later placed by a different editor, without consensus, omitted the "or use:" alternative: {{"'}}Alphabet' is used for '''''<u>language-specific</u>''''' adaptations of a segmental script, usually with a defined sorting order and sometimes with not all of the letters, or with additional letters" (emphasis added again). That same editor has since cited his own text to insist that the ISO basic Latin alphabet, the IPA, and Theban, which can be used by multiple languages, are therefore not "alphabets", but "scripts". As this aspect of the "convention" was not consensus – his draft received two comments, one disagreeing, one not clearly either supporting or opposing – it's a one-person "rule" with no moral force in my opinion. I reverted to reinstate the prior version and add "or use-specific" per the consensus mentioned above: {{"'}}Alphabet' is used for specific applications of a segmental script, usually with a defined sorting order and '''''<u>sometimes with language-specific or use-specific</u>''''' letters" (emphasis added; the text other than "or use-specific" is from the prior version). He reverted my reversion. At this point I decline to edit-war, and instead post this RfC.

It's been two months since I last proposed an RfC on this matter and I've come to realize that I may have formed that RfC poorly. So I'm going to give it a second go (note- I apologize if this is against any policy that I'm aware of)

So, to my question: should the article titles for deceased princesses who received a title from marriage (such as [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll]] in the UK) have their article titles based on:

'''A''' - The title they held at birth, in line with [[WP:CONSORTS]] for the spouses of sovereigns; or (for example: the example I cited above would be moved to [[Princess Louise of the United Kingdom]];<br/>
'''B''' - The highest title they held during their lifetimes (where the example I've used her would remain at the present title).<br/>
'''C''' - whatever [[WP:COMMONNAME]] dictates. (added by [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]])

I understand that some have a problem with seeking consistency where it may not exist in the 'real world'. However, [[WP:CONSISTENT]] is a part of our article titles policy. Even if we don't always abide by it (perhaps not nearly as much as we should, but I digress) we should at least have some form of guideline to abide by if/when consistency is needed. Happy to hear everyone's thoughts, [[User:Estar8806|Estar8806]] ([[User talk:Estar8806|talk]]) 01:35, 10 April 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Should full-size Creative Commons NC, ND, or NCND, or compatible, licensed files be allowed?

'''Context'''

Some files are classified as non-free by Wikipedia standards but are available under a license that permits educational, personal, or otherwise non-commercial use and/or prohibits derivative works. These include certain Creative Commons licenses.

The [[WP:NFCCP|policy]], as currently written, has a number of criteria that must be met in order for a non-free file to be used. One of these is the minimal extent of use which is further specified as "including usage of low-resolution, rather than high-resolution/fidelity/bit rate (especially where the original could be used for deliberate copyright infringement)". Bots enforce this provision by automatically resizing any files deemed too large.

The [[:wmf:Resolution:Licensing policy]] is the ultimate authority in copyright matters. It authorizes projects to develop and adopt an Exemption Doctrine Policy consistent with the resolution, permitting "the upload of copyrighted materials that can be legally used in the context of the project". The proposed change is fully compatible with the resolution.

This proposal was discussed before [[Wikipedia talk:Non-free content#Non-free licensed images| here]].

'''Rationale'''

Low-resolution requirement is in the policy solely because fair use compliance so requires. It is intended to reduce the reusability of the file, and so any adverse commercial impact our use would cause to the copyright holder. However, under these licenses, no fair use considerations are required.

We should always use free files when available, and this change would in no way affect that requirement. However, when we are given the option to either use the file under a claim of fair use and reduce its quality, or use it under a non-free license, we should choose the less bad alternative. To do otherwise would be a disservice to both our readers and re-users. 

It would also better respect the wishes of the copyright holders: they want (and in case of ND explicitly require) us (and the general public) to use their works in their original form, but we are in fact forcibly altering them to a worse quality. I don't think we can even claim our use to be fair if, given the option to use unaltered files, we choose to alter it anyway and misrepresent its quality.

The page is speculation and redundant links AFAICT.

No citation or information in the describes a "de Broglie" microscope. The picture in the page is for an atomic force microscope, a version of a scanning tunneling microscope, unrelated to a matter wave based microscope.

On the other hand, the page has a lot of redundant content from [[Quantum reflection]]

There do exist microscopes fitting the category, 

Koch, Markus, et al. "Imaging with neutral atoms—a new matter‐wave microscope." Journal of microscopy 229.1 (2008): 1-5.

I used this reference in [[Matter wave]] but I removed the link from Matter wave to this page.

IMO the current page would need to be almost completely replaced to be correct. 

"Matter wave microscope" would be an appropriate title. De Broglie said nothing on this subject.

Advice? My specific proposal:
 1) verify that all valuable content is in fact on other pages.
 2) remove the last link to this page
 3) delete
 4) create a new page under an appropriate title if and when resources/ physics progress suggest it.

As we know the new default skin Vector-2022 has a "Clear the watchlist" option on the main watchlist screen beside "Edit raw watchlist" option. Personally, I get scared by its existence here, I have a habit of misclicks and I have 3000+ pages in the watchlist. I can't afford to lose it all. This option may also cause some confusion to non-native English users: "Clear the watchlist" might also mean that the current watchlist screen is cleaned, and not all the pages of watchlist. And ofcourse this is not as widely used an option to merit inclusion right on front of the watchlist screen. People don't put pages on their watchlist only to perform a mass removal 2 days later. This option can safely be moved away from the main page and only inside the edit watchlist pages. This RfC is to determine whether there is consensus among the community to seek such a technical change to the new watchlist. <span class="nowrap">&#8212;'''[[User:CX Zoom|CX Zoom]]'''[he/him]</span> <sup class="nowrap">([[User talk:CX Zoom|let's talk]] • {[[Special:Contributions/CX Zoom|C]]•[[User:CX Zoom/X|X]]})</sup> 07:42, 15 April 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Since the English-language literature is lacking, and the literature, in general, is lacking, what article title should I use for a non-English person?

George of Imotski is referred to in the literature, which is mostly in the Croatian language as "[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=%22Juraj+Imo%C4%87anin%22&btnG= Juraj Imoćanin]" (literally meaning Juraj from Imotski), and in the Latin-language literature, he is referred to simply as "Georgius". The literature on this bishop is ''very lacking'', both in Croatian and Latin, while in English it is practically non-existent. The same situation is with [[Jerome of Trogir]] (who is referred to as "Jeronim Trogiranin" in Croatian, and in Latin as "[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=%22hieronymus+de+Tragurio%22&btnG= Hieronymus de Tragurio]"), [[Nicholas of Zadar]] (who is referred to as "[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=%22Nikola+Zadranin%22&btnG= Nikola Zadranin]" in Croatian, and in Latin as "Nicolaus de Iadera") te [[Vid of Hvar]] (who is referred to as "[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=%22Vid+Hvaranin%22&btnG= Vid Hvaranin]" in Croatian, and in Latin as "[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=%22Vitus+de+Ruschis%22&btnG= Vitus de Ruschis]".

Per [[WP:COMMONNAME]], Wikipedia generally prefers the name that is most commonly used (as determined by its prevalence in a significant majority of independent, reliable ''English-language'' sources. The issue is, there are no English-language sources, only Croatian-language or Latin-language sources.

Per [[WP:UE]], the choice between anglicised and local spellings should follow English-language usage. Here, the issue is the same as explained above, due to the lack of English-language sources.

The same rule continues: "If there are too few reliable English-language sources to constitute an established usage, follow the conventions of the language appropriate to the subject." Does this mean the articles should be renamed to "Juraj Imoćanin", "Jeronim Trogiranin", "Nikola Zadranin" and "Vid Hvaranin". If so, should I use Croatian or Latin conventions?

The issue is complicated further, because, the rule continues: "For lesser known geographical objects or structures with few reliable English sources, follow the translation convention". Does this apply to people as well?

Then, this advice is given to help resolve the issue: "For ideas on how to deal with situations where there are several competing foreign terms, see "Multiple local names" and "Use modern names" in the ''geographical'' naming guideline. Such discussions can benefit from '''''outside opinions''''' so as to avoid a struggle over which language to follow." This is hardly applicable to this situation and I'm in real need of an outside opinion.

The rule then adds this: "In deciding whether and how to translate a foreign name into English, ''follow English-language usage''. If there is ''no established English-language treatment for a name, '''translate''' it if this can be done without loss of accuracy and with greater understanding for the English-speaking reader''." If this is the path I should take, have the translations been done correctly?

The opinions of other editors will help me with naming other similar existing articles I recently created (and mentioned here). Thank you all in advance. [[User:Governor Sheng|Governor Sheng]] ([[User talk:Governor Sheng|talk]]) 21:40, 17 May 2023 (UTC)}}

<s>It is clear that the vast majority of editors want to see the policy stay; however how about clarification? This policy does not, within its current meaning, say that articles bound by the policy, e.g. version history articles, are outright banned. It says to use common sense on the amount of detail to include, and only states ''exaustiveness'', e.g. listing comprehensive release notes for every little change, but major feature highlights and version summarizations (e.g. as seen on [[Fedora Linux release history]] and [[Ubuntu version history]]) should not run afoul of this. So, instead of removing the policy outright (which after having thought about it is indeed a bad idea as it could result in more copyvio happening), how about clarifying the policy to allow highlights of major features and version summarizations directly, while disallowing comprehensive detail such as change-by-change release notes? The previous RFC specifically focused on removal, and clarification wasn't really discussed, so it might be better to have a second RFC. This is what I personally had in mind:

'''Current wording'''
:{{green|'''Exhaustive logs of software updates''' Use reliable third-party (not self-published or official) sources in articles dealing with software updates to describe the versions listed or discussed in the article. Common sense must be applied regarding the level of detail to include.}}

'''Suggested'''
:{{green|'''Exhaustive logs of software updates'''. Use reliable third-party (not self-published or official) sources in articles dealing with software updates to describe the versions listed or discussed in the article. Common sense must be applied regarding the level of detail to include; e.g. comprehensive release notes of individual software versions should be excluded, while major feature highlights and version summarizations should follow the policy on reliable third-party sourcing.}}

With changes of course to perhaps improve wording and remove unnecessary word duplication. But the policy in its current state is open to vast misinterpretation, and has been misinterpreted to turn ''exhaustiveness'' into saying that version history articles are straight up not allowed. So I am seeking opinions and debate on whether or not this policy should be clarified. - [[User:Evelyn Marie|Evelyn Marie]] ([[User_talk:Evelyn Marie|leave a message]] · [[Special:Contributions/Evelyn Marie|contributions]]) 10:16, 15 May 2023 (UTC)}}

I would appreciate feedback on [[User:JBradleyChen/sandbox|my proposed edit]] to the article on [[Scientific racism]], on the inclusion of Thomas Malthus in any form, and on the general editorial approach for this page. 

My proposed edit can be found in [[User:JBradleyChen/sandbox|my sandbox]]. I have not submitted it as an edit to the article as I was hoping to achieve consensus in the [[Talk:Scientific racism#Thomas Malthus|Talk page]] first. [[User:JBradleyChen/sandbox|My current text]] represents multiple compromises I made in deference to feedback from editors:

* that a featured quote from Malthus was too long (05:52, 8 May 2023). I replaced it with a summary.
* opposition to my quote from Chase 1977 identifying Malthus as “the founding father of scientific racism.” (00:58, 7 May 2023) I omitted that quote.
* opposition that my proposed edit was “single sourced” from Chase 1977. I de-emphasized Chase and added arguments based on chattel slavery, Social Darwinism and Eugenics, each with multiple sources exclusive of Chase.

I believe these edits have improved the article, and am grateful for the feedback, but it is unclear to me at this point if other editors were interested in improving my contribution, or were simply opposed to including anything about Malthus at all (17:51, 12 May 2023). They also object to my current draft based on WP:SYNTH. My draft documents the influence of Malthus on Scientific racism, with sources that support his influence on chattel slavery, Social Darwinism, and Eugenics.  The editors assert that the association of Malthus with Scientific racism depends on WP:SYNTH via intermediate concepts of chattel slavery, Social Darwinism and Eugenics. My position is that chattel slavery, Social Darwinism, and Eugenics are racism, hence SYNTH is not required, and also that [[Wikipedia:What SYNTH is not#SYNTH is not a rigid rule|SYNTH is not a rigid rule]]. Note I do not claim that Malthus was racist, only that he influenced Scientific racism.

This RfC should probably focus on Thomas Malthus, but if reviewers are inclined I would also welcome more general input on this article. My proposed edit is also a compromise. Earlier, [[Talk:Scientific racism#Recognizing Egalitarian Contributions|I commented]] that the Scientific racism page as written is very negative, and tends to demean competent scientists like Linnaeus and Rush and Darwin who argued for egalitarianism in their time. Rush and Darwin were also active opponents of slavery, hard to discern from this article. The article as structured makes it hard for a reader to recognize the trajectory of major themes in Scientific racism, such as polygenism, Social Darwinism and Eugenics. Instead it anchors on the immature science and decontextualized racism of pre-modern scholars. Meanwhile it ignores figures such as Malthus, Herbert Spencer, Lewis Terman and William Shockley, whose impact on Social Darwinism and Eugenics is well documented. While I don’t understand the overall editorial strategy, I do understand tactically why it’s been hard for me to include Malthus: the editors’ readiness to litigate technical details, making consensus on change difficult.

{{rfcquote|text=
I intend to promote this article to the "Good article status", as it is an important topic and we should cover it thoroughly. I started researching it a few weeks ago and discovered some additional coverage which we can use to expand the article. To get an impartial opinion, I'm starting this RfC:

The lead paragraph of this article is mainly supported by citations from publications such as: ''[[The Advocate (magazine)|The Advocate]]'', ''[[Medscape]]'', ''Clinical Practice in Pediatric Psychology'', Yale report, and Trans Safety Network. However, upon closer examination, the accuracy and reliability of these sources come into question. 

1. ''The Medscape'' citation fails [[WP:V]] standards as I couldn't verify the statement. 

2. ''The Clinical Practice in Pediatric Psychology'' has since retracted its quoted statement, rendering it invalid ([https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fcpp0000482 retracted link]). I'm, therefore, removing this statement.

3. ''The Advocate'''s is merely a brief mention of SEGM and its inclusion in the lead is undue. The characterization of SEGM as a "biased group" or "not a recognized scientific association" is also contestable due to the newspaper's natural bias and should be attributed.

4. An article from ''[[Science-Based Medicine]]'' (its Wikipedia page describes it as a "blog"), is authored by AJ Eckert, a [https://anchorhealthct.org/providers/aj-eckert/ trans doctor]. As a result, their viewpoint may be subject to potential bias. This statement is undue in the lead and should be attributed within the "Reception section".

5. A referenced report from Yale should be considered with caution, as it is explicitly noted that "[https://medicine.yale.edu/lgbtqi/research/gender-affirming-care/biased-science/ This report reflects the academic work of individual Yale faculty and does not represent the views of Yale University, Yale Law School, or Yale School of Medicine]." I believe attribution should resolve the issue, but placing it in the lead is undue.

6. Another reference used is by Trans Safety Network which isn't a publication but an [https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/13739860  activist organization registered as a CIC in the UK]. It is an opinion and therefore should be attributed and placing it in the lead is unwarranted.

SEGM has been discussed positively in major publications, like ''[[The Economist]]'' described it as "an international group of concerned clinicians" on [https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/04/05/the-evidence-to-support-medicalised-gender-transitions-in-adolescents-is-worryingly-weak 5 April 2023], a non-profit group on [https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/28/questioning-americas-approach-to-transgender-health-care 28 July 2022], an international group of doctors and researchers on [https://www.economist.com/international/2020/12/12/an-english-ruling-on-transgender-teens-could-have-global-repercussions 12 December 2020], so the current description is not justified. Some other publications like ''[[AP News]]'' describe it as a "nonprofit group of health professionals who are concerned about medical transition risks for minors" on [https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2022-05-04/early-transgender-identity-endures-study-suggests 4 May 2022], ''[[The Australian]]'' described it as "A new international watchdog, the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine, which includes clinicians with expertise in gender dysphoria" [https://www.proquest.com/docview/2568465547 on 1 May 2020] and as "new global body" [https://www.proquest.com/docview/2371886702].

So, coming to my question. Should we describe SEGM as "It is not recognized as a scientific organization by the international medical community" in the lead based on brief mentions in ''The Advocate'', opinion of spokesperson in ''Medscape'', or description in local publications like ''WyoFile'' that cites some other source for that description. In my opinion, it is ill-defined when reliable sources like ''The Economist'', ''The Australian'', ''AP News'' describe it differently. I tried to find such mention in scientific organizations/watchdogs that may have officially described SEGM in this manner. However, upon further research, no such statements from specific organizations could be identified.

Thus, we should work on revising the lead paragraph to present a more objective and neutral perspective, avoiding the selective use of quotes. This will ensure that the information provided is both accurate and reliable, in accordance with Wikipedia's guidelines.

Before what I have done (as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transnational_authoritarianism&oldid=1150925517 the version at 20:41, 20 April 2023‎] ),there are two main Problems about the Page "Transnational authoritarianism":

1.Most sources are using and talking about "Transnational repression" but they are written here as "Transnational authoritarianism" , for example:It is "Typology of Transnational Repression" by [https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article/63/4/480/2402855?login=false the source], but here "Typology of transnational authoritarianism". Is that go against [[Wikipedia:No original research]] and [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]]? Or "Transnational repression" ="Transnational authoritarianism" ?

2.I can not find the quote to "A number of actors; principally countries governed by authoritarian states are known to engage in transnational repression of dissident and diaspora communities abroad including but not limited to: China, Saudi Arabia, Rwanda, Turkey and Iran. " and "A range of states engage in these actions, from Russian assassinations to forced disappearances of Chinese and Hong Kong citizens abroad. Freedom House details the extensive use of transnational authoritarianism by a rising number of countries across the world.". Are these [[Wikipedia:SYNTH|"Synthesis of published material"]]: A. These countries are authoritarian states + B.These countries have transnational repression → C. These countries are transnational authoritarianism?

Since most sources used "transnational repression", should it be moved from "Transnational authoritarianism" to "Transnational Repression"? And take "Transnational authoritarianism" as a subset of "Transnational Repression", because  transnational authoritarianism is "an authoritarian state repress one or more existing or potential members of its emigrant or diaspora communities". The essence of transnational authoritarian is transnational repression.

PS:I am still want to know about the definition of the situation of  Edward Snowden. He is forced to in exile in russia([https://www.cfr.org/interview/extraditing-edward-snowden "From Snowden’s perspective, the U.S. government is seeking his return for the purpose of persecuting him..".];[https://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/24/politics/nsa-snowden-options/index.html “We have forced him effectively into exile ...”]), so is he under the transnational repression from U.S. government?

{{rfcquote|text=
Shall the third paragraph of the lede mention "a delayed response to the AIDS epidemic"? 

HIV/AIDS is arguably the most influential and pervading disease of the second half of the 20th and the 21st centuries, and Reagan's reaction is still consequential today, with more than 700,000 Americans as of today dead of the virus. I think that the RfC on this topic from several years ago was properly sourced and valid, but their sentence was not optimal as far as WP:NPOV goes. 

My proposed sentence at the moment would be '''"Reagan also headed a delayed governmental response to the AIDS epidemic during his tenure."''' This would be located the end of the third paragraph of the lede, since that paragraph as written right now is split between first and second terms. This sentences ''does not'' says that he personally "ignored" the crisis, which is an admittedly subjective view, but does specify that the response was not very proactive, which is [https://www.c-span.org/classroom/document/?17826 a statement] largely agreed upon by many [https://www.history.com/news/aids-epidemic-ronald-reagan historians] and [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23253449 scholars] and in the news media [https://exhibits.library.gsu.edu/out-in-the-archives/hiv-aids/reagans-response/ both] [https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/18/us/reagan-defends-financing-for-aids.html contemporaneously] [https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/when-aids-was-funny-short-film-reveals-shortfalls-reagan-response-aids-msna735296 and] [https://apnews.com/article/b220ec4793a64a11b657f44f59232afb retrospectively].

Input is requested regarding how to end the opening sentence of this article, following the words "Charles III (Charles Philip Athur George; born 14 November 1948)..." Prior discussion on the matter has taken place [[#Lede|here]] and [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject British Royalty/Charles III task force#Lead section|here]].

Presently, there are six options:

# is king of [[Commonwealth realm|14 independent countries]], in addition to the [[United Kingdom]].
# is king of 14 independent countries, in addition to the [[United Kingdom]], collectively known as the [[Commonwealth realm]]s.
# is king of [[Commonwealth realm|15 independent countries]], including the [[United Kingdom]].
# is [[king of the United Kingdom]] and the 14 other [[Commonwealth realms]].
# is [[king of the United Kingdom]] and 14 other independent countries, all known as the [[Commonwealth realm]]s.
# is [[king of the United Kingdom]], [country], [country], [country], and the [X] other [[Commonwealth realms]]. [Which countries are named depending on a to-be-determined criteria]

Issues of concern appear to be, so far:

* Brevity (without sacrificing accuracy of information, both explicit and implied)
* Giving prominence to the United Kingdom/Charles' role as king of the United Kingdom
* Not relegating countries that belong to the G7, G20, TPP, NATO, and/or are otherwise relatively significant on the global stage into a diminished group of "other"
* Expressing the reality of the equality of status between the Commonwealth realms and Charles' offices as king of each
* The difference between role and title
* Reader unfamiliarity with the term "Commonwealth realm"

Please state your preference or preferences in order of preference. The aim is to form a consensus within the next week, ahead of Charles' coronation on 6 May; though, it is acknowledged that this may not happen. 04:30, 28 April 2023 (UTC)}}

Background: There is a dispute over the direction of Libreboot, and the name is now being used by two projects. The new GNU/FSF website[https://libreboot.at/][https://web.archive.org/web/20230320220851/https://libreboot.at/] and project was announced in March at a Libreplanet presentation.[https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/taking-control-over-the-means-of-production-free-software-boot/] Some discussion of issues is at libreboot.org.[https://libreboot.org/news/policy.html]

At this article, these changes, [[Special:Diff/1146204066/1149329352]], on April 11, added a basic statement, but were reverted and called "VANDALISM" by these changes, [[Special:Diff/1149329352/1152487905]], on April 30.

The infoboxes of [[Pearl Mackie]], [[Peter Hawkins]], [[Danny Kirwan]], and [[Tony Sewell, Baron Sewell of Sanderstead]] read "Born... [[Brixton]], London, England". For a short while, so did the infobox for [[David Bowie]]; then "Brixton" was removed from that last infobox, on the grounds that only a "city" should be named, and Brixton is not a city (though it has a larger population than 17 of the USA's state capitals, and in-real-life form fields marked "city" are routinely filled in with names of other place-types – town, village, etc. – where appropriate).

Samuel Dash attended Central High School in Philadelphia, and I recently stumbled upon a photograph of him in that high school's June 2, 1942 edition of the school's newspaper. I found a handful of these newspapers when looking through my grandfather's old things. The photograph is a black and white portrait of Samuel Dash in a suit along with a short article about him titled "Dash and ILSA Move To Aid in War Effort". The high school newspaper was called the "The Centralizer", and the photograph in question was in the Vol. XXXIX No. 10 June 2, 1942 edition of the newspaper. No copyright identifiers or indications are contained anywhere in the newspaper.

My question is, would it be permissible to include this photograph in the Samuel Dash article? Would this pose any copyright issues? And, would this pose any privacy related issues? [[User:Hmoon9|Hmoon9]] ([[User talk:Hmoon9|talk]]) 03:03, 4 June 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Should the infoboxes for [[Charles III]] (and other descendants of [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Philip Mountbatten]], and by extension their respective spouses where appropriate) include a mention of their agnatic descent from the house to which Prince Philip belonged. This is done for [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Juliana]], [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] and [[Willem-Alexander]] of the Netherlands and for [[Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] and [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]].

If the agnatic house is included should it be:
* the [[House of Glücksburg]], the house of the [[kings of Greece]] from which Philip (and therefore his children) biologically descend; or
* the [[House of Mountbatten]], the house in which Philip was 'adopted' before his marriage to Elizabeth in 1947, and therefore the house to which he would have technically belonged when his children were born?

Both houses are mentioned on Philip's article.

''For simplicity, responses in the format of '''Support (Glücksburg)''', '''Support (Mountbatten)''', or '''Oppose''' are preferable''

One thing leads to another.  I saw a bunch of LTA pages that should have been archived and requested that to be done [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ALong-term_abuse&diff=1155307186&oldid=1149736158#Semi-protected_edit_request_on_17_May_2023].  

Looking at the discussion, I saw that one admin recommended that the page be marked historical due to a relative lack of recent edits over the past 7-8 years [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Help_desk&oldid=1155828003#WP:ER_on_WP:LTA].  

I think Wikipedia has gotten better at preventing long-term abuse, so the number of LTAs has declined in the past few years.  Many vandals also celebrate the recognition they get from these kinds of pages. The Long-term abuse page should be marked as historical. What do you think?

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
Should pages in the Category:Emotion and other related pages on human expression have a dedicated Infobox, either an existing one or a new Infobox (such as Template:Infobox emotion) specifically designed for emotions?

Currently, all the pages related to emotions, moods, and virtues do not include an Infobox. While it is true that the topic of "Emotion" is best expressed and explained through descriptive phrases, an Infobox can provide a concise overview of general information and characteristics of a particular emotion at a glance. Additionally, it may assist readers in understanding the basic features, specifications, and related groups of an emotion or expression. According to the [[MOS:INFOBOXUSE]], no page is prohibited from having an Infobox, nor is it mandatory. Therefore, utilizing an Infobox could potentially enhance the presentation of information in a structured and easily understandable format. 

To provide a basic idea, an Infobox about emotions could include parameters such as the extreme and mild versions of the emotion, synonyms, opposites, opposite extreme and mild emotions, dyads (based on the [[Emotion classification#Plutchik's wheel of emotions|wheel of emotions]]), primary, secondary, and tertiary groups of the emotion, disposition or outlook, term meaning and origin, as well as general characteristics like symptoms, expression, causes, specialty, duration, evolution, treatment, diagnosis, coping mechanisms, and neurological or psychological factors. However, it's important to note that these are general ideas for the potential information that could be included. 

In conclusion, considering the benefits an Infobox can provide in terms of presenting information in a structured and accessible manner, it is worth considering whether the pages in the Category:Emotions and related topics should have an Infobox.[[User:Prarambh20|Prarambh20]] ([[User talk:Prarambh20|talk]]) 21:17, 6 June 2023 (UTC)}}

Should the current image be replaced? Consensus is needed on the most appropriate image to use as the main image in this article. The current image shows a glass building facade; it is a [[Commons:Quality images|Quality image]], used when the article was promoted to GA, and is instantly recognisable as glass of the most common and widespread type. However, it has been criticized as an oversimplification of what glass is and a somewhat corporate and "generic picture". An alternative has been proposed which shows a glass figurine being manufactured; while it might be less recognisable it shows glass in it's 'raw' form in both the molten and solid-state, indicating how glass can be used to make a variety of products and forms. The two images under discussion are provided below.

This is a request for comment on whether the Orthodox Baháʼí Faith should be included in the see also section of the Baháʼí Faith article. The Orthodox Baháʼí Faith is a Baha'i sect that believes in the continuation of the Guardianship of the Baháʼí Faith after Shoghi Effendi. The mainstream Baháʼís consider them as Covenant-breakers and do not recognize their legitimacy. The dispute is about whether the link to the Orthodox Baháʼí Faith Wikipedia page is relevant and notable enough to be included in the see also section.

 days remaining on RfC.
{{User:ClueBot III/DoNotArchiveUntil|1687024909}}
As discussed previously, in the edit request above, i propose the re-addition of the full lyrics to "The Star-Spangled Banner" to this article.

Users @[[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] and @[[User:Magnolia677|Magnolia677]] have removed all but the first stanza of the US national anthem. The guideline they cited, [[WP:NOTLYRICS]] has a clear exception for songs such as national anthems, which this article is about. When justifying their edits, Magnolia677 stated that their concern was that the full lyrics were 32 lines long, ignoring the pages of longer anthems, such as those of Turkey's [[İstiklal Marşı]] (40 lines) and Italy's [[Il Canto degli Italiani]] (48 lines not counting chorus) among others. The question is, should the full lyrics be included in the article, or not? Use the Support template if yes, and the Oppose template if no. Should the consensus be in favor of re-addition, the lyrics will be re-added to the article, either by me or another editor. If you're not sure about your opinion, but want to support or oppose, consult the appropriate policies for advice. Thanks for reading and discussing.

As discussed previously, in the edit request above, i propose the re-addition of the full lyrics to "The Star-Spangled Banner" to this article.

Users @[[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] and @[[User:Magnolia677|Magnolia677]] have removed all but the first stanza of the US national anthem. The guideline they cited, [[WP:NOTLYRICS]] has a clear exception for songs such as national anthems, which this article is about. When justifying their edits, Magnolia677 stated that their concern was that the full lyrics were 32 lines long, ignoring the pages of longer anthems, such as those of Turkey's [[İstiklal Marşı]] (40 lines) and Italy's [[Il Canto degli Italiani]] (48 lines not counting chorus) among others. The question is, should the full lyrics be included in the article, or not? Use the Support template if yes, and the Oppose template if no. Should the consensus be in favor of re-addition, the lyrics will be re-added to the article, either by me or another editor. If you're not sure about your opinion, but want to support or oppose, consult the appropriate policies for advice. Thanks for reading and discussing.

{{rfcquote|text=
This RfC seeks to address whether the review aggregator [[OpenCritic]] should be adopted alongside [[Metacritic]], our current standard. [[Template_talk:Video_game_reviews/Archive_5#Adding_OpenCritic_as_a_review_aggregator|The last RfC from 2017]] concluded that, at the time, OpenCritic was not cited by enough [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] to justify its inclusion, in addition to concerns that its average scores were too similar to Metacritic's (creating a redundancy problem). The issue has cropped up again from time to time and there seems to be agreement amongst editors that the situation has changed enough to warrant another RfC.

One point of contention is that OpenCritic has become far more mainstream. ''[[Video Games Chronicle]]'' regularly cites OpenCritic (examples: [https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-is-the-worst-reviewed-game-of-2023/][https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lost-ark-has-topped-20-million-players-worldwide/][https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/elden-ring-looks-likely-to-have-smashed-souls-sales-records-in-the-uk/]), its ranking of a certain game attracted considerable attention in sources considered reliable at [[WP:VG/S]] recently (examples: [https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-is-the-highest-rated-game-ever-on-opencritic/], [https://www.vg247.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-highest-rated-game-all-time], [https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-is-now-the-highest-rated-game-of-all-time-on-opencritic], [https://www.shacknews.com/article/135456/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-opencritic-highest-rated]), and both [[Epic Games Store]] ([https://www.gamesindustry.biz/epic-games-stores-avoids-review-bombing-with-opencritic-integration]) and [[GOG.com]] ([https://www.gog.com/news/gog_2022_update_6_opencritic_reviews_on_our_gamecards]) have integrated it into game listings. It is safe to say that the situation regarding OpenCritic's presence in reliable sources is not the same as it was in 2017.

Another common point of contention concerns the site's Critics Recommend metric, which is a different form of measurement from the averages that Metacritic and OpenCritic itself provide. Rather than averaging review scores, Critics Recommend designates reviews as positive or negative and uses them to provide a percentage, similar to [[Rotten Tomatoes]]' Tomatometer. [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Video_games/Archive_156#OpenCritic_Percentage_Recommended_Score|A 2021 discussion regarding incorporating this metric specifically]] ended in no consensus, although by headcount a narrow majority of editors supported the proposal.

{{rfcquote|text=
I see two major problems with Larkin's ratings system (at least in the context of Wikipedia):

1) He does not "score" albums out of five in the style of a ''Rolling Stone'' or ''Record Mirror''. ''The Encyclopedia of Popular Music'' states that Larkin and his team's system is "different to most 5 star ratings in that ''we rate according to the artist in question's work''. Therefore, a 4 star album from the Beatles will have the overall edge over a 4 star album by Chicory Tip." This makes Larkin's ratings incongruent with other scores included in scores boxes on album articles, as he could conceivably hold X's 1-star album to be as accomplished as Y's 5-star album.

2) ''Larkin's system is inherently non-objective''. By his own admission, his ratings are influenced by "review ratings of the credible music journals and critics' opinions". As well as leaning on the opinions of others, what is "credible", is of course, highly subjective.

I don't see any issue with Wikipedia continuing to use Larkin's ''prose'', but I believe it should be written into the music Manual of Style that we avoid his album ratings. Hopefully this will foster some discussion. Thanks. [[Special:Contributions/81.157.51.237|81.157.51.237]] ([[User talk:81.157.51.237|talk]]) 20:35, 14 May 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
As per the '''[[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2023 January 22#Template:Infobox aircraft begin|consensus reached in the merger discussion]]''', the templates {{tl|Infobox aircraft begin}}, {{tl|Infobox aircraft type}}, {{tl|Infobox aircraft career}}, {{tl|Infobox aircraft engine}}, and {{tl|Infobox aircraft program}} are intended to be merged into "{{tl|Infobox aircraft}}". Based on the outcome of the merger discussion, '''two proposals''' have been presented: one suggesting a direct, common and singular merger of all the Infoboxes, and the other proposing an alternative approach rather than a common merge.

'''Proposal 1:''' [[Special:Permalink/1156443664|Merged Version]]:

This version involves a direct, comprehensive merger with the intention of creating a singular and standardized Infobox aircraft template. [[Special:Permalink/1156443664|The merged version]] incorporates all parameters and labels from each of the original Infoboxes, In some cases, similar parameters from those Infoboxes are presented under a common label. It also allows for simple replacement options and adheres to [[MOS:IB]].

''(The merged version refers to the current iteration of the Infobox aircraft.)''

Further discussions regarding the merged version: Initially, this merged version contained some spaces that were subsequently removed following discussions on the talk page. Additionally, it includes Infobox aircraft engine '''as decided in the TfD''', although some editors have expressed opposition to including aircraft engine, and have suggested initiating discussion challenging the TfD closing statement to deliberate whether or not to include the Infobox aircraft engine. However, a definitive conclusion has not yet been reached.

'''Proposal 2:''' [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Aircraft/Infobox refactor 2023|Alternative Approach]]:

An alternative approach has been presented in a two-step process, which advocates for maintaining standalone Infoboxes instead of merging them into a single Infobox. This approach suggests merging only {{tl|Infobox aircraft begin}} into each of the four Infoboxes, while proposing the replacement of Infobox aircraft engine with other engine-specific Infoboxes, such as reciprocating, turbine, rocket engines, and electric motors, based on the context of each page.

''For a clearer understanding of this alternative approach, we encourage you to review the discussions on the [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Aircraft/Infobox refactor 2023]] page.''

Now the question arises: should we adopt the merged version (Proposal1) or follow the alternative approach (Proposal2)?

*'''Option 1:''' Support the merged version as per Proposal 1. 
*'''Option 2:''' Support the merged version, excluding the Infobox aircraft engine. 
*'''Option 3:''' Support the alternative approach, Proposal 2. 
*'''Option 4:''' Support the alternative approach, but with modifications or additional considerations (please specify). 
*'''Other:''' (please provide your specific suggestion or proposal).

Andrew Johnson, the law passed by Congress and the Supreme Court declared August 20, 1866 as the date of the end of the Civil War, while Infobox makes no mention of this date. Since I can't make a major edit without broad consensus, I've created an rfc to fix the problem.

Almost all articles on Wikipedia are available for editing by registered editors and visitors. These articles are [[Open collaboration|collectively written]] via a [[wiki]] system; as such articles on Wikipedia generally provide more up-to-date information and have a wider range in reliability than paper encyclopedias. Though the [[Wikipedia community]] is popularly known by its [[Anarchy|anarchical]] structure, the community has adopted elements of [[Democracy|democratic]] and [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] systems, as demonstrated by the establishment of [[Wikipedia:User access levels|user rights]], policies, guidelines, and the final avenue of dispute resolution – the [[Arbitration Committee]].

Wikipedia was launched by [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Larry Sanger]] on January 15, 2001, as a publicly editable encyclopedia initially associated with [[Nupedia]]. Both of these projects were owned by the [[Bomis]] company. As Wikipedia became increasingly more popular than Nupedia, its website experienced a rapid growth in content, editors, and language availability. In 2003, Wikipedia was transitioned from a commercial to a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] encyclopedia and is now hosted by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], based in the [[United States]]. Around late 2000s, as Wikipedia became [[List of most visited websites|one of the most visited websites]] in the world, the number of active editors reached its peak and has since remained stable.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mandiberg |first=Michael |date=February 23, 2020 |title=Mapping Wikipedia |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/02/where-wikipedias-editors-are-where-they-arent-and-why/605023/ |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211115131524/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/02/where-wikipedias-editors-are-where-they-arent-and-why/605023/https://web.archive.org/web/20211115131524/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/02/where-wikipedias-editors-are-where-they-arent-and-why/605023/ |archive-date=November 15, 2021 |access-date=November 26, 2021 |website=The Atlantic |language=en}}</ref> Throughout its existence, Wikipedia consistently faced concerns about its [[Reliability of Wikipedia|reliability]], [[systemic bias]] and its [[Wikipedia community|editor base]], though over time the website began to be viewed more positively, largely due to the overall improvement in the quality of its articles.

For a long time with regard to the name of sports stadiums with sponsored names, it has generally been an unwritten rule on sports stadium articles (particularly in UK football and rugby related ones) that these names are not used for the title unless the stadium has never had a non-sponsored name to avoid Wikipedia being seen to endorse commercial entities. Henceforth, I wish to formalise this by proposing that a section be added to the Article Titles policy stating:

Prevous RSN discussions: None found.

Talk discussions : [[Talk:/e/_(operating_system)#Recent_edits_by_User:Yae4 |one found]] in 2019; thin consensus, including me, was not reliable. {{u|Newslinger}} called it a "group blogs with no reputations".

An author "Christine Hall" is cited on a few editor talk pages, but I don't think it is the same Christine Hall.

About a dozen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=insource%3Afossforce&title=Special:Search&profile=advanced&fulltext=1&ns0=1 articles cite FossForce.com].

Three cites that have been removed from [[Libreboot]] over time include:
*[https://fossforce.com/2016/09/libreboot-leaves-gnu-claiming-gender-identity-discrimination-fsf/ September 2016]
*[https://fossforce.com/2017/01/gnu-officially-boots-libreboot/ January 2017]
*[https://fossforce.com/2017/04/libreboot-reorganizes-seeks-amends/ April 2017]

*'''Option 2: Additional considerations apply''': While the articles are mostly by one author/editor, I contrast FossForce.com with somewhat similar (at a glance) liliputing.com, which was deemed generally unreliable blog, self-published source [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_278#Liliputing.com_blog_as_a_reliable_source? in this RSN discussion and RfC]. FossForce, to me, covers FOSS topics with more insight than just re-publicizing a single press release or vendor post, and discusses the info in some detail. FossForce also covers FOSS topics - not just new products up for sale - over time, as shown by the three cites above. While the FossForce website does show advertisements, it again contrasts with Liliputing by NOT being affiliate-spam directly connected to PR announcements about products being written about. Therefore, I feel this otherwise marginal source should be allowed, particularly for FOSS articles with few generally reliable sources.

[[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_407|A May 2023 RSN discussion about Healthline]] raises the question about whether Healthline should be deprecated as generally unreliable or blacklisted as fabrication and spam on many of its health-related article pages. 

[[Healthline]]: [http://www.healthline.com/]

Healthline is frequently used by novice editors to source medical, nutrition, and lifestyle content. Its name implies health expertise, and its author(s) or editors are identified as having "medically reviewed" articles, despite most having no medical expertise (BS or MS degrees in non-medical fields). Healthline commonly cites individual primary studies to extrapolate to an anti-disease effect or "health benefit", a term used in many of its articles on foods, phytochemicals, and supplements.

Previous RSN discussion: Feb 2022 [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_366#Nutritional_information_(Healthline/USDA)|goji berries]]

Examples of spam health misinformation are Healthline articles on [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coffee-worlds-biggest-source-of-antioxidants coffee antioxidants ("Many of coffee’s positive health effects may be due to its impressive content of powerful antioxidants")], [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/black-tea-benefits#benefits anti-disease effects of black tea], [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ashwagandha "proven health benefits" of ashwagandha], and [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-benefits-of-blueberries "proven health benefits" of blueberries], among dozens of others. Search "antioxidant" on Healthline and browse any retrieved article for the extent of misinformation (where only vitamins A-C-E apply as antioxidants for the human diet).

Diffs on [[goji]]  - [[Talk:Goji#No_health_benefits?|this talk discussion on goji nutrition and health benefits]]; continued further [[Talk:Goji#Really?_there_needs_to_be_a_Nutrition_chapter|here]].

Numerous others under my history, [https://sigma.toolforge.org/summary.py?name=Zefr&search=healthline&server=enwiki&max=500&ns= here.]

It may be justified to blacklist Healthline as a perpetual source of fabrication and spam. Similar to reputations in scientific publishing generally, blatant misinformation destroys confidence permanently in the rest of the source. 

Seeing an edit containing a Healthline source is [[WP:REDFLAG]] for revising or reverting the edit. There are no circumstances where a Healthline source could not be MEDRS-sourced. 

Healthline should be blacklisted. [[User:Zefr|Zefr]] ([[User talk:Zefr|talk]]) 19:26, 28 May 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Frequently, contracts between sports teams and players/coaches are leaked to media outlets before they are officially announced.

This essay is often invoked to keep any mention of these reported details out of articles until the signing is officially announced [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monty_Williams&diff=prev&oldid=1158175674], and articles are protected to prevent new editors from adding the information. For examples: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Doc_Rivers&oldid=1155093001] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=D._J._Moore&oldid=1143971335]

This RfC is to determine if the following line should be altered:

{{quote|''If anything is to be presented at all, it should be limited to prose attributed to the source that is reporting the transaction.''}}

I would propose revising it to read like this:

{{quote|''Updates to articles subject to a reported transaction should be limited to prose that specifically [[WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV|attributes]] the source that is reporting the transaction.''}}

This change would codify and encourage Wikipedians old and new to cover what reliable sources will often widely report, but in a non-crystally way that communicates the uncertainty. An example of how that could look is in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monty_Williams&oldid=1158044193 Monty Williams' article].

Should the current lead sentence...

{{tq2|The report concluded the FBI had showed confirmation bias and a "serious lack of analytical rigor" toward the information they received, especially information the FBI received from politically affiliated persons and entities.}}

be amended to include this bold content...

{{tq2|The report concluded the FBI had showed confirmation bias and a "serious lack of analytical rigor" toward the information they received, especially information the FBI received from politically affiliated persons and entities. '''Durham asserted this information "in part triggered" the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, echoing a <s>disproved</s> conspiracy theory promoted by Trump supporters.'''}}

This question is rooted in what [[Charlie Savage (author)|Charlie Savage]] exclusively reported in ''The New York Times'':

{{tq2|Mr. Durham went beyond criticizing the wiretap applications, writing: "Our investigation also revealed that senior F.B.I. personnel displayed a serious lack of analytical rigor toward the information that they received, especially information received from politically affiliated persons and entities. This information in part triggered and sustained Crossfire Hurricane and contributed to the subsequent need for Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation."}}

{{tq2|But in using the word "triggered," Mr. Durham’s report echoed a conspiracy theory pushed by supporters of Mr. Trump that the F.B.I. opened the investigation in July 2016 based on the so-called Steele dossier, opposition research indirectly funded by the Clinton campaign that was later discredited.[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/15/us/politics/trump-russia-investigation-durham.html]}}

<s>The NYT does not use the word "disproved" but that can be readily sourced if this edit is ultimately adopted.</s>

Should the capitalization of titles for specific nations' armed forces members follow their own nations' practices, e.g. "Spanish marine" but "[U.S.] Marine" and (U.K.) "Royal Marine" for individuals? For instance:
* [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/01/23/afghan-asylum-seeker-murdered-aspiring-royal-marine/ "An Afghan double killer was able to sneak into Britain posing as a 14-year-old schoolboy before going on to murder an aspiring Royal Marine, it has emerged."]
* [https://www.defense.gov/Multimedia/Photos/igphoto/2001718628/ "A Spanish marine, left, explains how her weapon works to a U.S. Marine...."]
This presumes the terms not attached to any specific nation remain uncapitalized, e.g. [[List of marines and naval infantry forces|"Many countries around the world maintain marines and naval infantry military units."]]

While many sources refer to this release (''Trying Not to Think About It'') as an EP, as does JoJo herself, it doesn't appear to fit the definition of one on the [[extended play]] page. Both its length time-wise (33 minutes) and its number of songs (12, or 8 if you discount the intro and interludes) are more befitting of a full-length [[album]]. Should we thus leave it labeled as is, per JoJo's categorization, or instead label it as what other projects of this scope and length would typically be labeled as?

It makes no sense to include non-produced (or, as is the case with Helstrom and the [[Talk:Helstrom_(TV_series)#Request_for_comment_on_Wiki_protocol_regarding_MCU_debate|consensus]] that was reached on its page last year and comments by the creator, EXPLICITLY non-canon, non-MCU brand) shows with the canon, MCU shows. As it is, it seems designed to confuse and preserve a narrative about Helstrom’s canonicity within the brand (which simply does not exist in reality.) The reason the changes make sense is *because* they honor the fact that the shows/imprints were initially planned to be part of the MCU, despite this ultimately not being the case. 

Now, the argument could be made that the viewer can find the information that it is not part of the MCU on the page itself, but this is foolish. Many will take what is stated (and what is implied by the exclusion of clarification) in the infobox for granted, as I believe is the hope of those who maintain the presence of Helstrom/Adventure Into Fear within the MCU brand without providing the caveat that the show is not actually a part of the brand.

Because there are shows that were planned for channels but never released on the channels, it is simultaneously weird that they are included almost as co-equals with the other shows in their respective sections (albeit with the caveat that they were unreleased) and fortuitous that there are multiple incidents of this happening. Why is it fortuitous? Because that’s exactly why they lend themselves to a section of their own: shows or imprints that were either cancelled or reworked to not be in the MCU.

 Rotten Tomatoes being cited for [[WP:BLP]] '''

I hope I'm doing this right as I don't have any experience doing [[WP:RfC]], but I often come across RT being used a source for an actor's DOB and I revert them since they seem like a rather poor source when it comes to [[WP:DOB]] as they have the incorrect one for other actors and there are some actors that have age disputes on Wikipedia, the DOBs that RT have are most certain incorrect because other info for those actors such as what year they graduated high school or college are on their pages(with legit cited sources) and those years don't match up to the DOB RT has listed. I asked this a few months ago and pretty much all of the editors that replied agreed that since RT is not a journalism site and that it's main purpose is film criticism, it shouldn't be used as a source for [[WP:DOB]].

{{rfcquote|text=
The article for the [[killing of Nahel Merzouk]] features a non-free video of the incident as the lead media. The file [[Wikipedia:Files for discussion/2023 July 1#File:Killing of Nael M. Video.ogv|has been nominated for deletion]] with users claiming that a video cannot meet the [[WP:NFCC#3]] minimal usage requirements. This is despite the fact that [[WP:NFC]] permits the usage of non-free videos, so long as it's a minimal sample, akin to audio files.

I've noticed that there appears to be a lack of precedent and discussion regarding non-free videos, with even [[WP:NFC]] lacking a comprehensive, dedicated section to it, merely grouping it with other types of NF media (in contrast, for example, audio files have [[WP:SAMPLE]]). The argument used by those espousing for the file's deletion is that you can technically claim that 10 seconds is enough, then 9, then 8, and so on, so it inherently cannot meet minimum usage requirements; this is despite NF audio clips suffering from the same issue. There appears to be not standard in place for this and I think that we really ought to address this instead of leaving it in limbo to establish a set precedent.

The issue is that however you put it, the rationale of "a video cannot be NFC" is fundamentally at odds with [[WP:NFC]], which again does permit the use of non-free videos, and again, we acknowledge that non-free audio excerpts can fall under fair use despite having the same issue of "what's minimal usage" (hell, you can even make the argument that NF images may suffer from this since their resolution can still be reduced without impeding on the reader's understanding)? So, with this, I ask,
{{blockquote|A. <s>Do non-free videos fall under fair use</s> '''Do non-free files pass [[WP:NFCC#3]]?'''<BR/>. '''If not, then what makes it different to non-free images, audio, and other types of media?'''}} - [[User:Knightoftheswords281|<span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: #000000; color: #00a2ff;">Knightoftheswords</span>]] ([[User talk:Knightoftheswords281|Talk]] '''·''' [[Special:Contributions/Knightoftheswords281|Contribs]]) 19:44, 2 July 2023 (UTC)}}

On the beginning of June 8th, 2023, the state of the Northeastern university article corresponded with the following version:

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Northeastern_University&oldid=1158298335

That day, user GuardianH made a series of thirteen edits, significantly refactoring the article with extensive removals and new tags indicating the presence of academic boosterism and bias. Afterwards, the state of the article corresponded with the following version:

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Northeastern_University&oldid=1159227225


The edits have been reverted pending consensus. To resolve the ongoing dispute, I am seeking comments on:

1) Whether these proposed edits should be applied to the article.
2) Whether the tags (which are currently active) are necessary. 

I have discussed them at length with the proposer on the article talk page: [[Talk:Northeastern University#Major edits proposed by GuardianH]] and have opened a DNR on the subject here: [[Wikipedia:Dispute resolution noticeboard#Northeastern University]]

Thank you, Relativebalance. 04:28, 14 June 2023 (UTC)}}

This discussion is meant to add onto the discussion surrounding the [[Wikipedia:Five percent rule|5% rule]] for election infoboxes. This general guideline has traditionally been applied to American candidate-based elections, but more recently, RfCs have been created about parliamentary and party-based elections as well, and the general consensus has seemingly been to apply to the 5% rule to these elections ''in some form''. However, in the context of elections like the [[2021 Canadian federal election]] (more specifically, the discussion on whether or not to include the PPC in the infobox), there still seems to remain some ambiguity. For example, if a party elects 0 candidates and receives less than 5% of the popular vote, but also receives some form of "substantial" media attention or is included in debates, should the 5% rule apply? How subjective and case-by-case should the 5% rule be in the case of parliamentary elections and parties that don't elect any candidates? What "exemptions" should apply, and how should they be decided upon?

I hope that a productive discussion with a new consensus can be reached from this RfC! [[User:AwesomeSaucer9|AwesomeSaucer9]] ([[User talk:AwesomeSaucer9|talk]]) 18:15, 25 June 2023 (UTC)}}

Per the above discussion, I am opening an RfC to gather consensus on the topic of including Teller's full birth name in this article. Note the current version of the article (at the time of RfC opening) includes the full birth name of Teller.

:Should [[Teller (magician)]] include the full birth name of Teller in the article?

For one side there is enough evidence to consider "more than 24 Neveras have been sold" as confirmed by reliable sources, while the other side disagrees, stating since there has been false information in the past, Rimac could be lying and the media would just copy what they say.

Numerous welcome templates have long had a link to [[Help:Your first article]], namely
[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=insource%3A%22Help%3AYour+first+article%22+intitle%3AWelcome&title=Special:Search&profile=advanced&fulltext=1&ns10=1 these 17 templates]. It's pretty much acknowledged that writing an article is an advanced task for experienced editors (per [[Wikipedia:Task Center]], and frequent comments at the <s>[[WP:Reference desk]]</s> <u>[[WP:Help desk]]</u>, or [[WP:Tea house]]).  I think it's possible that these links are creating false hopes, getting newbies in trouble, and wasting time of helpers at the Help desk or Tea house. And even if they aren't, at a minimum they are uselessly taking up some real estate in the welcome messages that could be used for something else. I think we should drop the "your first article" links from all welcome templates that have them. Thanks, [[User:Mathglot|Mathglot]] ([[User talk:Mathglot|talk]]) 05:36, 24 June 2023 (UTC)}}

 '''

There are a several issues with the Japanese Account of Events sections, which do not line up with the scholarly consensus of the battle. 

First is the assertion that only the Imperial Navy was involved in the assault, despite Western, Chinese and Japanese scholars and accounts indicating the assault was consisted of the 3rd Division and supporting elements of the Imperial Army (and some Japanese marines too) (Sattaroshi, Harmsen, Robinson, Xie, Yuanliang, etc.). 

Second is the claim that Japanese cleared the Warehouse within ninety minutes, which is in direct contradiction with the scholarly consesus that the battle lasted more than three days (which is backed up by nearly all sources provided). The claim that the battle was over in relative ease in the early morning is a direct contradiction to the various eyewitnesses and photographs depicting combat in daytime within Sihang Warehouse (some from Robinson's photo collection). 

Third, the claim that Japanese used heavy artillery against Chinese defenders does not match the scholarly consensus of how the Japanese army refrained from using heavy artillery due to the presence of the Settlement in the area (backed by Robinson, Harmsen and Xie). 

Finally, Japanese casualty reports do not line up with the Chinese battalion roster, which accounted for 420 troops present and 387 evacuated (including wounded), which would mean that a maximum of 33 Chinese were killed in action, not 80. 

In addition with these issues, there is also the dubious origin of the sources used in the account, which mostly come from the same Japanese archive with untranslated documents without footnotes, context or references, and does not cite a larger or more diverse range of sources. 

There is also the section editor's insistence that there is a lack of secondary sources for the Japanese side of the battle, which is both untrue and kind of a dubious claim too. 

While a Japanese perspective on the event is appreciated, a whole section dealing with a minority opinion in direct contradiction to the scholarly consensus of the article (that a battle did in fact take place that lasted several days with heavy fighting in the warehouse) creates several issues, especially since most sources cited in the section stem from a single archive of dubious quality.

I request that some other editors comment on this issue too, especially given the rather disruptive manner the editor responsible for this section has been trying to get this point across (edit-warring, talk page battlegrounds, etc.). 

Thanks.

While we're on this topic, I think we should seriously consider deprecation of RationalWiki the in the same fashion we have deprecated Baidu Bake. It's an open wiki, so it automatically fails [[WP:RS]] (anyone arguing otherwise ought to be templated for disruptive editing) and [[WP:ELNO]]. One won't find a lot of links to it because I occasionally sweep the encyclopedia for inappropriate links to it (I've seen it used as a reference and as an external link), but it has been used in the reference desk (which I have left alone), and it's used as a primary source in its own article (this should include the sources that merely provide direct quotes of RationalWiki without further in-depth analysis, such as the one in the lede). RationalWiki has a history of its organization's board members spamming links to the site and then disruptively editing when these actions are challenged, making the site a candidate for the spam blacklist. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vaginal_steaming&diff=prev&oldid=789022610] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Hnedrfrieowjiahfguh#August_2017] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PCHS-NJROTC&diff=prev&oldid=795746607] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hnedrfrieowjiahfguh&diff=prev&oldid=795746764] It hosts content created by multiple users banned from Wikipedia (two of whom received WMF office bans for serious misconduct), and links to such content could be considered ban evasion. 
<br>
<br>
RationalWiki is a particularly problematic source because it is admittedly biased and extremely unstable (editor turnover is very high). [https://web.archive.org/web/20190505222250/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-jun-19-na-schlafly19-story.html Reliable sources] describe the site as one that "by their own admission engages in acts of cyber-vandalism." In the early days, it was a hang out place for trolls like [[User:Keegscee]] (who is office banned from WMF projects for harassment of Wikipedians and [https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Special:Log?type=rights&user=&page=User%3AKeegscee&wpdate=&tagfilter=&wpfilters%5B%5D=newusers maintains a sysop account in good standing there] despite users downplaying this fact because his account is inactive), and its content has slowly morphed into this strange mix of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], left wing [[Kiwi Farms]], [[Reddit]], Liberapedia, and Wikipedia. It is [https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/RationalWiki:What_is_a_RationalWiki_article%3F admittedly not encyclopedic]. For a nice example of the quality and seriousness of the project see [https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=User%3APunching+Bag the block log] and [https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=User:Punching_Bag&action=history user page history] for dummy account Punching Bag ([https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=User:Punching_Bag&diff=595844&oldid=593423 this revision advocating violence by a respected "old guard" member] is particularly lovely), [https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Goat&oldid=2543769 the Goat article] (which is in the mainspace vs. the "fun" space, potentially leading certain members of the human race such as children or people with disabilities to believe this is serious), and the [https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cunt cunt] article. [https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/RationalWiki:Sysops The bar to become a sysop on RationalWiki is extremely low], with users who have just recently joined often being granted the toolset without even asking for it (it was the first wiki I was ever an administrator on, as a matter of fact), so even the main page can be edited by pretty much anyone, much less pages about the site's history, site policies, etc. Known trolls like User:MarcusCicero and [[User:Dyskliver]] (who is office banned on WMF projects) have won moderator and board member elections and allowed to claim those titles. It historically had a policy of not permanently blocking anyone (including highly problematic trolls like [[User:Grawp]]), hence the "vandal bin" feature where people they considered annoying could still edit but were restricted to one edit every 30 minutes.
<br>
<br>
The cherry on top of all of this is that, although there is no article about me on the wiki, Dyskliver (who they finally banned for harassing other people), Oxyaena, and Bongolian have engaged in [[doxing]] by posting personal information about me on certain pages which remain on the wiki (I won't link for obvious reasons, though I will say that some of it is erroneous, and they have made some claims about me that are outright libeous). Strangely enough, despite RationalWikians attempting to downplay Keegscee's involvement in their project, the same exact information was posted on Wikipedia by Keegscee (and subsquently oversighted) in 2016, prior to it being posted on R-W by Dyskliver, Oxyaena, and Bongolian, so chances are there's still a connection even if it's in private away from public view. Dyskliver was the mastermind of this all of this, which he did in retaliation for me blocking him on Conservapedia based on solid CheckUser evidence (something RationalWiki lacks), and the rest of the community there endorsed this behavior. I understand that this aspect may be too much for this forum to consider and may require involvement of ArbCom or the WMF office, but if the source can be deprecated via this venue, there is no reason to involve them.
<br>
<br>
All of this considered, I pray that the community will consider deprecation, blacklisting, and [[WP:LINKLOVE]] treatment of RationalWiki.

'''Important.''' there are some important things you need to be aware of before replying:

* [[Ethnolinguistic group|Ethnolinguistic groups]], like [[Ethnoreligious group|ethnoreligous groups]], Are [[Ethnic groups]]. Ethnolinguistic groups share ethnicity. So when some sources say that arabs are an ethnic group, and others say arabs are ethnolinguistic group. Describing arabs as ethnolinguistic group will fulfill both sources.
* Try avoiding personal opinions and personal philosophies about what an Arab is as much as you can. If you want to falsify any of the reliable sources above then provide a reliable source that falsifies or contradicts it rather than just personal opinions.


'''goal of this rfc:''' 

describing Arabs as ethnolinguistic group rather just ethnic group in the lead of [[Arabs]] article because it is more accurate and descriptive<ref name=":0" />, and goes in agreement with a wider range of reliable sources (i.e sources that describes arabs as ethnolinguistic group and those who describe the centrality and importance of arabic language in Arab ethnic identity).

The WikiProject Banner shell has been redesigned. It now incorporates a visual identifier of the project, a shortened version of the WikiProject name, and a colour coded representation of the article class and article importance rating. The same information is presented, though with a different appearance. 

This RFC is to gain feedback on the new design. Are people happy with the new design overall? Are there improvements that could be made? Are there aspects which are felt to be unnecessary? Should the Project logos/images be shown, or just the project name? Should the class and/or importance ratings be coloured? If so, are the colours suitable? To make assessing the feedback easier, people may respond by saying '''Support all''' - '''Support all apart from images/logos''' - '''Support all apart from colour scheme''' - '''Support apart from images/logos  and colour scheme''' - '''Oppose all, except for name abbreviation''' - '''Oppose all''', or any other variation. Suggestions for improvement are most welcome. [[User:SilkTork|SilkTork]] ([[User talk:SilkTork|talk]]) 17:56, 9 July 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Starosin was undeniably a notable academic and his having an article on Wikipedia certainly seems highly warranted. That said, there does appear to be an issue in that a huge percentage of his theories have been rejected by scholarly consensus. This has lead to some issues on Wikipedia where he is heavily cited on articles which relate to his (not accepted) theories and is generally given a lot of weight as a scholar. While he undoubtably was a scholar, he nonetheless appears to be, by scholarly consensus, simply incorrect in many cases. For example:

[[Dené–Caucasian languages]] devotes an entire section to Starostin's theories

[[Northwest_Caucasian_languages#North_Caucasian_family|Nortwest Caucasian]] also devotes a paragraph to Starostin's take on it, and probably undersells that it's a take which has been rejected by most linguists.

[[Nostratic languages]] has several paragraphs dedicated to Starostin's approach to Nostratic 

[[Austric languages]] likewise dedicates a block of text to his work

[[Borean languages]] contains a fair amount of references

[[Austric languages]] contains an expansion of the theory by Starostin

All of these theories have been widely rejected by mainstream linguists, ranging from considered fringe (Nostratic) to limited but firm minority support (Altaic). To be certain, Starostin was a linguist who worked on most of these macrofamily proposals in a serious manner, and he actively contributed to the field. However, in light of their broad rejection by linguists, feels like a very substantial [[WP:UNDUE]] and [[WP:NPOV]] issue. Given he was a researcher on those theories and some are as developed as they are because of him, it does seem he warrants mentioning, but I'm definitely uncomfortable with how his theories are presented, consistently, on Wikipedia considering the reaction of the broader linguistics community. This especially is true when Starostin is cited as an authority on highly controversial topics without just how controversial they are being made clear. I've asked the Linguistics Wikiproject for comments but it seems quite inactive right now, but this does appear to be causing accuracy issues for Wikipedia, particularly in light of many of these theories undergoing a major change in acceptance throughout the 20th century, with early acceptance transitioning into later rejection as more evidence became available.

In the lead, we have RS's that Russia has 21 internationally recognized republics, plus occupied Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk, which are claimed by Russia (e.g. named in the amended Russian constitution), but which are not recognized as Russian by anyone else. (In addition, Russia does occupy all the territory it claims for Luhansk and Donetsk.) The question then is how many Russian-claimed republics that makes: 22 or 24. One source said, in a prior edition before Russia claimed Luhansk and Donetsk, that there were 21 plus Crimea, for a total of 22. That source has recently been updated to add Donetsk and Luhansk (supported also by a second source in the lead), but the total given still reads 22. The question then is whether we have to say there are 22 Russian-claimed republics, or if we should say there are 24 because 21 + 1 (Crimea) + 2 (Luhanks and Donetsk) = 24.

I wish for the last sentence as of today to be reviewed. I do not believe that the last sentence in the lead paragraph adheres to Wikipedia's standards for lead articles. Specifically, as outlined in the 'manual of style/lead section' page, it states, "Apart from basic facts, significant information should not appear..."

I attempted to edit the article to make the lead more broad, but there is a user who is actively changing it. When I left the user a warning about activist editing/war editing, and left a warning about it on their page, my user recieved a similar tag from a different user. I have requested a review of this article.

The sentence in question is, "An analysis published in 2019 found his political positions to be more conservative than almost any Democratic Legislator in California". I believe this sentence is relevant to the article, but belongs within the body of the article. This sentence is clearly designed to guide the thinking of the reader, and does not belong in the introduction as it is strangely specific.

Which of the following best describes the [[Wikipedia:RS|reliability]] of the website [https://www.publicartinpublicplaces.info Public Art in Public Places]?

*'''Option 1:''' [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources#Generally_reliable|Generally reliable]]

I'm advocating for '''Option 3''' <s>or '''Option 4'''</s>. In 2020, when [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Public Art in Public Places|a discussion led to the article on PAIPP being deleted]], the closing admin suggested that "the question of whether PAPP is a reliable, cite-able secondary source" be raised here. (At the time, there were some 80 cites. Currently [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&limit=100&offset=0&ns0=1&search=%22public+art+in+public+places%22 there are 34]). This is that. At the time, there was no discernible coverage of the organization itself.  That still appears to be the case. 

PAIPP says it collaborates with "local governments, news media, technology firms, and arts and cultural organizations" but none are named, either in the overall material or the specific references. Hence it seems to be a secondary source in which there appears to be no way to confirm where the information is coming from. PAIPP also claims "Partnerships with Google Cultural Institute, Google Maps and Google Search". Perhaps that confers reliability? I'm not sure. 

It seems to me that the information contained on the PAIPP would be better referenced sources that are more clearly vetted: mainly from the institutions that feature the art under discussion.

There's this new image of King Charles III at Wikicommons which I think would be a great replacement for his infobox. It's in good quality, it's a recent one, it depicts King Charles III and not Prince Charles like the current infobox image and (despite it not being the official portrait) looks like a formal portrait.

{{rfcquote|text=
In the beginning lead sentence of an article about a person/film/topic, should 'German' always be mentioned first before 'Nazi'? There are cases such as those in the discussion above where a Nazi Party politician's article doesn't even mention 'German' (see [[Erich Neumann (politician)|Erich Neumann]]) or instead says 'Nazi German' (see [[Hinrich Lohse]]). To cut it short the problem with this is:
*Every biographical article starts off with a nationality - that is standard Wikipedia procedure. Hence such an article should start with for example ''''Neumann was a German Nazi...'''' or ''''Neumann was a German politician of the Nazi Party''''.
*'Nazi' is not a nationality but an ideology/party, thus an article cannot just start with ''''Lohse was a Nazi German...''''. It must be ''''Lohse was a German Nazi...'''' or ''''Lohse was a German politician and war criminal of the Nazi Party''''.
*It's the same story with a film: every film starts off with a name followed by year, then nationality, and ''then'' genre. So for example ''[[Erbkrank]]'' should not start with ''''is a 1936 Nazi propaganda film'''', but change to ''''is a 1936 German 'Nazi propaganda' film''''
*Someone argued that 'German' is not necessary to have with 'Nazi' because "everyone knows it's about Germany". This is a narrow POV because not everyone from around the world will necessarily know the meaning of 'Nazi' from an western POV (The OP in the discussion above rightfully pointed out [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ#Anglo-American focus]]). Regardless this argument is null and needless as it goes directly against the standard Wikipedia format of: '''Name (DOB) > Nationality > Ideology/Genre/Topic'''.

Someone (Millscrepe) tried to amend this on [[Talk:The Eternal Jew (film)]] which was refused by someone else (Beyond My Ken) despite clear support by me and others for the proposer. The latter even made a false accusation against me above, I'm letting it slide but don't want to receive such a thing again.

The album title has been stylised in publications and is listed in retailers/on streaming as ''ANTI'', this is not an acronym, its just the word Anti written in capitals. There's a clear guide on '''all capitals''' being about stylisation. Per [[MOS:ALLCAPS]], {{tq|Avoid writing with all caps (all capital letters), including small caps (all caps at a reduced size), when they have only a stylistic function. Reduce them to title case, sentence case, or normal case, as appropriate.}} To get around this, some users have added '''(stylized in [[all caps]])''' in the starting sentence immediately after the album's title. Although this isn't word-for-word against the MOS, I think the use of the note in this way basically circumvents the Manual of Style when the "stylisation" of the title has little to - no encyclopaedic value to the topic. <span style="color:#01260d">>></span> [[User:Lil-unique1|<span style="color:#01260d">'''Lil-unique1'''</span>]] <span style="color:#01260d">'''('''</span>[[User talk:Lil-unique1|<span style="color:#08752d">'''talk'''</span>]]<span style="color:#01260d">''')'''</span> — 19:50, 21 July 2023 (UTC)}}

<blockquote>Heather Baron-Gracie has also collaborated with other artists on various projects. She co-wrote and sang on [[The 1975]]'s song "[[TooTimeTooTimeTooTime|TOOTIMETOOTIMETOOTIME]]", which was a top 40 hit in the UK. ... Furthermore, she has written songs for other artists, such as Olivia Rodrigo’s [[Deja Vu (Olivia Rodrigo song)|Deja Vu]]" and [[Billie Eilish]]'s "[[Happier Than Ever (song)|Happier Than Ever]]".</blockquote>

What "negative" aspects of the United States should be added into the lead of the article?

* Several states lacking abortion (or other reproductive rights) compared to other developed countries
* Retention of the death penalty compared to other developed countries
* Lack of paid family lead
* Higher levels of inequality and incarceration than most developed nations. (The United States has an exceptional incarceration rate from an international perspective; its Gini is "medium") 

Personally, I believe that only incarceration should be mentioned. There's been back and forth on this for awhile. (Dating back to two years ago.) And I think it is best that a consensus on all of this is reached through a RFC.

The current advice is poorly worded and potentially creates more issues than it solves.

The specific line in question is this: "{{tq|GBP, sterling's ISO 4217 code, should be used to disambiguate that currency from others. Avoid using stg. or GB£.}}"

This is unclear and gives no aid to helping resolve problems comparing with currencies that never had ISO currency codes. It has resulted in some strange anomalies like in this diff[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irish_pound&diff=prev&oldid=1169688225]; where an ISO code was crowbarred into a sentence about the early 18th century, prior to the existence of the United Kingdom or even the Kingdom of Great Britain. This has since been corrected, but I feel we should have more categorical advice in such circumstances.

My proposal is that this line be rewritten as this:
*{{tq|Do not append {{xt|£}} with abbreviations or codes ({{!xt|£123 STG}} or {{!xt|£123 GBP}}), in the vast majority of circumstances a simple pound sign alone will suffice to denote sterling. In those cases where disambiguation is absolutely necessary (for example if comparing with the historical [[Irish pound|Irish]] or [[South African pound|South African]] pounds) qualify with the full word "sterling" ({{xt|£123 sterling}}){{efn|The same methodology should be applied to the Irish, South African, Australian, and New Zealand pounds; {{xt|£123 Irish}}, {{xt|£123 South African}}, {{xt|£123 Australian}}, {{xt|£123 New Zealand}}, unless the context is specific to that country, in which case a simple pound sign may be used.}}}}

Since there are many opinions for following one of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Ukrainian#Tables_of_romanization_systems existing standards for general romanization of Ukrainian], I suggest to switch from the 2010 Ukrainian national standard to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071219022912if_/http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/Romanization/Romanization_Ukrainian.pdf BGN/PCGN 1965 standard], for the following reasons:

1. The BGN/PCGN 1965 transcription is generally more correctly pronounced by English speakers, which is its main advantage and should be the most important argument/criterion in choosing a romanization standard for use in English context.

2. The BGN/PCGN 1965 transcription is more suitable for use in English and more typical for English as it employs the English spelling system, unlike the 2010 Ukrainian national standard.

3. The BGN/PCGN 1965 transcription is more unambiguous and reversible.

4. The BGN/PCGN 1965 standard is consistent (in the transcription of iotated vowels and ''й'') and simple, unlike the 2010 Ukrainian national standard.

5. The BGN/PCGN 1965 Ukrainian romanization standard is harmonized (regarding the transcription of iotated vowels and ''й'') with the current BGN/PCGN romanization standards for [https://geonames.nga.mil/geonames/GNSSearch/GNSDocs/romanization/ROMANIZATION_OF_RUSSIAN.pdf Russian] and [https://geonames.nga.mil/geonames/GNSSearch/GNSDocs/romanization/ROMANIZATION_OF_BELARUSIAN.pdf Belarusian], which are used in the English Wikipedia (with some modifications). Ukrainian shares with Russian and Belarusian a lot of personal names, some surnames and other names and words, and their transcription should not differ depending on the origin or country of residence of a name holder.

It is worth noting that the BGN/PCGN 1965 standard is preferred by ''Britannica'' and has comparable popularity in English as the 2010 Ukrainian national standard (the BGN/PCGN 1965 transcription is more common for Ukrainian personal names, about as common for Ukrainian surnames, yet less common for Ukrainian place names).

For comparison:

''Надія, Касьян, Тетяна, Таїса, Макіївка, Мар’їнка, Таврійськ, Андрій, Зеленський''

''Nadiya, Kasyan, Tetyana, Tayisa, Makiyivka, Maryinka, Tavriysk, Andriy, Zelenskyy'' (BGN/PCGN 1965 standard)

''Nadiia, Kasian, Tetiana, Taisa, Makiivka, Marinka, Tavriisk, Andrii, Zelenskyi'' (2010 Ukrainian national standard, currently a guideline in the Manual of Style)

I'd like to reopen the discussion about how to present Mr. Polanski's child sex abuse conviction and whether to include a mention of it in the opening paragraph or opening sentence. It has been several years since it was last discussed. I have previously suggested something like "Raymond Roman Thierry Polański (né Liebling; 18 August 1933) is a French and Polish film director, producer, screenwriter, actor, and convicted child sexual abuser.", along the same lines as the opening sentences in the [[Harvey Weinstein]] and [[Jeffrey Epstein]] articles.

{{rfcquote|text=
Hello, recently during Gamescom Netflix revealed the title of first two parts of ''Rebel Moon'' as "A Child of Fire" and "Scargiver". User InfiniteNexus changed the title back to ''Rebel Moon'' from ''Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire'', insisting that it's only a marketing/onscreen title and not an official one. However ''Rebel Moon'' is the title of the whole story divided into two parts. It's also being called a film in itself despite being divided into two parts [https://deadline.com/2023/06/rebel-moon-a-two-part-film-says-zack-snyder-two-cuts-to-be-released-per-part-1235409564/].

The recent Netflix release makes this clear: {{tq|Start your hunt into the mysteries of Rebel Moon when Part 1, titled Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire, lands on Dec. 22. Rebel Moon Part Two: The Scargiver will follow very soon after, streaming on Netflix on April 19, 2024.}} [https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/rebel-moon-release-date-photos].

The Gamescom trailer on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rHLOXbFZtI YouTube] clearly says "Part 1: A Child of Fire" releases on December 22, 2023 and "Part 2: Scargiver" on April 18, 2024.

Virtually every evidence InfiniteNexus has used to claim the official title is ''Rebel Moon'' is either before Gamescom or he's misunderstanding that it's using ''Rebel Moon'' for the film divided into two parts. But we even if we don't create articles for separate parts of the same film story, we never use the title of the whole story of multiple parts for a single part. You wouldn't call ''Batman: The Dark Knight Returns - Part 1'' as ''Batman: The Dark Knight Returns''.

So I suggest this article either be only for the first part and the title ''Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire'' be restored, or this article represent both the parts and not just the first one (at least until the second part can be considered notable enough to get its own article).

Other sources suggest that the victims are gender neutral. But this article does not include any information on the scientific debate on gender symmetry. Should the article both views on the debate? Remove the "overwhelming"?

This idea is known as gender symmetry. There is a lot of debate among scholars about whether the genders are both victimised similarly. To me it seems to be a violation of [[WP:NPOV]] for the article to completely omit the fact that it is under debate. See [[Domestic violence against men#Gender symmetry]] and [[Intimate partner violence#Gender symmetry]].

One of the sources is a [[literature review]] of 1,700 studies on domestic violence, and it suggested that the genders are equal. Completely ignoring this perspective is a massive [[WP:NPOV]] violation.

Apologies for having seperate threads, I wasn't aware about how RfC is supposed to be formatted.

{{rfcquote|text=
As previously mentioned in the [[Talk:Defense of Sihang Warehouse#Factual accuracy and neutrality|Talk:Defense of Sihang Warehouse#Factual accuracy and neutrality]], @[[User:KresyRise|KresyRise]] has added a number of claims with citations that are either irrelevant or do not support what they have written. I had added tags to dispute these questionable citations but they were promptly removed by the user. There is also an issue with the user asserting western sources support the Chinese account of events without providing citations of such (perhaps they are confusing English-language sources using Chinese primary and secondary sources as "western sources"), and removing passages from the Japanese account of events. In an effort to avoid further edit-warring, I would like a comment from a third party on what measures should be taken.

Thank You,

This policy is almost as old as the project, but it no longer reflects editing practice. It also causes vast amounts of drama at AfD. Consider the areas where some Wikipedians have zealously advocated for categorical inclusion, or "inherent notability":
* Census designated places
* Highways
* Railway stations
* Schools
* Olympic athletes
We have had fights over whether categories can be included or deleted (e.g. SMALLCAT) where the limit on size is largely imposed by this policy. We have had people who have been banned multiple times with sometimes dozens of sockpuppets because they refuse to accept this policy (e.g. Sander.v.Ginkel). Few things are more guaranteed to cause an inclusionist / deletionist fight than an essentially unsourceable article about something that nevertheless is needed to make a directory complete. Of course this is partly because lists don't self-maintain, and summary text minor entries can't be included in categories without an article - and individuals have preferences for lists v. categories for sound reasons in both cases.

At the very least we need to acknowledge that Wikipedia ''is'' a directory of some things. We can argue until we're blue in the face about dropping sourcing standards to allow inclusion, but the entire drama seems unnecessary if we simply bow to the inevitable here.

A ''Cauchy sequence'' is also called a ''fundamental sequence''.

{{rfcquote|text=
I propose to improve the opening paragraph of the article to:

"'''''Millennials, also known as Generation Y or Gen Y, are the demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z. There are no precise or set definitions although researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years. It has been argued that millennials are typically defined as the generation born between 1981 to 1996, although 1980 has also been used as the earliest starting birth year.'''''"

A couple of people here have suggested that 1981 is the 'widely' accepted starting birth year and the lede should not contain any reference to 1980 at all. They cite two sources to support this case (<ref name="Rauch">{{cite news|url=https://worldin2019.economist.com/millennialsvboomers|title=Generation next, Millennials will outnumber baby-boomers in 2019|last1=Rauch|first1=Jonathan|date=November 2018|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=13 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315052954/https://worldin2019.economist.com/millennialsvboomers|archive-date=15 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Millennials cheer New Zealand lawmaker's "OK, Boomer" remark|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-newzealand-millennials/millennials-cheer-new-zealand-lawmakers-ok-boomer-remark-idUSKBN1XG2YT|date=6 November 2019|publisher=Reuters}}</ref>). Only one of these sources supports this assertion while the other is out of date and not in support of this assertion in any case. There are countless examples of 1980 now being used as the starting year and it does not stand up to scrutiny that 1980 should be excluded from the lede. In any case, the article actually explicitly references 1980 as an alternative starting birth year within the "Date and age range definitions" section.

I propose to improve and clarify the lede based on the latest information and information already covered within the article. Therefore, making it more encyclopedic.[[User:Richie wright1980|Richie wright1980]] ([[User talk:Richie wright1980|talk]]) 00:07, 7 August 2023 (UTC)}}

It seems the [[Japanese Wikipedia]]'s [[:ja:バーベンハイマー#日本の反応|バーベンハイマー#日本の反応]] has more texts than what this article's "[[Barbenheimer#Japanese response|Japanese response]]" section currently does, so why not incorporate more content from there? But before we go, there are some things to consider. On one hand, as the only country to be attacked by nuclear weapons, the use of [[mushroom cloud]] image as a humour or in a lighthearted context is considered to be inappropriate in Japan. On the other hand (and correct me if I'm wrong), most of Japanese people are not sufficiently educated about any wrong doings of the [[Empire of Japan]] and [[Imperial Japanese Armed Forces|its armed forces]] during their existence, and especially the [[World War II|Second World War]], which led to the droppings of the bombs by the United States in the first place.<sup>1</sup> Additionally, at the time the social media controversy arose, the contemporary [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] was considering whether or not (or rather, when) to [[Discharge of radioactive water of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant#Discharge to ocean, treated water|dump the radioactive wastewater from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster into the Pacific Ocean]]. Hope these add much to the context.

By the way, I'd like to recommend everyone to read ''[[Barefoot Gen]]'', which criticises both the war crimes of Imperial Japan, and America's dropping of atomic bombs.

:<sup>1</sup> But let's not cite some non-notable sources {{diff|Barbenheimer|prev|1169139757|like last time}}.

How should national football team articles be titled?

It has been mentioned a few times now that a wider discussion is needed regarding the naming convention for national football teams with regards to the inclusion of gender (see [[Talk:Sweden men's national football team#Requested move 27 July 2023|here]], [[Talk:Scotland national football team#Requested move 12 April 2023|here]] and [[Talk:Australia men's national soccer team/Archive 7#Requested move 24 December 2021|here]] for more info) and I feel this is more appropriate than a massive RM involving 200+ articles. It also allows more easily for flexibility if there are differing consensus across countries. I've tried to keep the question as neutral as I can but I would like to hear opinions on how consistent the use of gender in article titles should be and what editors should consider before moving a page.

A [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_California_hurricanes&diff=prev&oldid=1175225496 recent IP comment] made a valid point about the nomenclature used for this list's title. I initiated this RfC in order to determine whether consensus exists to rename this list.

Options:

* 1: '''List of California hurricanes, tropical storms, and depressions'''
**'''Pro''':
***Current name is misleading because records only confirm that one hurricane has ever passed through California.
***All others listed systems were tropical storms, depressions, or remnants thereof.
**'''Con''':
***Complicated name.
***Study of the [https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/chenowethlandsea.pdf AMS paper that reported] the discovery of the [[1858 San Diego hurricane|one hurricane to make landfall in California]] suggests that its conclusion may have been reached by educated guessing rather than firm evidence.

* 2: '''List of California hurricane remnants'''
**'''Pro''':
***Concisely sums up the various tropical storms, depressions, etc. listed.
***Makes clear that listed weather phenomena were not hurricanes upon making landfall in California.
**'''Con''':
***Unfamiliar name.
***Some listed systems were remnants of tropical storms and depressions.
***Needs an explanatory note in the lead or elsewhere in the list explaining that the [[American Meteorological Society|AMS]] reported on the recorded existence of one hurricane in 1858. 

* 3: '''Maintain current name'''
**'''Pro''':
***Familiarity.
***Most of these listed weather phenomena had originated as hurricanes prior to making landfall in California, which for a wider audience may qualify as a "California hurricane".
**'''Con''':
***Misleading name.
***Only one listed storm qualifies as being a hurricane.

Is it appropriate for the academic theory, “Polyvagal Theory” to be characterized as “unproven” in the lead? Here’s the sentence:
 '''Polyvagal theory''' (''poly-'' "many" + ''vagal'' "wandering") is a collection of unproven, evolutionary, neuroscientific, and psychological constructs pertaining to the role of the [[vagus nerve]] in emotion regulation, social connection and fear response, introduced in 1994 by [[Stephen Porges]]. 

*Yes, the characterization as “unproven” should remain in the lead.

*In part. Different language should be used in the lead to reflect criticism of the theory from the body of the article.

*No, the characterization should be removed.

This article has been problematic for twelve years. Initially it had the scope of our current [[Patience (game)]] article. In 2011 an editor without consensus split content from here to create the Patience article, leaving a dictionary definition article stub at this title.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASolitaire&diff=413063745&oldid=365867969][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solitaire&diff=413096394&oldid=407687494][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Patience_(game)&oldid=413061972] Since then there have been various attempts to fix it through discussion, notably [[Talk:Patience (game)#Requested move 4 March 2018|in 2018]], [[Talk:Solitaire_(disambiguation)#Requested_move_7_December_2019|in 2019]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Solitaire|in 2023]], all of which failed. 

In this context, please comment on what the right scope for this article should be. Discussion so far (above) has been stuck between three editors with differing views: one who thinks the scope is "games called solitaire", one who thinks it is "all one-player tabletop games", and me who thinks it is currently about the term solitaire and thus should be at wiktionary. Note that after two months of discussion, no sources have yet been brought to adequately cover any of these three potential scopes, so editors bringing sources with their comments would be greatly appreciated.

Previous consensus [[Talk:Tiffany Young/Archive 1#American vs Korean-American?|here]] was in favor of including her ethnicity in the lead section mainly due to relevant to the subject's notability. However, as of today, we have yet another dilemma where another group of editors (whom didn't participated previously) were in favor of removing it hence we need to fix it once and for all (this can't kept going on where more than 6 months later, another group wanted it back) and agree on what is what, lets !vote.

Which options is your preferred !vote:

Dear Editors of the HIStory World Tour,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently reviewed the information related to the HIStory World Tour and came across a minor error, particularly in the section detailing the tour dates. I would like to propose a correction to ensure the accuracy of our records. In the tour dates section, it is mentioned that Michael Jackson visited "Taiwan" during his Asian tour. While he did indeed perform there, it is important to note that, according to the general consensus of the international community, Taiwan is not an independent country. Therefore, I suggest amending "Taiwan" to "People's Republic of China" to accurately reflect this fact. I understand that many sources on the internet may refer to Taiwan due to their focus on the performance location rather than geopolitical issues. Additionally, given certain Western influences attempting to divide China, some malicious media outlets may intentionally refer to Taiwan as an independent country. However, as a free and open wiki website, we have a responsibility to ensure the accuracy of information and inform people that Michael Jackson visited what is officially recognized as Chinese Taiwan. I can provide numerous reputable sources, including official statements from the United States government and relevant United Nations documents, to support the assertion that Taiwan is an integral part of China. These sources explicitly state that Taiwan is a province of China. I appreciate your dedicated work and hope that this suggestion will help ensure the accuracy of our tour information. If further discussion or assistance is needed, please do not hesitate to contact me.  
:He did perform in Taiwan though, and there are multiple sources that say that "he performed in Taiwan", like these sources [https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Michael_Jackson_FAQ/BKlZCwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=michael+jackson+taiwan+1996&pg=PT433&printsec=frontcover here], [https://books.google.ca/books?id=kDgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62&dq=michael+jackson+taiwan+1996+history&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi27bbU48yBAxXjvokEHfgPDbcQ6AF6BAgFEAI#v=onepage&q=michael%20jackson%20taiwan%201996%20history&f=false here] and [https://books.google.ca/books?id=FGYVAAAAIBAJ&pg=PA27&dq=michael+jackson+taiwan+1996+history&article_id=1675,3618942&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj00Lzq48yBAxVZjYkEHdRcBCEQ6AF6BAgNEAI#v=onepage&q=michael%20jackson%20taiwan%201996%20history&f=false here].

The old lead is full of problems, the primary one being its non-accessibility to the average reader, overuse of technical jargon, and trying to define a concept differently defined by different traditions, calling it "fuzzy". I propose to replace it with:

{{quote|'''Nondualism''' includes a number of philosophical and spiritual traditions that emphasize the absence of fundamental duality or separation in existence.{{sfn|Loy|1997|pp=178, 185}} This viewpoint questions the boundaries conventionally imposed between self and other, mind and body, observer and observed,{{sfn|Loy|1997}} and other dichotomies that shape our perception of reality. As a field of study, nondualism delves into the concept of '''nonduality'''{{sfn|Loy|1997}} and the state of '''nondual awareness''',{{sfn|Hanley|Nakamura|Garland|2018}}{{sfn|Josipovic|2019}} encompassing a diverse array of interpretations across traditions, not limited to a particular cultural or religious context; instead, nondualism emerges as a central teaching across various traditions, inviting individuals to examine reality beyond the confines of dualistic thinking.

What sets nondualism apart is its inclination towards [[direct experience]] as a path to [[understanding]]. While [[Intellectualism|intellectual comprehension]] has its place, nondual traditions emphasize the [[Spiritual transformation|transformative power]] of firsthand encounters with the underlying unity of existence. Through practices like [[meditation]] and self-inquiry, practitioners aim to bypass the limitations of [[Conceptual model|conceptual understanding]] and directly apprehend the interconnectedness that transcends superficial distinctions.{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=15}} This experiential aspect of nondualism challenges the limitations of [[language]] and [[rational thought]], aiming for a more immediate, [[Intuition|intuitive]] form of knowledge.

Nondualism is distinct from [[monism]],<ref>Roberts, M. V. (2010). ''Dualities: A Theology of Difference''. Presbyterian Publishing Corporation. {{isbn|9780664234492}}. p. 21. Discusses why Advaita Vedanta is nondual while Kashmir Shaivism is monist.</ref> another philosophical concept that deals with the [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] of [[reality]]. While both philosophies challenge the conventional understanding of dualism, they approach it differently. Nondualism emphasizes unity amid diversity. In contrast, monism posits that reality is ultimately [[symbol grounding problem|grounded]] in a [[Monad (philosophy)|singular substance or principle]], reducing the multiplicity of existence to a singular foundation. The distinction lies in their approach to the relationship between the [[Neither one nor many|many and the one]].<ref>Bowes, P. (2021). ''The Hindu Religious Tradition: A Philosophical Approach''. Taylor & Francis. {{ISBN|9781000216097}} "There is a subtle difference in philosophical implications of these two terms 'monism' and 'non-dualism'. 'Monism' may be thought to have a numerical implication, one as against the many, and here unity may appear to be numerical. 'Non-dualism' has no numerical implication, things are not different from one another, or not two, from the point of view of seeing the divine essence present in all things, but their numerical manyness need not be in question in any way. The Upanisads concern themselves with the non-dual divine essence of the universe, but they in no way reject the numerical manyness in order to preach non-dualism."</ref>

Each nondual tradition presents unique interpretations of nonduality. [[Advaita Vedanta]], a school of thought within [[Hinduism]], focuses on the realization of the unity between the individual self ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]) and the ultimate reality ([[Brahman]]).{{sfn|Loy|2012|p=17}} In [[Zen Buddhism]], the emphasis is on the direct experience of interconnectedness that goes beyond conventional thought constructs. [[Dzogchen]], found in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], highlights the recognition of an innate nature free from dualistic limitations.{{sfnp|McCagney|1997|pp=40–41}} This diversity of perspectives reflects the richness of nondualism, which transcends binary perceptions and offers unique insights into the fundamental nature of reality.}}

This is a much more accessible lead, easier to understand for the average reader, distinguishes and nondualism from monism, which the current article fails to do. [[User:Skyerise|Skyerise]] ([[User talk:Skyerise|talk]]) 00:16, 30 August 2023 (UTC)}}

[[La Izquierda Diario]] ("'The left' newspaper) is an online newspaper from Argentina. It is owned by the [[Socialist Workers' Party (Argentina)|Socialist Workers' Party]], and as such it is a [[WP:BIASED|biased source]]. We may still use it with attribution, but to what end? This is a really minor and almost irrelevant party. It is part of the [[Workers' Left Front]] coalition ("Frente de Izquierda y de trabajadores"), which only got 2.65% of the vote on the last elections (see [https://resultados.gob.ar/elecciones/1/0/1/-1/-1 here]). Their opinions are hardly relevant for any article, except those about themselves. Note that the article says "La Izquierda Diario has been credited for gaining a non-Trotskyite reader base among the left.", but the reference is not really a good one: it is a magazine detailing the profile of one of their own columnists, who happens to work at that other newspaper as well. If we check independent sources, [https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2022/06/14/cuales-son-los-medios-que-mas-se-consumen-en-la-argentina/ here] is a report of the most consumed media in Argentina, including online media. It lists the top 16 ones, and La Izquierda Diario is not even mentioned. It does not have any noticeable reader base, Trotskyite or otherwise. 

In short, this newspaper '''belongs''' to a political party, which makes it a biased source by default (and you can always read any random article to confirm their left-wing bias), and that party is of borderline significance. I request to consider it "''Generally unreliable''" in articles about politics of Argentina. [[User:Cambalachero|Cambalachero]] ([[User talk:Cambalachero|talk]]) 18:12, 26 September 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The article mentions a massacre orchestrated by the Poles during the Moscow Uprising of 1611, with an estimated casualty figure of 6-7 thousand Muscovites. 

This information is sourced from an article on press.lv, which states: 'По подсчетам современных историков, во время восстания погибли примерно 7 тыс. горожан.' ('According to the calculations of modern historians, about 7 thousand citizens died during the uprising.'). 

However, the referenced article does not provide a link to any research by historians substantiating this figure. 

Moreover, the press.lv article is a re-publication of another piece from aif.ru titled 'Московская резня 1611 г. Как впервые была сказана фраза «шапками закидаем»' ('The Moscow Massacre of 1611. When was the phrase 'we will throw hats on' first said'). The aif.ru article, too, lacks reference to any research, and its author (profile: <nowiki>https://aif.ru/opinion/author/358</nowiki>) is not a historian. 

Hence, the casualty figure of 6-7 thousand cited in the article remains unverified, and the source appears to be of low credibility.

Does this content in the quote belong to the "Connection to the Palestinian issue" section?

I am unaware of any Wikipedia guidelines that prevent the addition of findings by leading human rights organizations. Furthermore, articles about protests in Wikipedia are quite exhuastive, including [[George Floyd protests]], which has dedicated sections for conspiracy theories, public art, and economic impact. 
{{cquote|On 13 September 2023, [[Amnesty International]] published an article arguing that Israel's judicial overhaul has "alarming" implications for human rights, especially for Palestinians. It stated that Israel's judiciary, mainly its Supreme Court, has regularly upheld policies, practices and laws that helped enforce "Israel's system of apartheid against Palestinians". The article named examples of the role the Supreme Court played against Palestinians: upholding administrative detentions, green-lighting the destruction of villages, upholding a law imposing restrictions on family reunification. Amnesty argued that the Supreme Court intervened in protecting Palestinian human rights on few occasions, but if the institution loses power to the government, even this "slim and inconsistent" protection would disappear.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/09/defending-the-rule-of-law-enforcing-apartheid-the-double-life-of-israels-judiciary/|title=Defending the rule of law, enforcing apartheid – the double life of Israel’s judiciary|work=Amnesty International|date=13 September 2023|accessdate=23 September 2023}}</ref>}} [[User:Makeandtoss|Makeandtoss]] ([[User talk:Makeandtoss|talk]]) 13:50, 25 September 2023 (UTC)}}

For over a decade now the titles of articles about British monarchs have been at [[Elizabeth II]], [[George VI]], [[Edward VIII]], etc. Likewise it has been 13 years since [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] was moved to [[Maria Theresa]] <small>([[Talk:Maria_Theresa/Archive_1#Requested_move_2|discussion]])</small> and [[Louis-Philippe I of France]] to [[Louis-Philippe I]] <small>([[Talk:Louis_Philippe_I/Archive_1#Requested_move|discussion]])</small>, longer still since [[Napoleon I of France]] was abandoned for [[Napoleon]]. Three years ago the country qualifiers were dropped for titles such as [[Juan Carlos I]] and others <small>([[Talk:Amadeo_I_of_Spain#Requested_move_20_August_2020|discussion]])</small>, [[Carl XVI Gustaf]] and others <small>([[Talk:Carl_XVI_Gustaf/Archive_2#Requested_move_9_June_2020|discussion]])</small>, [[Elizabeth I]] <small>([[Talk:Elizabeth_I/Archive_4#Requested_move_25_May_2020|discussion]])</small> and others, [[Louis XIV]] and others <small>([[Talk:Louis_XIV/Archive_3#Requested_move_21_June_2020|discussion]])</small>, etc.

This year multiple attempts to move articles back to the Name Number of Country format failed: [[Alfonso XIII]] to [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]] and similar <small>([[Talk:Alfonso_XII#Requested_move_30_March_2023|discussion]])</small>, [[Napoleon III]] to [[Napoleon III of France]] and similar <small>([[Talk:Charles_the_Bald#Requested_move_31_July_2023|discussion]])</small>,  [[Elizabeth II]] to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] and similar <small>([[Talk:Elizabeth_II/Archive_48#Requested_move_30_July_2023|discussion]])</small>

 Requesting separate objective input on the following question: does ''Phytotherapy Research'' meet Wikipedia standards for reliability? It is a peer-reviewed journal with an impact factor of 6.338. By user Ashwinr, 8 October 2023.
:That information does not address the issue discussed above: ''Phytotherapy Research'' is not a reliable source <u>for medical content</u>, as it meets no [[WP:MEDRS]] standards - see [[WP:MEDASSESS]] pyramids for the quality of evidence needed to support medical content. High-quality reviews of [[Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_III|Phase III clinical trials]] do not appear in ''Phytotherapy Research'' because there are no such trials on ''W. somnifera'' to review - the existing trials are all rudimentary and low-quality with design and compliance problems, as commonly mentioned by the authors. ''Phytotherapy Research'' publications do not guide national clinical organizations for their recommendations about using ''W. somnifera'' for treating any supposed medical disorder (because no such recommendations exist), and do not influence national regulatory agencies about approving ''W. somnifera'' as a drug (''W. somnifera'' is not approved for treating anything). An acceptable source would be  "medical guidelines or position statements by internationally or nationally recognized expert bodies also often contain recommendations, along with assessments of underlying evidence" (from MEDASSESS) or a Cochrane review.
:The concluson is that ''Phytotherapy Research'' publications on ''W. somnifera'' are preliminary at best, and too low-quality to imply an effect on any physiological mechanism or clinical disorder. [[User:Zefr|Zefr]] ([[User talk:Zefr|talk]]) 04:25, 8 October 2023 (UTC)}}

Regarding the section "[[WP:GEOLAND|Settlements and administrative regions]]" of the notability guide for geographical features ([[WP:NGEO]]), which of the following should we do?:
* '''Option 1''': Status quo. Leave it as it is
* '''Option 2''': Replace the "Settlements and administrative regions" section with:
::'''Settlements''' and '''administrative regions''' are typically presumed notable, provided information about them beyond statistics, region, and coordinates is [[WP:BURDEN|known to exist]]. The extent of coverage in secondary sources should be considered to ensure there is enough verifiable content for an encyclopedic article. Editors should avoid creating very short articles on these topics, e.g., "Village X is in County Y, Province Z of Country A, at coordinates C, with a population of P." is not enough content for a stand-alone article.

::If a Wikipedia article on a settlement or [[administrative region]] cannot be developed using known sources, information on it should instead be included in a more general article on a higher-level administrative region, or in a list article collecting information on similar settlements or regions (per the [[WP:NLIST|list notability criteria]] and [[Wikipedia:Stand-alone lists#all not notable|common list selection criteria #2]]). 

::This criterion applies to settlements and administrative regions including states, provinces, municipalities, districts, parishes, counties,  cities, villages, towns, and their equivalents, that provide general-purpose administration for their region, regardless of whether they presently exist or [[WP:NTEMP|are abandoned]], even if their population is low. It does not apply to special-purpose districts such as census tracts, irrigation districts, library districts, etc. which should instead be assessed on a case-by-case basis according to the [[general notability guideline]].
:This change to be made in combination with the amonishment that editors should avoid flooding AFD with articles (e.g., more than 10 nominations  per day as with [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability_(astronomical_objects)/Archive_4#Proposed_changes|minor planets]]) that fail the amended guide.

Should the term "'''most points in Ballon d Or history''' used in the article or there is consensus that there are no reliable sources on that and it is just original research intepretation of some journalist? While it is no surprise many IP or rare users add trivial stats to articles about Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi then I was shocked when [[User:PeeJay]] (experienced editor) restored this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ballon_d%27Or&diff=prev&oldid=1165974995 thing]. Khelnow.com is not reliable source an that [https://khelnow.com/football/top-10-players-most-ballon-dor-votes-in-history system of points] does not make any sense. France football never make any officlal list of most points in history but if new term "most Ballon d r points in history" has been introduced then Messi would have more points than Cristiano Ronaldo and Johan Cruyff would have more than Modric. Back then there were much less !voters in that, although players could achieve certain places then they did not receive a lot of points: [https://twitter.com/avisualgame/status/1607776382490222593 that is the problem]. As France Football (or any other organisation as UEFFA or at least other reliable source) never published rnking with proper analyse there is no need to add such [[WP:NOTSTATS]]. Additionally it is featured article so that not reliable fake information about most points in history could butcher and disgrace the article. It does not make any sense if for [[1956 Ballon d'Or]] first place holder had 47 points and for [[2021 Ballon d'Or]] 9-th place holder had 58 points, in [[2014 FIFA Ballon d'Or]] as points were "percentages, meanwhile in [[2022 Ballon d'Or]] points were hidden, etc., so total mix up and, so big disapointed that not verifited thing was ever added to Wikipedia and yet resorted.

There's a disbute on wether this article should be moved to "Al Ahli Arab Hospital massacre".I think it should be moved because there are already multiple articles on 2023 Israel–Hamas war titled "massacre" where the casualities are Israelies such as [[Ein HaShlosha massacre]] and [[Kfar Aza massacre]], so why this article shouldn't be called a massacre? Whether the perpetrators are Israelies or Hamas, it won't change the fact that this is a massacre. [[User:Super ninja2|☆SuperNinja2☆]] 20:27, 17 October 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I wonder why is it this much normalized to consider a racist name as an alternative name for Persian Gulf. Persian Gulf is an international body of water and is not a part of Iranian territory. So, when it is called by its standard name, there is no racial meaning in this context. it's not even related to Iran. It's simply a name.
But when you call it Arabian, it is no more a simple name. you are giving it a racial meaning.
Let me make another example: Consider the Indian Ocean. While we call it the Indian Ocean, it's simply a name with no racial context. but what if we call it "Iranian Ocean"? Aren't we giving it racial meaning in this way? Doesn't it mean we are expressing hate against Indians? The ocean is right there as an international water and is not a part of Indian territory and its name presents no racial meaning, But if we call it Iranian, then it will be different.

So I am saying.. there is no middle ground here. You can not say I will respect both sides. You are either using a simple name that is not related to Iranians or any other race  OR you are a racist and a pro Pan-Arabism who is expressing hate against Iranians. So, using 'argumentum ad temperantiam' here means you are the latter. That's it. 

Using a racist alternative for the name of Persian Gulf would be against the neutral view policy of Wikipedia. The only neutral name here is Persian Gulf.
The 'Arabian' name is not simply incorrect. It's not neutral. The racist name  as an alternative should be removed, as we wouldn't use n-word as alternative for black although its use is prevalent. The modern naming dispute can be instead described in a separate section inside the article.[[User:Amirmm0|Amirmm0]] ([[User talk:Amirmm0|talk]]) 11:29, 21 October 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Starting over the previous discussion with (hopefully) more participants.

I'll restate the issue: currently the page begins this way:

{{Blockquote
|'''Hanlon's razor''' is an [[adage]] or [[rule of thumb]] that states:
: "Never attribute to [[Bad faith|malice]] that which is adequately explained by stupidity."
}}
This formulation of the adage is a direct quote from a book by Robert Bloch, not Robert Hanlon, though it's widely accepted that Bloch used the adage with Hanlon's permission. 

My problem with this is that it treats Bloch's book as the official version of an adage that had already been around for a while. It didn't even get called "Hanlon's Razor" until it appeared in the [[Jargon File]]. Now, it's a good way to formulate the adage, but we shouldn't treat it as ''the'' formulation. So I want to make a minor change:

{{Blockquote
|'''Hanlon's razor''' is an [[adage]] or [[rule of thumb]] that, in a typical formulation, states: "Never attribute to [[Bad faith|malice]] that which is adequately explained by stupidity."}}

As you can see from the previous section, a couple of other editors disagree. [[User:Isaac Rabinovitch|Isaac Rabinovitch]] ([[User talk:Isaac Rabinovitch|talk]]) 17:43, 25 October 2023 (UTC)}}

We all know how Wikipedia works. In this case, historical figures must be presented in time context. As for Christopher Columbus, he did not live during the existence of Italy. One RS also talks about this. Given that mention of Italy is an anachronism, I suggest using information from several RS in which Christopher Columbus is presented as Genoese.
Sources that say Christopher Columbus was an Genoese explorer are:
*J.R. LeMaster, ‎Donald D. Kummings (2013) The Routledge Encyclopedia of Walt Whitman, p. 139.
*Jon Cowans (2003) Early Modern Spain: A Documentary History.  University of Pennsylvania Press. p. 28
*Médar Serrata (2022) The True and Only Bones of Columbus”: Relics, Archives, and Reversed Scenarios of Discovery. Cambridge University Press. p. 476
*Ernle Bradford (2014) Christopher Columbus. Open Road Media. p.139
*Paul Strathern (2023) The Other Renaissance: From Copernicus to Shakespeare: How the Renaissance in Northern Europe Transformed the World.
*Lawrence A. Clayton (2012) Bartolomé de las Casas: A Biography. p. 10.

Based on the above, I ask interested editors whether the introductory part should be harmonized with more RS and instead of information that ”Christopher Columbus was an Italian explorer” be changed to ”Christopher Columbus was an Genoese explorer”

{{Ping|Oshwah}} Is this Rfc still valid [[Talk:Christopher_Columbus/Archive_17#RFC:_on_qualifier_Italian_in_Christopher_Columbus_lead]] and can we officially end this issue here if it is not the same question(this Rfc)?

I would invite everyone from the previous Rfc to specifically state here whether or not you are in favor to change information from the introductory part: ”Christopher Columbus was an Italian explorer” to ”Christopher Columbus was an Genoese explorer”

I understand this change was caused by the adding of fights with no official announcements, however it is misleading and has lead to actual fight articles being poor in quality. For example, Spence vs Crawford was one of the most anticipated fights of this generation and the quality of the article was appalling. In some instances, some important fight articles, like Fulton vs Inoue, haven’t been made due to fight articles typically being accessed and created through the record table. Moreso, it is misleading because it leads people reading Wikipedia to believe that said fighter has no upcoming fight. BoxRec displays this well and it is one of the main authorities of boxing record-keeping. Therefore, I request a discussion to add back upcoming fights to record tables. As per, choices are to '''Support''' or '''Oppose'''. Cheers. [[User:Faren29|Faren29]] ([[User talk:Faren29|talk]]) 16:10, 2 October 2023 (UTC)}}

This RfC relates to the removal/keeping of two nobles, Jonima and Muzaka, from the Commander/leaders section in the infobox. Earlier discussions has been mainly revolved around two views:

* One view suggests that Lazar arrived at the battle with his two allies, Vuk Brankovic, his son in law and Duke Vlatko Vuković, who served as the commander of King Tvrtko’s Bosnian army. Lazar commanded the centre; Vuk Brankovic was on the right and the left was under command of the Bosnian general Vlatko Vuković.

* The other view suggests that Jonima and Muzaka led their own troops, thereby holding an equivalent position as the other leaders of this battle.

Does this paragraph belong in the '''function''' section of the article: “According to a policy statement from the World Health Organization, it is a ‘myth’ that foreskin removal with circumcision has any adverse effect on sexual pleasure.

Some users argue that it belongs in the function section, because circumcision and foreskin function are intertwined. Others argue that the sources referenced do not even reference foreskin function, and that perhaps this belongs in the circumcision subsection of our article or otherwise.

A disagreement has arisen over [[Egyptian Arabic]] transliteration in the infobox of the [[Egypt]] article, with the discussion mainly taking place in the similarly named talk page entry. These are the two contradictory positions:

* One party states that it is merely a dialect and should therefore be omitted entirely in favor of the [[Standard Arabic]] transliteration only, regardless of phonetic differences.
* The other states that it is considered a language of its own from an academic point of view and should therefore be included as well due to its status as the national language of the country. 

The point of contention is mainly over the transliteration of the full name in the infobox, but has also spilled over to other parts of the article, such as the lead and Name sections. 

My suggestion to resolve the matter was to present credible academic sources that define the status of Egyptian Arabic, whether it's a language or a dialect, and proceed based on academic consensus. However, since the effort is largely one-sided I would prefer that other editors weigh in on the topic as well.

:'''No''': Most reliable sources clearly state that the coalition was led by Lazar Hrebeljanović, Vuk Branković and Vlatko Vuković, that's all. Other allied contingents were indeed involved, some were mercenaries or troops from other neighbouring kingdoms and principalities, including Albanians and Hungarians, but there is no evidence that any Albanian or Hungarian lord headed his troops at the same level as the three Serbian princes. Muzaka and Jonima (if the latter was indeed present, which is not certain) were most likely led by Lazar, as stated in the French book ''L'Europe et l’Islam: Quinze siècles d’histoire'', from Laurens, Tolan and Veinstein (2009), page 134:
:''Le côté serbe était représenté par trois éléments au moins : le contingent du knez Lazar Hrebeljanović qui régnait alors sur la Serbie centrale et une partie du Kosovo oriental et dont '''l’armée incluait des éléments hongrois et albanais''' ; celui de Vuk Branković qui contrôlait la plus grande partie du Kosovo ; enfin, comme à Bileća, les troupes bosniaques de Tvertko étaient commandées par Vlatko Vuković.''

I am submitting this RfC to discuss the inclusion of the Decolonial Atlas as a reliable source on relevant Wikipedia pages.

[https://decolonialatlas.wordpress.com/turtle-island-decolonized/ New research] has at long last brought accurate information about many Indigenous place names of North American cities to the public. Misinformation about these names is widespread, so the Decolonial Atlas spent 9 years consulting with hundreds of primary sources - tribal language programs and elders (all of whom are cited) - to accurately document place names for major cities and historical sites. These names are mostly unknown beyond Indigenous communities. Many are being shared publicly for the first time. 

Multiple Wikipedia editors have said that their edits to add this information to their respective Wikipedia pages keep getting rejected for citing a blog or free web host. The Decolonial Atlas is hosted on a free WordPress website. 

Self-published expert sources may be considered reliable when produced by an established subject-matter expert, whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable, independent publications. 

The Decolonial Atlas has been engaged in this work for a decade. Its expertise has been recognized by the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=591k56aMMGs BBC World News], Brown University, [https://umaine.edu/canam/publications/coming-home-map/coming-home-indigenous-place-names-canada-pdf-download/ the University of Maine], the New York Map Society, and more. The project is cited in 161 academic articles according to [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C33&q=%22Decolonial+Atlas%22&btnG= Google Scholar].

[[2024 Pakistani general election|Elections]] are due to be held in [[Pakistan]] soon. New delimitations are underway after the [[2023 Pakistani census|2023 Census]] results announced and preliminary report on delimitations has been issued by [[Election Commission of Pakistan]] as of now[https://www.dawn.com/news/1778287]. There has been alot of [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Pakistani politics#Naming conventions of constituencies|controversy]] regarding naming conventions for electoral constituencies in Pakistan on Wikipedia. It has been taken to [[Special:Permalink/1149114123#Naming_conventions_of_constituencies|Arbitration forum]] as well where it was declined and was [[User talk:امین اکبر#Naming conventions of constituencies: Arbitration request declined|advised]] to use Dispute Resolution mechanism. However it still remains unresolved and it is going to make things further worse after the final delimitations report will be announced in case we do not come with a formal policy in this regard.

[[Constituencies of Pakistan|Pakistani constituencies']] titles in current form has many issues which can be deduced from previous [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Pakistani politics#Naming conventions of constituencies|discussions]] above but one thing is for sure that they are vague and confusing for readers. Let us look at an example,<br/>
[[PP-1 Attock-I]] is a constituency for [[Provincial Assembly of the Punjab|Punjab Assembly]].
I searched [https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-qmobile&sxsrf=APwXEdeZ3M8gotzIqIK0XS4fZ1mpmHdGBw:1683560656341&q=PP+1+election+result+2013&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi51oOXiOb-AhWWNewKHcb9AQIQBSgAegQIBxAB&biw=400&bih=718&dpr=1.5 PP-1 election results 2013] on Google and it brought the snippet mentioning '''2013 Elections Shuja Khanzada of PML(N) won the seat by getting 38,971 votes''' transcluded from [[PP-1 Attock-I]] article while PP-1 in [[2013 Punjab provincial election|2013 elections]] was PP-1 Rawalpindi-I where '''Raja Ashfaq Hassan of PML-N won the seat by getting 50,982 votes'''[https://pakvoter.org/general-elections-2/pa-election-result-2013-punjab/]. Shuja Khanzada's constituency in 2013 was called PP-16 Attock-II. Even in [[PP-1 Attock-I#Election Results|history section]] of the PP-1 article it does not mention about the 2013 results of PP-1 Rawalpindi-I but it mentions the results of the PP-16 Attock-II(which is why Google is bringing wrong information) while PP-16 as of now is [[PP-16 Rawalpindi-X]]. It is a complete mess and what if after new delimitations it is again changed?

I brought the issue previously to the [[Talk:PP-1 Attock-I #Confusing search results|talkpage]] of the constituency article with no response from other editors. An [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Pakistani politics#RfC about Naming conventions of constituencies|RfC]] was also proposed previously but it was not properly framed and the process was buldgeoned with discussions without coming to a point. A proper community consensus is required to have an outcome and I think the best course of action in this regard is to have an RFC again with all the proposed and viable options for naming. It will be helpful to have a formal policy for naming of Electoral Constituencies in Pakistan.

{{rfcquote|text=
MOSTV is silent on what number format is appropriate for references to season/series and episodes within TV articles.  There are both numerical (“season 1”) and worded (“season one”) formats used within the text of the project MoS itself, and actual practice within TV articles varies widely.

WP-wide policy (MOS:NUMERAL) is that within tables and infoboxes, digits are used, but in article text including headings, numbers smaller than ten should be written as words, and proximate related numbers should follow the same format.  Otherwise, numbers ten and up are written as numerals.

I suggest that it would be helpful to add a sentence to this MoS, within the “Parent, season, and episode article structure” section, to clarify how season and episode numbers should best be formatted within TV articles.  I suggest that a choice needs to be made between the following options, before establishing consensus on the wording of such an addition:

'''Option One''': Follow MOSNUM.  Season and episode numbers in article tables and infoboxes should be in numerals, and in headings and body, should be in words if below ten, with consistent format being used for larger numbers in the same context (i.e. if seasons one through nine are in words then seasons ten up are also in words).

'''Option Two''': Follow MOSNUM except for headings and subheadings.  Thus season and episode numbers should be in numerals in tables, infoboxes and headings/sub-headings, but in words (below ten, and above in the same context) within article body.

'''Option Three''': Season and episode numbers should be expressed as numerals, in tables, infoboxes, headings and article body.

I seek editors’ views on the best approach before proposing a specific addition to the MoS. If I might finish with a personal view, I would ask that if there is support for option three, a justification for TV project articles departing so significantly from WP-wide policy does need to be advanced.

{{rfcquote|text=
Editors have recently gone back and forth in describing the ideology of Hamas in the lead. This is likely due to the fact that academic sources, popular media, and statements on/from Hamas have widely varied over the decades. Early Hamas statements explicitly called for the destruction of (at least the current conception) Israel. While statements past-2017 have been more ambiguous. While [https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/10/hamas-covenant-israel-attack-war-genocide/675602/ some academic sources take them on their word, others express doubts on whether the 2017 statement actually changed anything].

* '''Option #1:''' Hamas is predominately described as supporting the end of Israel within the article. Statements post-2017 are treated with significant skepticism.
* '''Option #2:''' Both the 1988 and 2017 statements are left outside of the lead; lead doesn't state either. The article gives relatively equal weight to those who believe there has been a changed in the goals of Hamas and those who do not. 
* '''Option #3:''' Hamas is predominately described as accepting the 1967 Israeli-Palestinian borders, post 2017. Early viewpoints are significantly trimmed from the article.
* '''Option #4:''' Another option not listed.

I'm personally in favor of #2. What do people here believe is the best solution in resolving this?

: '''#2. (Note: Creator of RFC)''' Since there hasn't been a clear consensus in the academic literature, news media sources, among other things, we shouldn't definitely state one or the other. [[User:KlayCax|KlayCax]] ([[User talk:KlayCax|talk]]) 04:54, 13 October 2023 (UTC)}}

''' Issues '''

Hi @[[User:Columbidae5|Columbidae5]], this article doesn't seem to have a NPOV and is slanted towards recent events due to the following reasons-
* primarily focuses on Malhan's accomplishments and positive qualities, highlighting his participation in popular reality shows and drawing inspiration from established YouTubers.
* usage of positive language to describe Abhishek Malhan, using words like "known" and "emerged".
* allegations are mentioned at the end of the article, after establishing a positive image, this minimizes the impact of these claims
* the article does not provide much context about Malhan's early career or his work on YouTube before he participated in Bigg Boss OTT and Temptation Island India.
* using words like "fandom war" presents the conflict in a way that is relevant to social media.

Hi Everyone

In summary researchers placed groups as Nilotic when they meant geographical location rather than ethnic i.e. people who settled along river Nile. However, in contrast to geographical, the term Nilo-Hamitic referred to ethnic groups of Ateker peoples such as Koramojong, Teso, Lango, Kumam, Turkana etc. Then Nilo-Semitic aka Shemitic are ethnic grouping of Lwo peoples e.g. Acoli, Alur, Jo Padola, Lwo/Luo of Sudan, Lwo/Luo of Kenya, Tanzania, Congo etc and some other groups that I am yet to study, I am not very well versed with this part. 

Two groups of the Ateker peoples i.e. Langi and Kumam who although currently use borrowed Lwo/Luo words and speak a mixture of their Ateker languages and Lwo/Luo, they are not Lwo and their languages cannot be classed as Lwo/Luo either. This is the view of by some editors who are trying to correct what was wrongly placed in Ethnolgue or other sources. The editors noticed that there has been erros in placing the Langi and Kumam groups under Luo/Lwo, they are not Lwo/Luo nor is their language classification.

Please google http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/35/013.html 
Scores of articles are listed there.

From page 50 onwards show that Lango, Kumam, Teso etc are grouped under Paranilotes, Plain Nilotes aka Nilo-Hamites, the anthropologists noticed that Lango and Kumam had language shift in the 18th centuary and borrowed Lwo/Luo words as well as cultures but that Kumam or Lango clans are not Lwo/Luo up todate. They are known as Nilo-Hamites of Ateker peoples together with Teso, Karmojong etc.

The Wikipedia article is currently showing the first paragraph of Lango article stating the opposite from the second pargraph if you see it under Early History section. We need to first start a review from this article if possible. 

Two citations have been placed in Lango article and one of them appears in Ateker peoples article already. They mention the points which contradic the contents of the first paragraph (please see below).

International and domestic news agencies [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/us-politics/article-new-us-house-speaker-mike-johnson/ have frequently made mention of] Speaker Johnson's [https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/mike-johnson-house-speaker-lgbtq-views-scrutiny-rcna122317 "prominent" attempts to criminalize consensual homosexual relationships] while working at the Alliance Defending Freedom.  During this time, he repeatedly wrote that homosexuals should be jailed if they engaged in consensual same-sex physical relations, supported sodomy laws, and composed arguably the most notable ''[[Amicus curiae|amicus brief]]'' to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in [[Lawrence v. Texas]] (2003) defending their constitutionality.

Several editors have suggested that wording similar to this should be introduced into the the lead:

<blockquote>While working at the [[Alliance Defending Freedom]], he advocated for [[Sodomy laws in the United States|the criminalization of gay sex]] and wrote a prominent [[Amicus curiae|''amicus'' brief]] opposing the eventual [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003).</blockquote>

Other editors have suggested that his involvement in [[covenant marriage]] laws, founding of ''Freedom Guard'', and other pieces of information is far more notable, and that the sentence is a [[WP: NPOV]] issue that immediately bias readers against Johnson.

Is this piece of information neutral ''and'' notable enough to include in the lead? [[User:KlayCax|KlayCax]] ([[User talk:KlayCax|talk]]) 06:40, 28 October 2023 (UTC)}}

Hi Everyone

In summary researchers placed groups as Nilotic when they meant geographical location rather than ethnic i.e. people who settled along river Nile. However, in contrast to geographical, the term Nilo-Hamitic referred to ethnic groups of Ateker peoples such as Koramojong, Teso, Lango, Kumam, Turkana etc. Then Nilo-Semitic aka Shemitic are ethnic grouping of Lwo peoples e.g. Acoli, Alur, Jo Padola, Lwo/Luo of Sudan, Lwo/Luo of Kenya, Tanzania, Congo etc and some other groups that I am yet to study, I am not very well versed with this part. 

Two groups of the Ateker peoples i.e. Langi and Kumam who although currently use borrowed Lwo/Luo words and speak a mixture of their Ateker languages and Lwo/Luo, they are not Lwo and their languages cannot be classed as Lwo/Luo either. This is the view of by some editors who are trying to correct what was wrongly placed in Ethnolgue or other sources. The editors noticed that there has been erros in placing the Langi and Kumam groups under Luo/Lwo, they are not Lwo/Luo nor is their language classification.

Please google http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/35/013.html 
Scores of articles are listed there.

In addition there are some articles such as 

https://web.archive.org/web/20201210010927id_/https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/29330/1/10731425.pdf 

From page 50 onwards show that Lango, Kumam, Teso etc are grouped under Paranilotes, Plain Nilotes aka Nilo-Hamites, the anthropologists noticed that Lango and Kumam had language shift in the 18th centuary and borrowed Lwo/Luo words as well as cultures but that Kumam or Lango clans are not Lwo/Luo up todate. They are known as Nilo-Hamites of Ateker peoples together with Teso, Karmojong etc.

The Wikipedia article is currently showing the first paragraph of Lango article stating the opposite from the second pargraph if you see it under Early History section. We need to first start a review from this article if possible. 

Two citations have been placed in Lango article and one of them appears in Ateker peoples article already. They mention the points which contradic the contents of the first paragraph (please see below).

There were two discussions on the topic of an RfC review noticeboard separate from AN. A [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive287#RfC_close_review_please? 2017 discussion] briefly touched on the topic, and under a recent close review, there was 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive355#The_futility_of_%22close_review%22 another one], which was relatively extensive.
It appears that there was [[WP:RFCBEFORE|enough brainstorming]] to have at least a discussion to create a new board.

'''It is proposed to:'''

*Create a separate "Close review" page (CLRV/RFCRV) to handle challenges to closures.
*Create an archive of all close reviews in one place (something like [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Closure_review_archive|this]] but updated and not self-reported)
*Generally model the CLRV on [[WP:DRV|deletion review]] processes, but with a few quirks. To be exact:
*#The duty of the user to discuss the closure with the closer will stay, [[WP:NACIP|except for closures made by IP editors]], which may be reverted without discussion.
*#When pushing a "Request a close review" button, there will be an automatically generated template (something like when opening an AE request) where the user will put the necessary data (link to the RfC, diff(s) of closure, user who closed an RfC, evidence of talking with the user, evidence of notifying them about the review, reason for making the request, possibly other fields should there be a need)
*#Create "Involved", "Uninvolved" and "Discussion" sections for discussing the merits of the closure (see [[WP:INVOLVED]] for details). Admins may sanction users who routinely post their opinions in the "Uninvolved" part of the closure if they are involved.
*#:Editors will !vote "Endorse" or "Overturn". Overturned discussions will be automatically reopened until the next closer comes. Overturned closures should be collapsed and the CLRV thread provided in the hat above the RfC for reference.
*#:CLRV should not be RfC round 2. Only closer's judgment should be analysed. Statements that rehash the arguments in the RfC or do not discuss the soundness of the closure given the arguments presented in the RfC should be discarded from consideration. (Cf. Deletion review should not be used, in [[WP:DRV]])
*#:Editors will determine the burden of demonstrating the (un)soundness of the closure if the page is created. This may potentially impact [[WP:NOCON]].
*Modify [[WP:CLOSECHALLENGE]], [[Wikipedia:Processes#Formal_review]] and other relevant policies, guidelines and information/explanatory pages to direct closure review requests to the newly created page. Edit all relevant templates and post relevant info to AN/ANI so that editors engage in close reviews on the dedicated forum.

I would like to see if there is consensus for a concept of the page, before actually starting to create it.

Also side question that we can't reach consensus over: should the article mention that near the beginning of his channel's history he made videos from his childhood bedroom? It has been suggested that these details are fancruft.

I would like to ask comments with argumentation for or against infinite [[tuple]]  concept, by which I call a presence of Infinite Tuple on [[Tuple]] page.

The problem was discussed between a couple of mathematicians with no argumentation against the concept other than missing external citations. I think there should rather be discussion about arguments in general instead of just resources. The argumentation for the concept is based on axioms of [[Set theory]] namely [[ZFC]] and mainly [[Axiom of choice]].

The opponents of the concept already attempted to ban me and separate me from editing of English Wiki. I was unbanned then, but I don't see reasonable to follow aggressive bilateral disputation with undoing actions of each other. So, I'm asking third party experts form participation in dispute.

My opinion is, that infinite tuple is inherently here, regardless how we call it. Therefore, we should not try to find different term, but rather we should note it on the [[tuple]] page. Argumentation for can be most simply based on [[Axiom of choice]] of [[ZFC]], which effectively defines  infinite [[Cartesian product]], which is quoted on its wiki page. If we have infinite [[Cartesian product]], which is apparently true, then I believe, we should have defined also infinite [[Tuple]]. We define the [[tuple]] most simply as function of [[natural number]] (as [[set (mathematics)]]). Infinite [[tuple]] is then simply function of [[ordinal number]] (as [[set (mathematics)]]).

So, please, give me independent opinion to my conclusions and relevancy of noting infinite [[Tuple]] on [[tuple]] page.

I already asked my colleague from studies on [[Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University]] for an opinion. He said, that he intuitively understood [[Tuple]] as finite but the presence of infinite [[Tuple]] on tuple page counts logical and needed.

It is so tiny problem, or no problem at all, that I'm surprised, that it triggered so much animosity. It should have been solved on [[talk]] page of the topic and it was attempted by my side. However, no compromise was reached there. [[User:Rbrane7|Rbrane7]] ([[User talk:Rbrane7|talk]]) 20:21, 25 November 2023 (UTC)}}

This page used to speak the truth, as stated in its sources. It used to say "Trump FALSELY claimed the election had been stolen." That the election was not stolen is a proven fact, indisputable by either God or Man. Indeed, the only one who attempted (and failed) to steal it is Trump, a treasonous crime for which he now stands trial, before God and all Americans. Restore the plain truth to this article. 

I humbly request that this article no longer traffic in lies, propaganda, and deceit and speak the plain unvarnished Truth: "Trump falsely claimed the election was stolen." 

Every reliable source on Earth, including those cited here, states that Trump's claims that the election was stolen were a brazen lie, without even a shred of truth to them: pure and utter fabrication.

Should the lead of the article mention that some of the political violence has been considered terrorism?

'''Survey'''

*'''Yes'''. Political violence is [[WP:EUPHEMISM]]. Censoring the word "terrorism" from the lead, despite being used extensively in reliable sources is a violation of [[WP:DUE]] and [[WP:NOTCENSORED]]. Many articles such as [[Terrorism in India]], [[Terrorism in Europe]], and [[Israel and state-sponsored terrorism]] use "terrorism". Furthermore, Google Trends and other ngrams show the much more common use of "terrorism" compared with "Palestinian political violence" and it's widespread usage in academic literature.

Every reliable source cited in the article states that Trump's claims of a stolen election are not merely false but an utter, total fabrication without basis in reality. The descriptor "false" has nevertheless been purged from the lead of the article which states merely, in contradiction to all reliable sources, that "Trump claimed the 2020 election was stolen." No reliable source cited in the article allows Trump to make this claim without immediately pointing out its craven falsity. Yet Wikipedia, for some reason, now does-- in effect, endorsing Trump's claims by failing to point out that they are a proven falsehood in their initial mention in the article, at its most prominent point. This is an outrage, and in total violation of every policy of this encylopedia; indeed, of any Encylopedia or any other publication that purports to be true. Hence, I humbly beseech you that the original, clean version of the article be restored and the descriptor "false" be appended to Trump's claims that the 2020 election was stolen in the lead (and anywhere else it may appear in the article.) 

Question: Should the lead be allowed to omit mention that Trump's claims of a stolen election are false, merely reporting proven and known falsehoods without comment, in contradiction to all reliable sources, or should the previous version of the article rightly pointing out that Trump's claims are false be restored?

I'm not very experienced so please correct me if I'm not going about this correctly. I've noticed that a vast number of aviation articles utilize information sourced exclusively to https://simpleflying.com which is a content farm that regularly plagiarizes other publications, doesn't have a reputation for fact checking, or otherwise being reliable. I began removing citations to simpleflying but realize that given how many articles utilize it, I should seek input. 

I [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard/Archive 286#Simple Flying|found a previous discussion that seems to agree with my perspective]]. It contains a lot of information but anything that's noteworthy in the aviation/airlines/airports space will have gotten coverage from more reliable publications or local news.

Per [[WP:WHO/MOS#Terminology]], the previous seasons/series of ''Doctor Who'' have been titled "Season #" for the classic era, and "Series #" for the revived era, noting the difference from when the programme moved from Season 26 to Series 1 upon the 2005 revival. This had lead up to Series 13 in 2021. According to interviews with the showrunner, as well as entries on the official ''Doctor Who'' websites, the numbering system is to be reset, to define a new "era". That is, what has previous been referred to as Series 14, will now be referred to as Season 1.

The questions are:
# Should this article be retitled to reflect this change to "Season 1", or should it remain at its "Series 14" title?
# If the article should be renamed, what should it be renamed to? (This is given that [[Doctor Who (season 1)]] already exists, representing the 1963–64 season, and [[Doctor Who (series 1)]] exists, representing the 2005 series.)
# Upon this renaming, should (and thus, what) should the previous seasons be renamed to?
Note that if this article title is changed, this should reflect upon the following entries within the programme. -- [[User:Alex 21|<span style="font-variant:small-caps;color:#02B">Alex_</span><span style="font-size:smaller;color:#02B">21</span>]]<sub>&nbsp;[[User talk:Alex 21|<span style="font-size:xx-small;color:#009">TALK</span>]]</sub> 07:51, 1 December 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
An [[WP:Deletion_review/Log/2023_November_22|ongoing DRV discussion]] brought up the question of whether the "sufficiently identical" language in CSD:G4 applies to pages deleted in AfD, and immediately recreated as a redirect by someone who wasn't pleased with the result of the AfD. Several editors believe that since the redirect page is different from the one deleted, any editor is welcome to recreate the deleted page, ''even if the "Redirect" option was brought up in the AfD and failed to reach consensus''.

The options, as I see it, are:
# G4 applies to all cases where consensus was not followed, including recreation of a page as a redirect.
# G4 does not apply to the recreation of a deleted page as a redirect, even if that option was discussed and rejected in the AfD.
# G4 applies to the recreation of a deleted page as a redirect, but only if that option was brought up and rejected in the AfD.
# Other?

To be clear, we are talking about a page recreated shortly (<30 days) after an AfD closed as ''Delete''.

Either way, there seems to be enough confusion about this to justify adding a sentence about recreation as a redirect to the language in CSD:G4.

Would appreciate more views on the subject. Thank you! [[User:OwenX|Owen&times;]] [[User talk:OwenX|<big>&#9742;</big>]] 21:02, 28 November 2023 (UTC)}}

IMO - The current paragraph on Vladmir Lenin has a number of problems in regards to neutrality. 

Firstly - It presents the totalitarian model/view of the Soviet Union as a universally accepted fact among historians and scholars. This model is one school of thought which is often juxtaposed against the revisionist view of the Soviet Union. 

Secondarily - It makes no reference to the historical context or whether Lenin consciously sought to develop a totalitarian state which later progressed into Stalinism or whether this was the byproduct of the specific event i.e. Civil War and foreign intervention.

I have sought to make a number of amendments for the purpose of neutrality and added the sources below.

This is the sentence I am proposing for inclusion into the main paragraph and would like to receive the votes of others for consensus.

However, the agreement has been announced by [https://www.instagram.com/p/C0pR_vyvLpR/ Ohtani themselves], [https://twitter.com/jjcoop36/status/1733580301589197022 his agency], and posted by [https://twitter.com/MLB/status/1733579715909169215 the official MLB Twitter]. There's significant secondary coverage of the announcement in [https://theathletic.com/5106526/2023/12/09/shohei-ohtani-signs/ ''The Athletic''] and several other high-quality outlets, like [https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/shohei-ohtani-signs-with-dodgers-two-way-superstar-joins-l-a-team-on-record-breaking-10-year-700m-deal/ CBS Sports]. Those two sources confirm that Ohtani himself announced the arrangement. 

Should the information [that Ohtani says he has agreed to a contract but no official announcement has been made] be included in this article prior to an official announcement by the Dodgers? Applicable guidelines here include [[WP:RSBREAKING]], in addition to the essay [[WP:SPORTSTRANS]]. BLP, specifically [[WP:BLPGOSSIP]] or [[WP:GRAPEVINE]], do not appear to factor in as Ohtani has spoken on this himself.

There's a dispute between @[[User:M.Bitton|M.Bitton]] and myself as to whether the article should contain [[:Category:Moroccan Arabic words and phrases]]. M.Bitton claims it should not be added on the basis that the term is not exclusively Moroccan. I don't think this is a necessary condition, and adding that category does not exclude adding similar categories for Tunisian and Algerian Arabic, provided there are sources to support. M.Bitton keeps removing the changes I made in the article, including a reliable source (Dictionary of Moroccan Arabic). So as to avoid edit warring, I request comments from experienced editors in the project.--[[User:Ideophagous|Ideophagous]] ([[User talk:Ideophagous|talk]]) 16:14, 12 November 2023 (UTC)}}

Because of this, I propose to add 'Eastern Europe' mention in the lede. My proposal is;

"'''Estonia, officially the Republic of Estonia, is a country by the Baltic Sea in Eastern and Northern Europe.'''"

Also, [[Italy]] article mentioning both Southern and Western Europe when describing Italy's geographic locale. In my point of view, this article should follow the similar way to Italy article.

This Request for Comments seeks community input on two key issues regarding the Konstantine Anthony Wikipedia article:

1. '''Copyright Concerns:''' The image titled "Konstantine Anthony, 2022.jpg" (sourced from [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Konstantine_Anthony,_2022.jpg)) was uploaded to Wikimedia Commons by [User:Reppop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Reppop). The image is claimed to be a work of the City of Burbank, and its original source is the city's official website ([link](https://www.burbankca.gov/konstantine-anthony)). It's crucial to determine whether the City of Burbank, as an incorporated city, holds copyright to this image, which may not be public domain like federal agency images. It is common for municipal government entities to claim copyright over works they create, unless they specify otherwise or release them into the public domain. This raises concerns about whether the image was uploaded and used without proper consent or release of copyright by the City. Considering Wikipedia's strict adherence to copyright laws, should this image be retained or removed based on its copyright status?

2. '''Editing Dispute and Potential Bias:''' The same user who uploaded the image, [User:Reppop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Reppop), has been actively adding it to the Konstantine Anthony article. Observations indicate that the page has undergone rapid edits, possibly portraying a politically positive spin, potentially in line with Konstantine Anthony's upcoming run for county supervisor. This could raise questions about neutrality and the presence of a politically motivated campaign influencing the article's content. How should Wikipedia address this potential bias to maintain the neutrality and integrity of the article?

Given these concerns, I seek the community's perspectives on whether the image should be retained or deleted, and how to address the potential bias in the article's edits.

Should we state in the lead that the Colorado Court ruled that Trump is disqualified from the presidency under the 14th amendment for engaging in insurrection, and ordered that he be removed from the Colorado ballot as a result?

Reliable sources like CBS news describe the Colorado ruling as follows: "In a stunning decision that could have major ramifications for the 2024 presidential election, the Colorado Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that former President Donald Trump is disqualified from holding office again and ordered the secretary of state to remove his name from the state's primary ballot." https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colorado-supreme-court-opinions-decision-trump-primary-ballot/. The Court itself describes its holding in very similar terms: "A majority of the court holds that President Trump is ineligible from holding the office of President under section three of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution...The sum of these parts is this: President Trump is disqualified from holding the office of President under Section Three; because he is disqualified, it would be a wrongful act under the Election Code for the Secretary to list him as a candidate on the presidential primary ballot." Should we add this material to the lead and adopt similar language, stating something like: 
<blockquote>The Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump is disqualified from the Presidency under section three of the 14th amendment for engaging in insurrection against the United States, and ordered that he be removed from the Colorado presidential ballot as a result. The decision is stayed pending appeal to the United States Supreme Court.</blockquote> [[Special:Contributions/67.82.74.5|67.82.74.5]] ([[User talk:67.82.74.5|talk]]) 20:21, 20 December 2023 (UTC)}}

Inasmuch as multiple readers or even a single reader at different times may seek more extended or conversely more condensed versions of longer articles, and especially inasmuch as Wikipedia article sizes are generally expected to continue on an indefinite growth trajectory over time - in concept, should we begin to explore the idea of the creation of both an extended version as well as a condensed version of longer articles on the English Wikipedia mainspace, and hence allowing the reader the choice of either option at any given time? The condensed version would be one that heavily emphasizes tight summaries and forking to subarticles within English Wikipedia, (bearing no relationship to its counterpart article on Simple English Wikipedia); while the extended version would be more comprehensive and allow for more important points from subarticles to be included into its own sections and subsections, with generally much more tolerance of length vis-a-vis both sections and the article itself?

There has been a constant back and forth between ''Born to Be'' being classified as a studio album as is the status quo or as an extended play (EP; mini album), as some editors have proposed. The former argues that this is the case due to anticipated length of the release, noting the number of tracks, as well as the sources in the article supporting the notion that the release is indeed a studio album. In contrast, some editors have suggested that the release is a mini album (categorically equivalent to an EP), noting the press releases made by the group's agency as well as the labelling on the album's packaging. Furthermore, I would like to request for comments regarding this matter to finally settle it at once.

{{rfcquote|text=
So there have been disputes on this page over the inclusion of flagicons, other peerages held by peers whose highest titles were in the Peerage of Scotland and subsequent extinctions of peerages. 

'''Item 1''': With the flagicons, they have been removed from similar pages such as [[1999 House of Lords elections]] and [[By-elections to the House of Lords]] on the grounds that peers do not represent countries in the House of Lords, thus this is in contravention of [[:MOS:FLAG]]. However, it could be argued that since only specific peerages gave a right to sit in the House of Lords, it may be relevant to show which title was in which peerage, since titles in the [[Peerage of Ireland]] did not have automatic representation, thus some Irish peers had lower titles in [[Peerage of England]], [[Peerage of Great Britain]], and/or the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]] by which they sat in the House of Lords. 

'''Item 2''': However, related to this issue, the page also added such listing of lower titles to peers whose highest titles were in the [[Peerage of Scotland]], even though the [[Peerage Act 1963]], to quote that article, "granted peers of Scotland the same right to sit in the House of Lords as peers of England, Great Britain or the United Kingdom", thus their holding of titles in other peerages doesn't seem relevant to their membership.

'''Item 3''': There was also notes adding marking which peerages subsequently became extinct, many of which happened years, if not decades after the act was imposed, which doesn't appear to be directly related to the Act.

Should these items be included in the article or not? [[Special:Contributions/2601:249:9301:D570:DCE:DB6E:BCC:F04D|2601:249:9301:D570:DCE:DB6E:BCC:F04D]] ([[User talk:2601:249:9301:D570:DCE:DB6E:BCC:F04D|talk]]) 19:47, 24 November 2023 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The use of "Independent Liberal/Labor" is a term that is not permitted in elections for parties/candidates or for electoral material, so to use them in lists like these is completely erroneous. Under sections 64 and 180 of the [https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/html/inforce/2023-10-30/act-2017-066#sec.64 Electoral Act 2017], this is not permitted. You may include a reference to individual party membership in the notes section, but they do not sit under this label, they were not elected as such, they are not permitted to use such labels under NSW law, and it is misleading to describe them so.[[User:Siegfried Nugent|Siegfried Nugent]] ([[User talk:Siegfried Nugent|talk]]) 08:52, 29 November 2023 (UTC)}}
