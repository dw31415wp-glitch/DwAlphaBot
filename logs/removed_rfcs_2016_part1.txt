{{rfcquote|text=
The following paragraph from the Muhammad article is in dispute. "Traditional sources dictate Aisha was six or seven years old when betrothed to Muhammad,[150][227][228] with the marriage not being consummated until she had reached puberty at the age of nine or ten years old.[150][227][229][230][231][232][233] She was therefore a virgin at marriage.[227] A small number of modern Muslim writers have estimated her age between 12 and 24.[234][235][236]"

The dispute ranges on whether the statement about Aisha reaching puberty is [[WP:UNDUE]], whether the paragraph itself is [[WP:UNDUE]], or if a footnote should be included to say that young marriages during the 600s was normal.(UTC)

The discussion and additional sources can be found on this talk page in sections: 1) [[Talk:Muhammad#Aisha_.22reaching_age_of_puberty.22|Aisha "reaching age of puberty"]], 2) [[Talk:Muhammad#Removal_of_paragraph|Removal of paragraph]], 3) [[Talk:Muhammad#The_thing_that_should_actually_be_disputed|The thing that should actually be disputed]], 4) [[Talk:Muhammad#Proposal_for_changes_on_Aisha.27s_mariage|Proposal for changes on Aisha's mariage]].

{{rfcquote|text=
A recent large number of edits have been dropping material from the biography and legacy section of the Bach article at Wikipedia making it unrealistic concerning Bach's legacy. The apparent desire of the recent editors is to present a prettified and Disneyland version of the biography of Bach which deletes the rough times of Bach's legacy immediately after his death and the irreparable losses of huge parts of his manuscripts and compositions. This material was present in the Bach article earlier this year as edited by User:Buxtehude from 27 March 2015 all the way up to the recent forced deletion of the material by two recent editors in preference for the prettified and Disneyland version of Bach's legacy in an idealized version of the Bach article in its current form. The material by Buxtehude should be restored to the article in the realist version of the article which accurately represents the rough times which Bach's legacy faced in its previous Wikipedia form given as: 

:'''Many of Bach's unpublished manuscripts were distributed among the family members at the time of his death. Unfortunately, the poor financial condition of some of the family members led to the undocumented sale or destruction of parts of the unpublished compositions of Bach, including over 100 cantatas and his ''[[St Mark Passion (Bach)|St Mark Passion]]'', of which no copies are known to survive. At one point, the diary of one family member records the selling of the high quality parchment used for the hand-written transcriptions to be used for their stock value as packing paper at a local butcher shop due to harsh financial necessity''', from Buxtehude on 27 March 2015. 

The question for this RfC is: Whether to SUPPORT the restoration of the deleted material of the realistic representation of Bach's legacy from the time of his death 1750 to 1829, which was the year of the Mendelssohn revival of Bach's reputation as a composer?

We need to reach consensus on when/if community radio stations are notable. None of [[WP:BROADCAST]],  [[WP:BCASTOUTCOMES]] and [[WP:NMEDIA]] have the status of ''policy'', however some argue that long-standing norms suggest that broadcast radio stations with a license from a national regulator (OFCOM in the UK, FCC in the USA etc) ''and'' independent notes of existence in local media are notable. Others argue that some/all of these stations are not notable - pointing to the lack of significant secondary references in books and other reliable sources. So the question is this: is a permanent licensed broadcast radio station notable, however small the area of broadcast? If not, how big does the area have to be? Is the standard of having been noted in (let's say) national media as per [[WP:GNG]] relevant?   [[User:JMWt|JMWt]] ([[User talk:JMWt|talk]]) 17:59, 8 December 2015 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
I'm wondering about [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ogrodzieniec,_Warmian-Masurian_Voivodeship&diff=prev&oldid=696166839 this edit] I made. Boldfacing the existing instance of "Neudeck" contained in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Lang-de foreign language term template] at the time seemed an expedient way to have a boldface instance present for those arriving via [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neudeck the disambiguation page]. I later reworked another instance of "Neudeck" into the lede text and boldfaced it instead (largely to avoid contentious entanglement with another editor).

*In boldfacing "Neudeck" at all I'm presuming that the convention that holds for a standard name redirect, boldfacing ''"to follow the "principle of least astonishment" after following a redirect"'' ([[MOS:BOLD]]), also logically applies to terms arrived at in similar fashion but directed through an intermediary disambiguation page instead of directly to an article via a name redirect page.

:''Rationale:'' If for example "Neudeck" did not have alternate usages requiring disambiguation then wikilinking <code><nowiki>[[Neudeck]]</nowiki></code> in another article would presumably take one directly to [[Ogrodzieniec, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]] (via a standard name redirect page's functionality). At present wikilinking <code><nowiki>[[Neudeck]]</nowiki></code> in an article takes one to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neudeck a disambiguation page] which then offers a link to the [[Ogrodzieniec, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]] article, amongst others. In such cases it seems fair to say the disambiguation page acts as a specialized form of redirect. One which requires reader discretion and input rather than automatically displaying the target. Via this rationale, it seems fair to extend [[MOS:BOLD]]'s  guidelines on redirect terms and synonyms to terms arrived at via a disambiguation page in lieu of a distinct name redirect.

:*Agree/concur/object/suggest/other relevant guidelines?

*My next premise is the presumption that it doesn't really matter whether boldfaced text in the lede is displayed via boldface markup within template markup, <code><nowiki>{{foo|'''word'''}}</nowiki></code>, or just via boldface markup in the body of text, <code><nowiki>'''word'''</nowiki></code>. ''As the result in the eye of the reader'' '''''is text emphasized via boldface''''' regardless of underlying markup. They see what they see. i.e. I'm presuming the mechanics are irrelevant to the style guideline. Presumably the style guidelines focus on the end result, what is displayed to the reader, leaving the mechanics as a means-to-an-end.

:*Agree/concur/object/suggest/other relevant guidelines?

Getting back to specifics, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ogrodzieniec,_Warmian-Masurian_Voivodeship&diff=prev&oldid=696166839 my edit] was fine, right? And doing so in similar circumstances in the future would typically be within style guidelines as well, correct?

Most recently [[:File:Great Seal of Canada.png|this image]] of the [[Great Seal  of Canada]] has been proposed to be added to the article inlue of the coat of arms (currently in the article).  The question being asked here is in 2 parts....First does the image merit inclusion in the lead (is it a image that represents Canada that it should be a lead image) and secondly is this specific  image of good enough quality to be a lead image in an FA article (can people see what the image is all about).  

*Questions that have been asked and there is no debate over 
:Yes other articles use the seal as a symbol in the lead - eg. [[United States]]
:Yes the Great Seal of Canada is a "National Symbol"  -  [http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1363632655992/1363632732678 source]

'''Recent version:''' Recently, the article stated [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_L._Jones&oldid=695535680]:<blockquote>On September 17, 2015, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' published an article reporting on an upcoming battery booster product, the [[Batteriser]], and controversy surrounding the claim that it could extend battery life by up to eight times.   Dave Jones published at EEVBlog a detailed 40-minute theoretical 'takedown' of Batteroo's claims  without having the product.. The CEO of Batteroo, the [[San Jose]] [[startup company|tech startup]] behind the Batteriser, stated that "every single one" of Jones' points was wrong, indicated that legal action against Jones was being considered, claimed that Jones had no formal electronic engineering credentials, and alleged that Jones was in the employ of [[Duracell]] (a claim that company denied). Three electronics and battery storage experts interviewed for the article concurred in finding the product claims of 8x battery life extension, misleading.<ref name="smh-batteriser">{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/batteriser-battery-life-extender-scam-or-saviour-20150915-gjmrql.html | title=Batteriser battery life extender: scam or saviour? | publisher=Sydney Morning Herald | date=17 Sep 2015 | accessdate=5 November 2015 | last=Francis |first= Hannah |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smh.com.au%2Fdigital-life%2Fdigital-life-news%2Fbatteriser-battery-life-extender-scam-or-saviour-20150915-gjmrql.html&date=2015-11-10|archivedate=November 10, 2015}}</ref>

Earlier, on September 2, 2015, the ''EEVBlog'' channel received a number of "dislikes," which Jones alleged was an attempt to demote the rank of a second video criticizing the Batteriser—it was later discovered that other YouTube channels with videos critical of the Batteriser were similarly affected.<ref>[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/we-dislike-you-vietnam-hackers-give-youtube-videos-thumbs-down-1518821 "Hackers spamming YouTube videos with dislikes using hijacked Vietnamese IP addresses"], ''[[International Business Times]],'' September 7, 2015</ref><ref name="dellsecureworks">[http://www.secureworks.com/resources/blog/negative-feedback-attack-on-a-youtube-channel/ "Negative Feedback – Attack on a YouTube Channel"], , by Joe Stewart, September 3, 2015, ''Dell Secure Networks''</ref> A researcher at [[Dell SecureWorks]] noted that the majority of the dislikes arrived "all at once in massive spikes that did not correlate with an increase in the number of views to the videos being disliked," and explained that dislike spam is a way to manipulate YouTube's view recommendation system.<ref name="dellsecureworks"/></blockquote>

'''Proposed version:''' <blockquote>In mid 2015 Jones published a video blog disputing the claims made by the manufacturer of a then unreleased battery life extender, the [[Batteriser]]. Batteroo, the company behind the product, refuted Jones' arguments and published a number of demonstration videos in response.<ref name="smh-batteriser">{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/batteriser-battery-life-extender-scam-or-saviour-20150915-gjmrql.html | title=Batteriser battery life extender: scam or saviour? | publisher=Sydney Morning Herald | date=17 Sep 2015 | accessdate=5 November 2015 | last=Francis |first= Hannah |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smh.com.au%2Fdigital-life%2Fdigital-life-news%2Fbatteriser-battery-life-extender-scam-or-saviour-20150915-gjmrql.html&date=2015-11-10|archivedate=November 10, 2015}}</ref> Jones' videos received a number of "dislikes," which he alleged was an attempt to demote the their rank. <ref>[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/we-dislike-you-vietnam-hackers-give-youtube-videos-thumbs-down-1518821 "Hackers spamming YouTube videos with dislikes using hijacked Vietnamese IP addresses"], ''[[International Business Times]],'' September 7, 2015</ref>"</blockquote>

Original communication at [[Wikipedia:Bot_requests#AD_.2F_CE_-_BC_.2F_BCE_Suggestion]] moved here as maybe more appropriate space 
I am asking that someone with the necessary skill looks at a BOT that can, if agreed, add the following;
* Link: [[Anno Domini|AD]] to [[Common Era|CE]] and [[BC]] to [[BCE]].This would only need to be done once per article (maybe in the first instance of it occurring) a suitable article, for example, is [[History of timekeeping devices]]. It may also be required to wikilink AD / BC in the first place. If feasible the Bot should be able to reverse link (BCE to BC) the critical action is that AD is linked to CE and BD to BCE, whatever starting point is within the reviewed article. 
* Why: AD and BC are based on a presumed date of a birth of deity and whilst whether it is factually correct is irrelevant, it has become the standard universal dating method. 1) Wikipedia as an encyclopedia, needs to inform that there is alternative terminology, and that within many educational establishments the measurement of time on this scale is taught through CE and BCE. Please see, for example one of many previous discussions at [[Talk:History_of_timekeeping_devices#WP:ERA]]. Whether the link is within the text of the article or separated out for whatever reason is another discussion, the importance is the one link between [[Anno Domini|AD]] to [[Common Era|CE]]and [[BC]] to [[BCE]].

There was already a consensus that articles about ethnic groups or similarly large human populations should not be illustrated by a gallery of images of group members, because selecting them is normally [[WP:OR|original research]], and often contentious (see the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Ethnic_groups&oldid=698001382#Proposal_for_the_deletion_of_all_the_galleries_of_personalities_from_the_infoboxes_of_articles_about_ethnic_groups corresponding discussion]).

I suggest the removal of collage from the infobox, because of lacking objective criteria; it is original research to determine who should be featured in the gallery. Who is for? Who is against?

1933: Ivo refused to be included into the Croatian Lyrics Antology

Source: Научни састанак слависта у Вукове дане, Volume 22, Issues 1-2 Међународни славистички центар, 1994 стр 209

Upon the Mihovil Kombol request for inclusion of his lyrics into the Croatian Lyrics Anthology Ivo replied on November 14 1933: "Не бих никад могао учествовати у једној публикацији из које би принципијелно били искључени други наши мени блиски песници само због тога што су или друге вере или роћени у другој покрајини. То није моје веровање од јуче него од моје прве младости, а сад у зрелим годинама таква се основна вредновања не мењају".

They went to live with her parents in Visegrad on the banks of the Drina, where the young Ivo grew up in an artisan family (his grandfather was a carpenter) playing on the bridge he was later to make so famous, and listening to tales about its origin and history which he used so skillfully to define the character of early Ottoman presence in that remote Bosnian town. The family was orthodox Christian, i.e. Serb; "

Source: Ivo Andric The Bridge on the Drina The University of Chicago Press, 1977 Introduction by William H. McNeil, page 3

We clearly see two facts: Ivo publicly denied his Croatian origins, call himself a Serb; his contemporaries and friends wrote about him being a Serb, which covers a long period of his life from 1914-1975.

William H. McNeill wrote that Ivo's mother was a Serb and that she moved to her parents after her husband's death. This information comes from Ivo and it is in the line of his denial of his Croatian origins. Instead, we read that Ivo's mother moved to her sister in law Ana and her husband Ivan Matkovic (actually Matkovsik) The earliest claim of this type came from a Croat, Z. Juricic in his essays about Andric, ''Letters Ivo Andrić Serbian Heritage Academy, 1984'' стр 85 и ''The Man and the Artist: Essays on Ivo Andrić Želimir B. Juričić University Press of America'', 1986  стр 98  

About his relations with his aunt and her husband we can learn from Ivo's letters form 1918, 1925, 1927 where is no clue about himself moving to live with his aunt after his father death. Juricic did not ever give a primary source supporting his claim. He carefully avoids mentioning Andric distancing himself from the Croats.

Unquestioned about his writing about Andric, William McNeill is quoted at least six times

Should the default [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-rendering-math| Math appearance preference]] (most importantly for non logged in users) be changed from [[PNG]] to [[MathML]]? (getting the legibility on some devices fixed at the same time) [[User:Hungryce|Hungryce]] ([[User talk:Hungryce|talk]])

''' Reference '''

No edits would have to be done because it is simply a [[Special:Preferences|Preference]] at [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-rendering-math]]. As far as I can tell it won't break anything because of it being simply a visual [[Special:Preferences|Preference]]. Any page with math on would be affected but again no actual 'edit' would happen on that page, actually because it is per user the server would not have to do any work. A low spec machine would probably not be running a modern browser that supports MathML and would use SVG or PNG automatically which has the same impact as current math rendering. If there was a problem you could turn it back to PNG or text only. There might me a slight time penalty because you browser would have to figure out what display to use but that would be insignificant compared to the processor use of the browser. No edit-a-thon would be required! The MathML '''is''' already an option, just not the default. I think that it would be the default for new users and a notification would be put out to notify existing users about it.

Non logged in users have no ability to change the [[Special:Preferences|preferences]] and therefor this option. This means that this is even more important for them to have this change because logged in users can edit this if they wish.

I has been noted that in some cases the legibility of primes (example: <math>f'(x), f''(x), f'''(x)</math>) is not so good ([[phab:F199505|screen shot]]) but that can be fixed and if this is passed it will be fixed before the [[Special:Preferences|Preference]] is changed.

There are 2-3 sources which are used for the claim that A is considered pseudoscience. One reference is from the [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiJKseis6OYC&pg=PA20 Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry], which is used to suggest that A is per se pseudoscience. The part cited is rather brief and probably more within the scope of psychological aspects, not judging different herbal remedies. Besides that, there is also the mention that A is probably just a protoscience. But based on the Oxford source alone, when reading the article one gets the impression that almost all of India is just sticking to pseudoscience when it comes to medicine, since the protoscience aspect is only twice mentioned. Pseudoscience is mentioned 5 times. The section on research also mentions pseudoscience, but makes clear distinctions between research and methodologies and thus it depends on applied research methods. 

The main source for the claim is very poor and we should at least name the source instead of giving readers a wrong impression about A in general.

{{rfcquote|text=
We are currently recommending that the sign ⟨ɵ⟩ be used for a reduced vowel diaphoneme that can correspond either to the phoneme /oʊ/ or the phoneme /ə/, for example in the word '''''o'''mission''. Should we continue to do so?

In the IPA, the sign ⟨ɵ⟩ represents the [[close-mid central rounded vowel]]. Our use of ⟨ɵ⟩ is based on {{citation|last=Bolinger|first=Dwight|authorlink=Dwight Bolinger|year=1986|title=Intonation and Its Parts|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=347-360}}. Bolinger proposed not to analyze the reduced vowels as mere versions of the full vowels, but as a special set consisting of three vowels: The “fronted” ''Willie'' vowel /ɨ/, the “central” ''Willa'' vowel /ə/, and the “backed” ''willow'' vowel /ɵ/. Bolinger’s use is slightly different from ours (1) because Bolinger’s /ɵ/ is not a diaphoneme, but a phoneme; (2) because there are words such as ''will'''ow''''' or ''lass'''o''''' or the second part of the {{sc|MOUTH}} diphthong where Bolinger would use /ɵ/, but we would not; and (3) because Bolinger’s analysis allows for an alternation between /ɵ/ and /ə/ in words such as ''can'''o'''py'', ''Ind'''o'''nesia'', ''all'''o'''phonic'', or ''comp'''o'''sition''.

The English Wikipedia is the only major dictionary that has adopted Bolinger’s sign ⟨ɵ⟩ in a broad phonemic IPA transcription scheme (for an overview of other dictionaries’ broad phonemic IPA transcription schemes, see [[Help:IPA conventions for English#Reduced vowels]]).

If you are interested in the edit history of ⟨ɵ⟩ on [[Help:IPA for English]], you may want to check out [[User:J. 'mach' wust/sandbox#Edit history of ⟨ɵ⟩]] (with diff links etc.). --[[User:J.

It is my view that this paper does not support the statement. I have no issue with including a link to the paper within this article, since it's clearly relevant, but as I think I have made clear, ''that is not the place''. To include it as a source for the fact of republication is technically [[WP:OR]] and in any case is unnecessary as the existing secondary source covers it. To include it where it is, as a source for the review process, is simply wrong, as the paper itself does not cover this.

The options appear to be:
# Include the reference as a source for ''In June 2014 Séralini republished the article in the journal ''[[Environmental Sciences Europe]]'', which did not conduct any further [[peer review]]. Reviewers checked only that the scientific content of the paper had not changed.''
# Include the paper within the article, but not as a reference fir this para.

Preventing an [[WP:EDITWAR|edit war]], I have decided to bring this issue to the talk page—which, does not only affect this page. The designation of <code>Queen's Representative&nbsp;–</code> is, in my opinion, an inappropriate one. As there is not always going to be a Queen, this title will render redundant once the royal succession occurs, and we will have to figure whether to have <code>Queen's Representative&nbsp;–</code> or <code>King's Representative&nbsp;–</code>. We cannot have both. <code>Monarchical Representative&nbsp;–</code>, to me, was a compromise and gender-neutral. Among debates with this [[User:Zoltan Bukovszky|user]], he claims that I have ''invented'' the term of Monarchical Representative. This is absolute nonsense. There was nothing to invent, the Queen's Representative (of which there is only one worldwide), is a monarchical representative. This is a description, a designation; '''not''' a title.

Expert attention requested also if somebody here reads Sinhalese readily.

About a week ago, {{userlinks|Ceylonpedia}} added material to the article about destruction of a banyan tree during production of the movie. I rewrote a compromise version of the text, but {{userlinks|Koala15}} deleted it outright.

The issue seems to be the ''Divaina'' story used as a source.[http://www.divaina.com/2015/12/20/feature14.html] It's in Sinhalese, and I'm reading the Google machine-translated version of the text. As best as I can see, the newspaper is accusing the production company of destroying the tree. It's hard to tell if this is an editorial opinion or the result of journalistic investigation, but it feels like the former. So, that creates an issue of [[WP:V|verifiability]] and self-sourcing.

I'd like some fresh eyes to look at this and help determine a few things:
# Is ''Divaina'' a source we should refrain from using?
# If not, is it writing in editorial tone instead of journalistic?
# If it is editorial tone, can we use the material at all, or is it an unbacked allegation? Or, do we need to disclaim it by saying that the newspaper is making the accusation?

Again, I think getting a few more editors involved would help, especially if they can read the article directly. —'''[[User:C.Fred|C.Fred]]''' ([[User_talk:C.Fred|talk]]) 21:17, 25 December 2015 (UTC)}}

'''Question''': Should this article make reference to the Bosnian Serb politician [[Biljana Plavšić]] ''stepping over the body of a dead [[Bosniak]]'' to kiss the Serb paramilitary leader [[Željko Ražnatović]] (aka Arkan)?

The current version of the article makes reference to a photograph in the following terms: {{tq|A photograph, described as "widely-circulated" and "notorious", reportedly shows Plavšić stepping over the body of a dead Bosniak civilian during the kiss.}} The kiss between Plavšić and Arkan is not at issue here, there are many reliable sources that mention it, and it has been accepted as an agreed fact in several prosecutions at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The question of this RfC is whether Plavšić ''stepping over the body of a dead Bosniak'', or words to that effect, should be mentioned in the article, given that a significant number of sources mention this detail while a significant number of sources do not. If you consider it should be mentioned in the article, please indicate what wording you consider should be used. Plavšić is still alive, so [[WP:BLP]] obviously applies. The [[#Table of sourced statements|table below]] lists sources/quotes that <u>mention the "Plavšić stepping over the body of a dead Bosniak to kiss Arkan</u>" detail in some form, as well as a list of sources/quotes that <u>don't mention any dead body</u> during "the kiss". This is a bit of a contentious and complex RfC, so it would be appreciated if interested editors would do a bit of fact-checking/reading before placing a comment either way. I suggest editors use the terms '''Include''' or '''Do not include''' along with their comments and/or suggested wording.

As discussed before,[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_best-selling_music_artists/Archive_32#.23Artists_by_reputed_sales_images_and_500_million_figure] one editor removed the source published by Wiley.com, a highly [[WP:RS]],[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_best-selling_music_artists&diff=next&oldid=691252631] because it is not a "news agencies, and/or music magazines such as Billboard, Rolling Stone", with relation to the 500 million sales figure about Beatles, while accepting[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_best-selling_music_artists&diff=next&oldid=691190456] a totally non-expertised one liner about Elvis Presley having 500 million sales[http://www.ibtimes.com/elvis-presley-quotes-10-things-he-said-remember-icon-anniversary-his-death-2054613].

So we have two proposals here:-

* Remove 500 million sales figure regarding Elvis Presley, because it comes from a random source, having no expertise in sales estimates.

or

* Include 500 million sales figure regarding Beatles, because it is backed by a [[WP:RS]]. [[User:Excelse|Excelse]] ([[User talk:Excelse|talk]]) 16:23, 4 January 2016 (UTC)}}

Any editor may ask the Committee to reconsider or amend a ruling, which the Committee may accept or decline at its discretion.

ITN is occasionally dominated by news of a single type, which is a consequence of several newsworthy items of that type happening at the same time. Should ITN have in-built controls against this happening?

Example: if five countries have elections at the same time and all the articles are updated, ITN may wind up featuring all five elections at the same time. Since there is only so much space, this means ITN becomes politics-dominated. Under the status quo, we live with this until such time as more news items are nominated and posted.

'''Option 1''': Yes. A single news type dominating ITN is a problem. </br>
'''Option 2''': No. A single news type dominating ITN is a problem but the status quo is the best solution. </br>

As the first step to the adoption of Wikidata, I '''propose''' the following:

'''A'''. That we recognize that it is advantageous to read the information about the Commons category on Wikidata rather than to keep it locally - meaning removing the category name parameter from {{tl|commonscat}} (in the situation Wikidata has the info) would not be considered as disruptive and can be, in principle, carried out by bot on a large scale. (I do not intend to do it myself).

'''B'''. If we agree on A, there are two ways to visualize the information (note that they are not mutually exclusive):

'''B1'''. To continue doing what we are already doing, i.e. using {{tl|commonscat}}, {{tl|commonscat-inline}}, and having the dedicated field in some specialized templates (for example, it is included in {{tl|Infobox Russian district}}, see [[Rzhevsky District]] for an example of an application).

'''B2'''. To keep the link to the category on Commons on the left panel, similarly to how it is used in Wikivoyage and some other Wikipedias, see [[:voy:Fontainebleau]] for an example).

PS. I am not aware of any previous discussions of this topic; I will appreciate links if appropriate.
PPS. I in principle intend to advertise this as RfC, however, I would like to wait for a day for comments before adding the template - possibly the issue has been discussed already, or some good ideas will be forthcoming.--[[User:Ymblanter|Ymblanter]] ([[User talk:Ymblanter|talk]]) 11:51, 4 January 2016 (UTC)}}

There is only one photograph (actually, a [[daguerreotype]]) of Emily Dickinson which is known to exist. I'm arguing that the photograph should be used on her article with little to none modifications. A couple of editors have refused to accept that, presenting no decent reasons (other than "[[Wikipedia:I just don't like it|I just don't like it]]"). Since I'm unable to reason with them, I thought it would be wiser to ask others in the community to expose their ideas regarding the subject. My reasoning is quite simple: the version presently in use is small, heavily retouched, with grey tones, and of lesser quality. For me, it makes far more sense to use the original, unedited and with greater quality, version.

Should an "[[a-prefixing]]" guideline be added to [[WP:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Composition titles]]?  Currently, different constructions are used for WP article titles: "[[Frog Went A-Courting]]", "[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]", "[[Hear My Train A Comin']]", "[[Here We Come A-wassailing]]", "[[Hold On, I'm A Comin']]", "[[A-Hunting We Will Go]]", "[[Keep A-Knockin']]", "[[The Times They Are a-Changing]]", "[[Train Kept A-Rollin']]", etc.  The current guideline addresses capitalization for composition titles, but not for "a-prefixing" ("a-Comin'" vs "A-Comin'", etc.).  

A recent discussion has identified several options ("Hear My Train A Comin'" is used to illustrate the differences):

:1) Titles should reflect what is found in a preponderance of reliable sources, regardless of capitalization or use of a hyphen – "Hear My Train A Comin'"

:2) Titles should be standardized to a lower case "a" and hyphen – "Hear My Train a-Comin'"

:3) Titles should be standardized to an upper case "A" and hyphen – "Hear My Train A-Comin'"

:4) Titles should be standardized to an upper case "A" and hyphen, but lower case second part – "Hear My Train A-comin'"

:5) Any combination of lower and upper case is acceptable, as long as a hyphen is used – 2), 3), or 4)

Which of these is preferable for a guideline for all composition titles? —[[User:Ojorojo|Ojorojo]] ([[User talk:Ojorojo|talk]]) 20:34, 20 December 2015 (UTC)}}

==Introduction'''

'''Background'''

{{see also|Wikipedia:2015 administrator election reform/Phase I/RfC|Wikipedia:2015 administrator election reform/Phase II/RfC}}
[[WP:RFA|Requests for adminship]] (commonly abbreviated as "RfA") is the process by which the Wikipedia community selects its [[WP:ADMIN|administrators]], trusted users who have the ability to perform certain technical actions. There is widespread consensus that the RfA process is broken, for various reasons, and many reform efforts over the past years have been unsuccessful. In late 2015, a new project, [[WP:RFA2015|RFA2015]], was launched. In the first phase of this project, which consisted of an [[Wikipedia:2015 administrator election reform/Phase I/RfC|RfC]], the community successfully identified the problems with the RfA process. One of those problems is a hostile environment. In the same RfC, it was suggested that to remedy this problem, we allow certain users (called "clerks") to maintain order and decorum at RfA. 

In his closing statement, the closer of that RfC concluded that the "community would like to discuss the idea of clerking", and we will do that in this RfC. Originally, the issue of clerking was to be discussed as a part of the [[Wikipedia:2015 administrator election reform/Phase II/RfC|Phase II RfC]] for RFA2015, but it was determined that because of the issue's complexity, it would be best to discuss it in a separate RfC. Set forth below are proposals concerning: (1) The responsibilities of RfA clerks; (2) Which users are authorized to perform those tasks. This RfC will run for 30 days and will be as widely advertised as possible, since the results may have a major impact on the RfA process.

On [[Wikipedia talk:Non-free content#Next Steps]], it has been proposed to make a talk header template for the TimedText talk namespace to deal with the following issues:
# The namespace TimedText is generally poorly documented in its purpose, and because of technical restrictions documentation can only be put on TimedText talk pages.
# Some of the TimedText namespace content is non-free content but there is no marking at all about this, or any practice to put Non-free use rationales or such things. Again, any such markings can only be put on the TimedText talk namespace. Discussion on whether having non-free TimedText is desirable or legal is currently happening on the abovelinked talk page.
# TimedText pages can easily become orphaned if the corresponding filepage is deleted/moved; there is no warning to deleting administrators or filemovers that there is a TimedText page.

'''''Propose amending the first sentence of the third paragraph from:'''''

:"Today, in most of the [[Islamic world]], homosexuality is not socially or legally accepted."

'''''To:'''''

:"Prejudice remains, both socially <small>(edit: <s>or</s>)</small> and legally, in most of the [[Islamic world]] against people who engage in homosexual acts."


Beyond a problem of a clear generalization being presented in regard to LGBT people not being "socially accepted", the issue here, that has already received a lengthy introduction in the previous two paragraphs, is one of prejudice. As the next sentence clearly demonstrates, the issue may frequently be a matter of life and death.

:"... In [[LGBT in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[LGBT rights in Brunei |Brunei]], [[LGBT rights in Iran|Iran]], [[LGBT rights in Mauritania|Mauritania]], [[LGBT rights in Nigeria|Nigeria]], [[LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], [[LGBT rights in Sudan|Sudan]] and [[LGBT rights in Yemen|Yemen]], homosexual activity carries the [[death penalty]]."

In other Wikipedia articles such as those on the treatment of Jews, gypsies and black people in WWII Germany, and article would not merely say that these people were "not ... accepted" not least because that would not be true.  Wikipedia even present: [[:Category:Rescue of Jews in the Holocaust]].  People in such circumstances were taken into homes, hidden, protected and certainly accepted.  In a similar way it seems to me that Wikipedia goes too far with its unsubstantiated claim that "homosexuality is not socially ... accepted" "in most of the [[Islamic world]]".  As with all similar issues, it depends on the extent of their prejudice of the people concerned.  

<small>I will leave a link to this thread at [[:WP:LGBT]] and [[:WP:Islam]] and Ping recent contributors to the article: {{u|Alexis Ivanov}}, {{u|AstroLynx}}, {{u|BethNaught}}, {{u|Bgwhite}}, {{u|BorgQueen}}, {{u|Chrisdike95}}, {{u|Contaldo80}}, {{u|Deisenbe}}, {{u|DMacks}}, {{u|Dialectric }}, {{u|Erodes43}}, {{u|Flyer22 Reborn}}, {{u|GermanJoe}}, {{u|GorgeCustersSabre }}, {{u|I dream of horses}}, {{u|Ibrahim Husain Meraj}}, {{u|Instantpancakes350}}, {{u|JCO312}}, {{u|Jeff5102}}, {{u|Lutipri}}, {{u|Maplestrip}}, {{u|Nematsadat}}, {{u|Nøkkenbuer}}, {{u|Philip Trueman}}, {{u|Rupert loup}}, {{u|Serols}}, {{u|Tadeusz Nowak}}, {{u|Talebhaq}}, {{u|Tymon.r}}, {{u|Winner 42}}</small>

== RFC regarding AAU subsection.  '''

There's an ongoing dispute over how to deal with an editorial argument in the subsection on the recent AAU report. Specifically, the section presents a statistic that most people who experienced a sexual assault who did not report the incident said that they did so because they "did not believe it was serious enough to report". It then presents this argument from an editorial by Stuart Taylor jr.: "Stuart Taylor, writing for the Washington Post, remarked "This most plausible explanation is that most of those classified by the survey as “victims” of sexual assault or rape did not really think that they had been sexually assaulted."" The question is over where/whether to include Taylor's comment, and over whether or not it is appropriate to note, in that section, statements from past research that challenge arguments similar to the one made by Taylor regarding the AAU study. A few solutions that have been proposed are:

*1. Leave the entry as is, or use a similar argument from a different editorial such as [http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2015/09/aau_campus_sexual_assault_survey_why_such_surveys_don_t_paint_an_accurate.2.html this one] by Emily Yoffe. 

*2. Move the quote and statistic to a separate subsection that addresses the causes of non-reporting, while also discussing past research on non-reporting, and the "not serious enough to report" response, and the criticisms voiced by people like Taylor.

*3. Leave Taylor's argument where it is, but also cite past research that disputes Taylor's argument within the AAU section.

Alright. This has gone on waaaaay too long, with no apparent progress. I'm going to try my hardest to present a fair and neutral introduction to this. Additionally, {{u|GoneIn60}} suggested above that any previous users in this discussion (myself included) should hold off on stating a position in this matter until some (hopefully) third party editors weigh in. With that out of the way, here we go.

The topic being discussed is "Should ''Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens'' appear as an alternate title in the lead in the following format: '''''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''''' (also known as '''''Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens''''') is a 2015 American..." Here is (to the best of my ability) the summaries of both positions, for '''not''' including, and including.

;Option 1 - Not including
* [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/star-wars-episode-vii-title-747060 On November 6, 2014, the official title of the film was revealed as ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'']. ''Episode VII'' is notably absent from the title.
* TheForce.net [http://www.theforce.net/story/front/Star_Wars_Episode_VII_Will_Be_Called_The_Force_Awakens_160763.asp received confirmation] from LucasFilm that (emphasis theirs) "'''"Episode VII" will not be in the title, but it will be in the opening crawl.''' The movie is officially titled ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''."
* The official Star Wars Twitter account [https://twitter.com/starwars/status/531980698190487552 tweets] the following response to a fan regarding not having "Episode VII" in the title: "The original trilogy never used the Episode number in the official title. We'll still be using it on the crawl. :)"
* The film's billing block is released on the official poster, with the title of the film, again, just ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''. A large version of the poster can be seen [http://a.dilcdn.com/bl/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/10/star-wars-force-awakens-official-poster.jpg here]. Note that [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/02/24/opinion/sunday/ben-schott-movies-billing-blocks.html billing blocks have very strict guidelines and legal ramifications] for their order and the formatting and inclusion of everything.
* ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'' both did not have the episode numbers in their titles, only being featured in the crawl as well. They are not also known by the titles ''Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'' until George Lucas rereleases them with these titles.
* The vast majority of sources do not use this title. And the very few that do, do not add enough weight at this time.
* The film will most likely be retitled with Episode VII in its title some where down the line (possibly even with its home media release) or in a rerelease with the other sequel trilogy films, or all 9. But as of "today" (ie the end of 2015), this is not the case.

;Option 2 - Including
* Consistency across the other episodic Star Wars films
* Before November 6, 2014, it was known simply as ''Star Wars Episode VII''
* It is featured in the crawl, which would thus make the title ''Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens'' valid, or at least an alternate to the actual title.
* There are reliable sources that include it in the title, albeit with different formattings.
**''Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens'' (supported by [http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_episode_vii_the_force_awakens/ RT], [http://www.metacritic.com/movie/star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens MC], and [http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-2015 RogerEbert.com])
**''Star Wars – Episode VII: The Force Awakens'' (supported by [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-star-wars-the-force-awakens-posters-revealed-20151104-htmlstory.html LATimes])
**''Star Wars, Episode VII: The Force Awakens'' (supported by [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/12/22/how-star-wars-episode-vii-the-force-awakens-missed-a-huge-opportunity/ WashingtonPost])
* ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' is only a marketing title
* It is shown as ''Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens'' [http://www.starwars.com/films on StarWars.com]

I believe that's it. Again, I did my very best to present both sides of the argument equally. If there is one side that does not have some of their points represented, let me know and I will adjust. I will also drop a neutral notices at the film project and some third party editors from the film project who I feel would provide some good comments to this discussion.

There is zero support for deleting old drafts. We should remove the entire concept of STALEDRAFTs.

*'''Conditional <s>support</s> oppose''' (Switch to oppose - apparently this does not apply only to stale draft deletions, as the [[Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion#G13_Drafts|concurrent discussion]] led me to infer.) This needs to be better worded, something like "Stale drafts not covered by CSD should not be deleted", but I understand the intention. My thinking leads me to support this, but the policy of deleting STALEDRAFTs can't have arisen for no reason. It would be very helpful if someone could supply the rationale for why MfD deletion is sometimes used instead of, for example, [[:Template:Userpage blanked]], which does not consume admin time and is friendlier for the author. Aren't the provisions for speedy deletion under G3, G4, G6, G10, G11, G12, and G13 sufficient for all conceivable cases in which deletion would be appropriate?

Does Wikipedia need reform? Please see [[Wikipedia:Reform of Wikipedia]] for ideas.

''' Background '''

Most of the time I edit an article there is conflict. For example, both anti-fringe editors and advocates take sides like a football [[WP:GAME]] and admins continue to ignore OR and other problems. The only way for change is for the rules to be consistently enforced, but that seems impossible under the current Wikipedia model.

Previously, we had an RfC which  asked,

:::'''to'''

:::'''Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, country of origin, or conclusions.'''

and the result of that RfC was, '''Yes'''. [[Wikipedia_talk:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)/Archive_19|The full result can be read here.]] In that close, the closer, Elvey made these points:

*# That, yes, a change is needed
*# There was consensus that "country of origin", per se, is not a valid reason to reject a source
*# Rejecting a source based on "country of origin" was no more valid than rejecting based on "funding sources"
*# That it should not be read as a PC ban where we cannot mention country of origin in discussions (see

*# That it should not be read as changing the longstanding policy that sources from publications known to routinely publish and fail to retract material proven unreliable may be excluded.

Implementing the plain language resulting from that RfC has, however, created more edit warring. There have been concerns that unreliable sources will make their way onto Wikipedia, but those concerns were already heard in the original RfC. Still, adding language to ensure that unreliable sources do not find their way onto Wikipedia may be necessary. Or it may not. This RfC seeks to resolve that by asking, based on the closer's 5 points, what version does it best? Of the versions that address all five points, these are proposed:

*# Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, country of origin, or conclusions.
*# Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, country of origin, or conclusions. However, sources from publications known to routinely publish and fail to retract material proven unreliable may be excluded.

Both of these options meet all five points, but I also ask the community for additional options '''that meet the five criteria outlined above''' and found in the original close. Please vote #1, #2 or an altogether different option below. [[User:LesVegas|LesVegas]] ([[User talk:LesVegas|talk]]) 18:49, 11 January 2016 (UTC)}}

The question is: '''should "seven days" mean the seventh day or 168 hours?'''

''' Closing comments '''

(To be filled out by closing administrator)

''' Background '''

The religion entry in infoboxes has been a contentious issue for many years, with multiple participants disputing what, if anything, should come after the "Religion = " entry. Previous discussions  and RfCs have made it abundantly clear that only actual religions should be listed, never anything that is a non-religion.

A [[Template talk:Infobox person/Archive 28#RfC: Religion infobox entries for individuals that have no religion|previous RfC]] determined that there is a clear consensus for removing the religion parameter for individuals (living, deceased, and fictional), groups, schools, institutions, and political parties hat have no religion, but that RfC was determined by the closing administrator to not apply to nations. A [[Template talk:Infobox country/Archive 11|follow-up RfC]] determined that the consensus was the same for nations, states, etc.

Despite the previous RfCs, we still have a problem with editors edit warring to keep various nonreligions in the religion entry, arguing that their favorite page is not covered by the existing RfCs. This [[WP:RfC|RfC]] is an attempt to create a bright line answer concerning exactly what the [[WP:CONSENSUS|consensus]] is concerning the religion entry for all infoboxes in all Wikipedia articles, without exception.

''' Examples '''

{{collapse top}}
Examples of religions: Baha'i, Baptist, Buddhist, Caodaist, Catholic, Christian, Confucianist, Hindu, Jain, Judaism, Latter Day Saint/Mormon, Lutheran, Muslim/Islam, Orthodox, Pentecostal, Presbyterian, Shamanist, Shiite, Shinto, Sikh, Sunni, Tao, Wicca. 

Examples of nonreligions: Agnostic, Antireligionist, Apatheist, Atheist, Communist, Ignosticist, Irreligion, Leninist, Marxist, NA, Non-practicing X, Nonbeliever, None, Nontheist, Raised as an X, Secularist, State atheism, Unknown.

("Jew/Jewish" is a special case. The word has several meanings, so the source cited needs to specify the Jewish religion, as opposed to someone who lives in Israel or has a Jewish mother.)

''' What this RfC is and is not '''

This RfC only applies to infoboxes, not to the body of the article.

This RfC only applies to the religion field of the infobox.

This RfC does not address whether the religion parameter should be changed to something else or omitted entirely from the template. 

This RfC does not change the existing strong consensus that religion in the infobox must be relevant (per the template guideline), supported by reliable sources, and covered in the body of the article.

''' Support / Oppose '''

'''Proposal: In all infoboxes in all Wikipedia articles, without exception, nonreligions should not be listed in the religion parameter ("Religion = ") of the infobox.''' 

* '''Support'''.  Didn't we already settle this in some other rfc?  For the same reasons as last time, I will support this.  It would be nice if we had an appropriate infobox parameter to summarize atheistic beliefs, but "religion = " is not the one.  For prominent atheism activists, such as Richard Dawkins, we can put "atheism activism" in "known for = ".  For others, their atheism is not a religion and shouldn't be treated as such.  If the question were, "Is this person religious?", then the answer could be "no".  But when the question is, "What religion is this person?", there's really no applicable answer for atheists.  We don't put "None (unmarried)" under "Spouse = " when someone is single. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 03:11, 3 January 2016 (UTC)}}

{{archive top|There is a remarkable degree of heat given that this is basically tabloid tittle-tattle. As Collect notes, agreement of various editors cannot trump policy: independent sources establish that the term is at least somewhat speculative, and even the subject of the claim appears not to have used it in the unambiguous sense supported by some editors here. The solution is to use [[WP:ATT|attribution]] and to take care not to exceed what is stated by the sources (e.g: "Mrs Gillespie was once the secret lover of Australian prime minister Harold Holt - or the alleged secret lover, as has frequently been recorded in the years following Holt's disappearance and prior to her own - as is reporting convention." from the Aus. Daily Telegraph). Terms such as "claimed lover" or "alleged lover" would not violate policy, an overt claim of "lover" probably does, from my reading of this debate, the sources and the relevant policies. And omitting it altogether? That would be perfect. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 13:13, 2 February 2016 (UTC)}}

When I originally created this article I used the term "rump militia" in lieu of "militia" (the specific term used by news sources) to provide just a basic level of clarification for our non-American readers that these were not governmental military units. "Rump militia" has wider historic, geographical usage as a term indicating non state-sanctioned paramilitary groups and is often specifically invoked in specialist and lay observer circles to refer to groups associated with the militia movement in the United States and differentiate from the [[National Guard]] and [[State Defense Forces]], the latter of which sometimes specifically also use the word "militia" in their names. Recently, IP editors have started changing this to "civilian militia" throughout the article, contending "rump militia" displays bias. What term should be used? 
* armed gang

* civilian Militia

There are a handful of instances where the shadowing of commons files is done deliberately, either as a placeholder to prevent poorly-named uploads (such as [[:File:Background.jpg]]), or because Commons has a bizarre picture for a simple name (i.e. the widely used [[:File:Otters.jpg]] which shadows [[:Commons:File:Otters.jpg]]). Nevertheless, these images are tagged with {{tl|ShadowsCommons}} and appear in [[:Category:Wikipedia files that shadow a file on Wikimedia Commons]] as backlog items to be cleared.

I propose that an optional parameter, <code>deliberate=</code> be added to {{tl|ShadowsCommons}}, which, if set to true, causes the template to note that no action is required and places the file in a new category [[:Category:Wikipedia files that shadow a file on Wikimedia Commons (no action required)]] (a subcat of the above) so that they can be distinguished from backlog items needing attention. --[[User:LukeSurl|LukeSurl]]<sup> [[User Talk:LukeSurl|t]] [[Special:Contributions/LukeSurl|c]]</sup> 17:58, 3 January 2016 (UTC)}}

the [[symmetry breaking]] of light is itself observation, which is relevant to my previous post:

space-time dictated by the uncertainty principle generates the multiverse which is an "infinitely" evolving fractal feedback loop(every-thing is a re-source from the singularity) through the quanta of all our minds which are folds/symmetry-breaks of/in space-time. our minds are themselves tachyon particles simply because we can visualize potential future states before the light of that event occurs in reality, if you believe multiverse theory you can reasonably assume that future state manifests in a parallel universe even if not in your own, our mind is a fold of spacetime where the purely abstract mathematical truth of a wave meets reality in the form of consciousness. necessarily the mind is also a superposition or 'entangled' with the 'abstract' uncertainty|certainty of the 'real' past|future, always obeying the uncertainty principle of information. through the uncertainty principle your mind is semi-randomly phase transitioning/symmetry breaking a novel worldline through the multiverse, helping to generate infinite complexity. perfect randomness is itself perfect infinity.

As the subtitle asks, should this article cover Exposing for the Highlights? Please read the above section before providing opinions. The IP editor appears to believe that any exposure in which the histogram reaches the right edge (without clipping) is a form of ETTR, even if the resultant image is underexposed. There are indeed (non-WP) articles online that make the same assertion, but they do not explain that underexposure negates the benefits of ETTR (in fact, having the ''opposite'' effects). Also, should the article explain that ETTR is not intended for high-DR scenes? Unfortunately I have not been able to provide good references for that, and even though it is self-evident with a little experimentation [[WP:OR|original research]] is not permitted on WP.

I think that this article should be moved to the title ''Meshblock'' or possibly ''Mesh Block''. Where an article is about something that can be both singular or plural a singular title is probably a better title. From what I can tell, the term '''meshblock''' is used by Statistics New Zealand, while the term '''Mesh Block''' is used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They have fairly similar definitions. The only articles that currently link to the article about ''[[Mesh blocks]]'' are all related to  Statistics New Zealand surveys. Also this article is ranked as a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_New_Zealand/Assessment#Importance_scale|mid-importance]] New Zealand article. Currently there are two(2) Wikipedia articles relating to Australia that use '''mesh blocks''' or '''Mesh Blocks'''. Also when it is used elsewhere it is usually written as a proper noun '''Mesh Block''', often as a pural, from Australian sources mostly concerning the Austrailan Census. However, there are at least ten(10) New Zealand related Wikipedia articles that contain '''Meshblock''' or '''Meshblocks'''. Elsewhere the term '''meshblock''' is dominated by material from New Zealand sources and while these are also generally related to the New Zealand Census, the breadth and scope of these sources are far wider than for Australia. There is no obvious evidence that ''meshblock'' or ''mesh block'' are used elsewhere in the world. Although other agencies may have a similar concept, they use different names and definitions. Considering this, my preferred title is '''[[Meshblock]]'''. At this stage I don't think there is a need for a separate '''Mesh Block''' article, as I suspect the Australian term has been borrowed from the New Zealand usage.

 I think the article should omit the the lists of individual anti-semitic incidents in order to be more encyclopedic and better fit my understanding of wikipedia standards. The issue is that Wikipedia is not a newspaper [[WP:NOTNP]] and this seems like a haphazard list of recent and not particularly noteworthy or historically significant anti-semitic incidents. Also see [[WP:RECENT]]. I think much of this content will not pass the ten-year test. Other editors seem to disagree with me, and it would be good to have some additional eyes on this. See above discussion under [[Talk:Antisemitism in_the_United_States#College_campuses_section_has_too_much_of_a_newspaper_quality_to_it]] although I think this same critique applies to lists of incidents outside the colleage campuses section.

For some time admins have been working in a limbo state where they are unblocking with conditions on further editing but don't have a policy basis to support them. This will be even more important now that the Arbitration Committee has handed block and ban appeals back to the community to deal with (note I'm proposing this as a community member not as an arb). I propose that the following be added as a section under the Unblocking section, the wording proposed has been discussed [[#Unblock conditions|above]] so that is probably useful reading for interested people.<b>[[User:Callanecc|Callanecc]]</b> ([[User talk:Callanecc|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Callanecc|contribs]] • [[Special:Log/Callanecc|logs]]) 07:37, 18 January 2016 (UTC)}}

I was going to post this but no one seems to check its talk page too much anymore so might as well post this here, and plus is this quite an notable issue. [http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog PHL] (some people call it by the project name HEC), once agian has reformated their listings of Habitable exoplanets, They have split the list into a "Conservative" and "Optimistic" lists which was well needed indeed. The formatting of PHL's lists is drastically different and included values that [[List of potentially habitable exoplanets]] doesn't list, and [[List of potentially habitable exoplanets]] lists values like SPH, HZC, and HZA which are no where to be found on the PHL's page (Some older archived lists from PHL used the HZD [http://phl.upr.edu/library/notes/latestlistofpotentialhabitableexoplanetsandexomoons (like this one)], but generally it has been replaced with Stellar flux Denoted as S<sub>E</sub>, S<sub>⊕</sub> or [http://www.drewexmachina.com/2015/12/19/habitable-planet-reality-check-wolf-1061/ S<sub>eff</sub>](<- See table 1 in that link) (But generally in Scientific papers S<sub>eff</sub> appears to be most commonly used) to critique planatary habitability (Just look at that link I just posted)). Not to mention so many KOI's that aren't on [http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog/data PHL's KOI List] which we do have [[List of Potentially Habitable Exoplanets Kepler Candidates|a better orginized list than this one]] that acctually has the ones that are there, plus some other ones that are backed by ''Nasa's Exoplanet Archive''. I'm thinking we should just redo the whole list from PHL's data as since there is no explanatory citation for any of the other units presented it must of all came from thin air. Another question that we have to answer is if we want a two separate tables (on the same page) for exoplanets in the "Conservative" HZ and "Optimistic" HZ or continue on with lumping all of them into one table or have all 3 tables on the same page or a sort of compromise which would be a single table, with some sort of sorter that would allow us to sort out "Optimistic" HZ planets and "Conservative" HZ planets. For the format of the table I nominate the PHL style format which can be seen in use [[List of Potentially Habitable Exoplanets Kepler Candidates|here]]. <span style="border:2px solid #090E0E;padding:0px;"><font style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#000000;">[[User:Davidbuddy9|Davidbuddy9]]</font>[[User talk:Davidbuddy9|<font style="color:#000000;background:#FFFFFF;">&nbsp;Talk&nbsp;</font>]] </span> 01:10, 9 January 2016 (UTC)}}

Should "[[Sugar Mama (Led Zeppelin song)]]" be merged with "[[Sugar Mama (song)]]"?  

"Sugar Mama" is a [[blues]] song that was recorded as early as 1934.  Although he did not record it until 1937, the song is often attributed to or associated with [[Sonny Boy Williamson I]] (Herzhaft, ''Encyclopedia of the Blues''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2CGNaUpGcbcC&pg=PA473&dq=sugar+mama+herzhaft&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjp1tKfqp3KAhVKbj4KHW9XCgcQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=sugar%20mama%20herzhaft&f=false)]).  It has been recorded by numerous artists, often with variations in the lyrics and music ([[Tampa Red]], [[Tommy McClennan]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[B.B. King]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Taste (band)|Taste]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], etc.) with credits to various songwriters.  

In 1969, during their recording sessions for ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', [[Led Zeppelin]] recorded a preliminary/demo "Sugar Mama" with somewhat different lyrics and arrangement.  The song was included on the expanded edition of ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]'' in 2013.  The album lists it as "Sugar Mama (Mix)" and is credited to "Page, Plant".

Two reliable sources have identified Sonny Boy Williamson as the source of LZ's version:
*"Sugar Mama: A cover of a Sonny Boy Williamson song recorded in June 1969 at Morgan Studios for ''Led Zepplin II''&nbsp;..." (Williamson, ''The Rough Guide to Led Zeppelin''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xR_upC_tDzUC&pg=PA213&dq=%22sugar+mama%22+%22zeppelin%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz--Sm-prKAhVBWWMKHcdhCnwQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=%22sugar%20mama%22%20%22zeppelin%22&f=false]).
*"the still unissued [by 2005] Zep version of Sonny Boy Williamson's 'Sugar Mama' from the ''Led Zeppelin II'' sessions&nbsp;..." (Shadwick, ''Led Zeppelin: The Story of a Band and Their Music, 1968-80''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KXF9sfBhIdoC&pg=PA319&dq=%22sugar+mama%22+%22zeppelin%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz--Sm-prKAhVBWWMKHcdhCnwQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&q=%22sugar%20mama%22%20%22zeppelin%22&f=false]).
A review of other Led Zeppelin biographies has not revealed that their song is a unique, original composition.

[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Songs]] provides the following guidance:
{{blockquote|When a song has renditions (recorded or performed) by more than one artist, discussion of a particular artist's rendition should be included in the song's article (never in a separate article), but only if at least one of the following applies:
:*the rendition is discussed by a reliable source on the subject of the song,
:*the rendition itself meets the notability requirement at [[WP:NSONGS]]. ([[WP:COVERSONG]])}}

{{rfcquote|text=
In the encyclopedia, the manual of style recommends the following with regards synonyms:
{{Quote frame|[...] the title can be followed in the first line by one or two alternative names in parentheses|[[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Lead_section#Usage in first sentence]]}}
{{Quote frame|Alternatively, if there are more than two alternative names, these names can be moved to and explained in a "Names" or "Etymology" section; it is recommended that this be done if there are at least three alternate names, or there is something notable about the names themselves. Once such a section or paragraph is created, the alternative English or foreign names should not be moved back to the first line|[[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Lead_section#Separate_section_usage]]}}

Medical conditions frequently have many synonyms (e.g. [[Burning mouth syndrome]]). 

The idea of including a list of synonyms in the infobox medical condition started on WT:MED (permalink here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Medicine&type=revision&diff=697421766&oldid=697421361]). James has kindly made a preview, seen here: [[Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome]]. Another idea for dealing with the list of synonyms is to have them as a footnote (e.g. [[geographic tongue]], this method discussed on WT:MED here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_75#List_of_synonyms_in_lead]).

If there is support for the above idea, then this raises other questions: should the list of synonyms replace entirely the list of synonyms in the lead, or elsewhere in the article? Or should the infobox be in addition to a list of synonyms in the lead or in a section within the article?

{{rfcquote|text=
There's an ongoing dispute over how to deal with an editorial argument in the subsection on the recent AAU report. Specifically, the section presents a statistic that most people who experienced a sexual assault who did not report the incident said that they did so because they "did not believe it was serious enough to report". It then presents this argument from an editorial by Stuart Taylor jr.: "Stuart Taylor, writing for the Washington Post, remarked "This most plausible explanation is that most of those classified by the survey as “victims” of sexual assault or rape did not really think that they had been sexually assaulted."" The question is over where/whether to include Taylor's comment, and over whether or not it is appropriate to note, in that section, statements from past research that challenge arguments similar to the one made by Taylor regarding the AAU study. A few solutions that have been proposed are:

*1. Leave the entry as is, or use a similar argument from a different editorial such as [http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2015/09/aau_campus_sexual_assault_survey_why_such_surveys_don_t_paint_an_accurate.2.html this one] by Emily Yoffe. 

*2. Move the quote and statistic to a separate subsection that addresses the causes of non-reporting, while also discussing past research on non-reporting, and the "not serious enough to report" response, and the criticisms voiced by people like Taylor.

*3. Leave Taylor's argument where it is, but also cite past research that disputes Taylor's argument within the AAU section.

I have debated beforehand that Muhammad is quite far from being 'widely considered' the founder of Islam, at least not by Muslims authors and society in general (which represent 1.6 billion people in the world). There are only a handful Muslims, mostly authors from the UK and Pakistan (non scholars of Islam) who consider him the 'founder of Islam' and I urge you to prove it otherwise; of all the sources found, most are from encyclopedias and books on terrorism, and a few from Christian authors. This induces a Christian POV into the text. I suggest removing the phrase, for the sake of the article itself. ''Note: Jesus is never considered the founder of Christianity, for example, since these people are considered prophets of religion and not founders, and whoever says otherwise is inadvertently adding a point of view which doesn't fit with the style of the text.'' --[[User:92slim|92slim]] ([[User talk:92slim|talk]]) 19:50, 29 January 2016 (UTC)}}

This RfC asks the participants to weigh in on how the photo which is claimed to depict Billy the Kid playing Croquet should be represented in the article - as an authentic photo or as a photo of disputed authenticity. This diff [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Billy_the_Kid&type=revision&diff=703130004&oldid=703048856] illustrate the type of changes that we are considering although the topic of the RfC are not these exact changes, but the general principle they illustrate - whether the most recent expert opinion by Kagin's inc and the National Geographic team can be considered to have established the authenticity beyond doubt, or whether the expressed doubts of historians (who wrote before Kagin inc's final conclusion) should still be considered to continue to throw doubt on the photo's authenticity. Participants are request to give their opinion about whether the photo should be described as '''authentic''' or as '''disputed''' within the article.


;Survey
*'''Disputed''' Several experts have provided their opinions about the authenticity of the photo - a number of experts argue that it is highly unlikely to be authentic, and one set of experts have examined the photo in 2015 and stated that they consider it authentic. Given the recency of these opinions it is still to be seen which of these claims will be adopted by historians of Billy the Kid. The stakes of claiming authenticity are very high as they raise the value of the photo in question from 2 dollars to 5 million dollars. So as to not inadvertently become a party in this issue the safest solution for Wikipedia and for our readers is to be conservative and note that the authenticity of the photo remains disputed - giving the opinions of experts from both sides without taking a final stance on the question. The matter of the photo's authenticity can always be revisited when historians evaluate the standing of the evidence on the matter in the future.

'''Summary (see version 1 for further text and references)'''



'''Prosection'''
Kosovo prosecution claims that Muhaxheri has traveled to Syria at two occasions between 2012- 2013 in a group of individuals from Kosovo, many of the members have been pointed out as students of imams at a mosque in Kosovo.The Kosovo prosecution have requested and been granted an international warrant for Muhaxheri’s arrest based on his affiliation with the group, which is affiliated  with Islamic State based on textmessages between Muhaxheri, an imam and other indicted members. The textmessages that Muhaxheri has obtained from the imam and other members include instructions related to recruitment, such as escorting recruited members between Syria and Turkey. The Kosovo prosecution has said that Muhaxheri didn’t participate in the fighting with the other indicted members of the group. Muhaxheri was last reported to be in Syria on 5 Oktober 2013, based on textmessages

'''Media coverage'''
There are media reports have claimed that  Muhaxheri appears in the following videos and footage; IS –propagandafilm Clanging of the Swords IV, an RPG – video, on beheading footage from Syria, a video from Iraq. 
There are media reports that have claimed that Muhaxheri has been killed in Syria and Iraq at three different occasions between 2014-2015. These reports have been denounced in other media reports that have claimed that publicized images and comments at IS militant Facebook accounts disconfirm  the reports of Muhaxheri’ s death.
In 2015 there are several media reports about Muhaxheri’s whereabouts that have been denounced by authorities; in November - December 2015 Muhaxheri was reported to be in Macedonia. This was denounced by Macedonian police department. In November 2015 Muhaxheri was  reported to be in Kacanik, Kosovo, the report was  denounced by Kosovo authorities. In December 2015 Muhaxheri was reported to be paralyzed in Syria, and later in December 2015 Muhaxheri was reported not to be paralyzed and to be in ar – Rutbah Iraq , on Muhaxheri was reported to be in Albania, this was denounced by an  Albanian International Affairs analyst due to unverifiabillity. 

'''Forensic and analyst opinions'''
The forensic anlazysts  of the published videos and footage alleged to be of Lavdrim Muhaxheri are not convinced that the footage is of the same individual and when and where the footage is taken. 

On IS –propagandafilm Clanging of the Swords IV;
According to Ebi Spahiu, a researcher at the Albanian Institute of International Affairs(AIIS);"he [Muhaxheri] would have come out with a stronger message".[1]

On RGP video
Researcher Ebi Spahiu stated that Muhaxheri was in the video but questioned whether it was new footage that proved he was still alive; "The media in Kosovo and Albania are treating it as a new video without considering that it may be old [footage]". Foreign policy analyst Adrian Shtuni stated that it was possible that the video was new footage, or at least newer than August 2014 but questioned whether Muhaxheri was in the video;"In a photograph of Muhaxheri taken around the summer of 2014, the militant appears to be heavier than he is in the video, although his outfit is the same", suggesting that the RPG video was taken at a different time than the two photographs. Foreign policy analyst Shtuni further claimed that it was possible that Muhaxheri was emulating other senior IS figures.

This source is simply not true.  [[Gene Roddenberry]] of [[Star Trek]] fame, had on-going disputes with the TV censors about navel exposure. In 1973 during the filming of Genesis II, he finally got even by giving [[Mariette Hartley]] with two navels - one her own, and a fake one.  In one of the Star Trek episodes in 1967, "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]", Uhura did show a navel, but it was missed by the censors - ten years before Cher's exposure...

Gene made several public statements about this issue (which I personally heard in person). Sources about the above statement:
*http://trekmovie.com/2009/10/02/roddenberrys-genesis-ii-and-planet-earth-coming-to-dvd/

There is only one photograph (actually, a [[daguerreotype]]) of Emily Dickinson which is known to exist. I'm arguing that the photograph should be used on her article with little to none modifications. I thought it would be wiser to ask others in the community to expose their ideas regarding the subject. My reasoning is quite simple: the version presently in use is small, heavily retouched, with grey tones, and of lesser quality. For me, it makes far more sense to use the original, unedited and with greater quality, version.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should ALL attacks by any organization labelled as a terrorist Organization and present in [[List of designated terrorist groups]] be called as "Terrorist" attacks as per the essay at [[WP:BLUE]] or should we bind editors to cite reliable sources for each attack. The arguments against this are that as per [[WP:BLUE]] essay we do not need to cite the obvious as they have been labelled as terrorist every attack made by them should be called terrorism. While the arguments against are that [[WP:Verifiability]] and [[WP:No original research]] are both policies and compliance with them is not optional and that these organizations attack a plethora of targets from other terrorists to common civilians, so we should wait until an RS calls something a terrorist attack before including it. The two options being given through this RFC are
# Every Incident included here should be sourced to a [[WP:RS]] which calls it a terrorist incident. There is a strong need to cite [[WP:RS]] which uses the word terrorist incident or its synonyms. e-g An attack by [[Taliban]] anywhere in the world will be included only when a reliable source calls it a terrorist attack. TLDR '''both "Islamist" and "terrorist" must be explicitly cited in RS as motivations for the attack to be included on the list '''
# Any terrorist attack by an organization labelled as a terrorist organization should be included. There is no need to cite any reliable source which labels this as a terrorist attack as these organizations have already been labelled terrorists by [[WP:RS]] the essay allowing this is [[WP:BLUE]]. e.g [[Taliban]] are terrorists, therefore any attack by them, whether in Afghanistan to capture new bases from another terrorist organization, or on civilians in Pakistan, is terrorism and should be included here as per [[WP:BLUE]]. TLDR '''any attack described in RS by a designated terrorist group adhering to Islamist ideology should be included on this list'''
Please vote with '''Option one(1)''' or '''Option(2)'''   [[User:FreeatlastChitchat|FreeatlastChitchat]] ([[User talk:FreeatlastChitchat|talk]]) 06:58, 18 January 2016 (UTC)}}

There is a suggestion to clarify the way privy counsellors are identified in opening sentences and infoboxes. Currently the most common method is to add the "Rt Hon" prefix for people who are not peers, and the "Rt Hon" prefix and "PC" suffix for peers who are privy counsellors. Peers who are not privy counsellors are given the title "Rt Hon" only. There are various suggestions for how these prefixes and suffixes should be used.

{{rfcquote|text=
I am requesting comments on the proposal that we '''eliminate production codes''' from all lists of episodes, as well as [[Template:Episode table]], [[Template:Episode list]], and similar templates.

My reasons for this proposal are that:
# The vast majority are unsourced or poorly sourced (often model sheets from Tumblr)
# They add little information and are arguably fancruft
# They are common magnets for editing disputes and sneaky vandalism

Episode number of airdate should be enough information for the tables. Order can be determined per series if there are large differences between DVD orders and airdates.

The only value to them that I am aware of is that they may indicate that episodes were aired in a different order than intended by the writers. This is often trivial and any non-trivial instances could easily by mentioned and sourced in a note either in the plot summary or as a footnote.

I have no problem with well-sourced production codes on individual episode articles as this seems like a more appropriate place for such detailed information. But on a list of episodes it seems to cause more problems than the information added warrants. 

I chose an RFC for this discussion because there have been past discussions on this issue with few comments and no real outcomes. Please see [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Television/Episode_lists/Archive_1#I.27m_interested|2006]], [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Television/Archive_11#Request_for_Comments:_Production_codes|2009]], [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Television/Archive_15#What_is_the_correct_way_to_order_episodes.3F|2012]], [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Television/Archive_16#DVD_order_or_broadcast_order.3F|2012 (detailed discussion of issue)]], [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Television/Archive_18#Production_Code|2014]], and [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Television/Archive_20#Production_codes_and_A.2FB_carts|2015]] for past discussions of production codes on this project's talk page.

'''Summary (see version 1 for further text and references)'''



'''Prosection'''
Kosovo prosecution claims that Muhaxheri has traveled to Syria at two occasions between 2012- 2013 in a group of individuals from Kosovo, many of the members have been pointed out as students of imams at a mosque in Kosovo.The Kosovo prosecution have requested and been granted an international warrant for Muhaxheri’s arrest based on his affiliation with the group, which is affiliated  with Islamic State based on textmessages between Muhaxheri, an imam and other indicted members. The textmessages that Muhaxheri has obtained from the imam and other members include instructions related to recruitment, such as escorting recruited members between Syria and Turkey. The Kosovo prosecution has said that Muhaxheri didn’t participate in the fighting with the other indicted members of the group. Muhaxheri was last reported to be in Syria on 5 Oktober 2013, based on textmessages

'''Media coverage'''
There are media reports have claimed that  Muhaxheri appears in the following videos and footage; IS –propagandafilm Clanging of the Swords IV, an RPG – video, on beheading footage from Syria, a video from Iraq. 
There are media reports that have claimed that Muhaxheri has been killed in Syria and Iraq at three different occasions between 2014-2015. These reports have been denounced in other media reports that have claimed that publicized images and comments at IS militant Facebook accounts disconfirm  the reports of Muhaxheri’ s death.
In 2015 there are several media reports about Muhaxheri’s whereabouts that have been denounced by authorities; in November - December 2015 Muhaxheri was reported to be in Macedonia. This was denounced by Macedonian police department. In November 2015 Muhaxheri was  reported to be in Kacanik, Kosovo, the report was  denounced by Kosovo authorities. In December 2015 Muhaxheri was reported to be paralyzed in Syria, and later in December 2015 Muhaxheri was reported not to be paralyzed and to be in ar – Rutbah Iraq , on Muhaxheri was reported to be in Albania, this was denounced by an  Albanian International Affairs analyst due to unverifiabillity. 

'''Forensic and analyst opinions'''
The forensic anlazysts  of the published videos and footage alleged to be of Lavdrim Muhaxheri are not convinced that the footage is of the same individual and when and where the footage is taken. 

On IS –propagandafilm Clanging of the Swords IV;
According to Ebi Spahiu, a researcher at the Albanian Institute of International Affairs(AIIS);"he [Muhaxheri] would have come out with a stronger message".[1]

On RGP video
Researcher Ebi Spahiu stated that Muhaxheri was in the video but questioned whether it was new footage that proved he was still alive; "The media in Kosovo and Albania are treating it as a new video without considering that it may be old [footage]". Foreign policy analyst Adrian Shtuni stated that it was possible that the video was new footage, or at least newer than August 2014 but questioned whether Muhaxheri was in the video;"In a photograph of Muhaxheri taken around the summer of 2014, the militant appears to be heavier than he is in the video, although his outfit is the same", suggesting that the RPG video was taken at a different time than the two photographs. Foreign policy analyst Shtuni further claimed that it was possible that Muhaxheri was emulating other senior IS figures.

How should we word the lede? From that follows, what should the criteria be for inclusion into this table? Let's try to have a single discussion section.

''' Only validated claims '''

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_oldest_living_people&direction=next&oldid=700309171 This version] which is "This is a partial list of the oldest living people in the world in ordinal ranks. In this table, a supercentenarian is considered 'verified' if his or her claim has been validated by an international body that specifically deals in longevity research, such as the Gerontology Research Group (GRG) or Guinness World Records (GWR)."

* '''Support''' This version reflects the scientific consensus on the subject - that claims are subject to error and exaggeration and therefore a competent body is needed to assess claims. Most major news organizations routinely defer to the expertise of GRG or GWR in claims of extreme age, and wikipedia should reflect that general consensus in the need for longevity arbiters. Though, I would slightly amend the "partial list" phrase as though there are likely more unverified or unverifiable super-c's out there, we, by definition, don't know that for a fact. Reinstating the "unverified" lists would allow us to have a greater idea of other claims which may be true.

The current chronology of the Bach Legacy section is arbitrarily organized by century markers like 1800, 1900, 2000, etc, rather than specific important dates directly relevant to the Bach Legacy section. Another RfC (see above on Talk page) has identified that the dates of 1788 (the death of Bach's son), and 1829 (the date of the Mendelssohn Bach revival) are of heightened importance to understanding the Bach Legacy as a whole. Bach's two composer sons (died 1784 and 1788, respectively) inherited many of Bach composition manuscripts and influenced their dispostion during their lives. Mendelssohn worked extensively to revive Bach's reputation between 1824-1829 with the revived performance of Bach's Matthew Passion in Germany in 1829. The dates in the Bach chronology should reflect this in a new and enhanced outline covering first, '''1750-1788''', followed by '''1789-1829''', followed by '''1830-1899''', leaving the rest of the section unchanged at this time. This RfC is to determine SUPPORT or OPPOSE for the enhanced specification of the important dates over and against the use of arbitrary century markers currently used in the Bach Legacy section.

I think there needs to be a discussion of Sanders' Party affiliation/s - BOTH in the infobox AND in its own section on the page.  For my entire life I have known one thing about Sanders - that he was neither a Democrat nor a Republican.  It was like knowing that Buchanan was a bachelor, or that Andy Jackson  served a giant cheese. It made them unique.  Except, the Jackson cheese was not as trivial as it sounds.  His administration truly did mark a transition from a government by "gentlemen of property and standing", to a more egalitarian government. We need to address this extremely distinctive and meaningful fact about Sanders: That was and is famous for being neither [[Republican Party (United States)|elephant]] nor [[Democratic Party (United States)|donkey]].  The page needs to put the facts about his unique attitude towards Party in a subsection and on the infobox.  What was he and when? And why?

I had [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eminem&type=revision&diff=700993825&oldid=700811385 recently added] about the death of Dawn Scott to the article. Dawn Scott is the biological mother of Eminem's adopted daughter Alaina and&nbsp;twin sister of his ex-wife Kim Scott. However [[User:SNUGGUMS|SNUGGUMS]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eminem&type=revision&diff=700994316&oldid=700993825 removed] the details of her death. I readded it but he removed them again. His reasons for not letting it add are that she isn't her family member as Eminem had divorced with Kim, details of her death are [[WP:UNDUE]] or [[WP:Out of scope]] of the article and this is not an article about Dawn or Kim or Scott family. Also he [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eminem&action=historysubmit&type=revision&diff=701014024&oldid=701008999 removed] about a sub-section of [[Proof (rapper)|Proof's]] death of the the "''Personal life''" section from the article even though the section was more about how Eminem responded to his death. I however [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eminem&type=revision&diff=701021640&oldid=701014024 reverted] his edit. Proof was the best friend of Eminem and associated musically as he was member of his musical group [[D12]]. SNUGGUMS has cited some of the same reasons for removing the section of his death: it is WP:Out of scope or WP:UNDUE, this isn't an article about Proof and the info about songs of Eminem's album [[Recovery (album)|Recovery]] dedicated to Proof should be in the article about that album.

My reason for keeping the details about both Proof and Dawn's deaths are that I think their deaths are relevant and DUE to the article as both of them were closely related to Eminem, the subject of this article and I don't think there's any policy that at least explicitly prohibits from adding about their deaths. Dawn Scott is especially very closely related as I've already said she us biological mother of Eminem's daughter and ex-sister-in-law. Also I &nbsp;had cited another reason to SNUGGUMS about adding details of her death, I gave the example of [[El Chapo]] article where deaths and arrests of El Chapo's family members and ex-wives are mentioned. So atleast Dawn's death should be mentioned. However SNUGGUMS refuses this saying we don't have to go by what's done [[WP:OTHERSTUFF|OTHERSTUFF]].&nbsp;Proof was best friend and member of Eminem's music group D12. Additionally as I already said the sub-section about Proof's death was more about Eminem's reaction to Proof's death.&nbsp;

This issue seems complex to me and the discussion between us two basically kept going back-and-forth over the same thing. I offered to reduce the amount of details to just one sentence "On January 19, 2016, Dawn died, apparently due to heroin overdose". However he didn't agree. The discussion has ended up going nowhere and that's why I've created this RfC in order to receive input of others including those who haven't been involved with others. Additionally, I think this might also serve as an example if what to do in similar cases.&nbsp;

So my question is: Do you think the deaths of Proof and Dawn Scott should be added to the article? And if yes then in what form? [[User:KahnJohn27|KahnJohn27]] ([[User talk:KahnJohn27|talk]]) 03:46, 22 January 2016 (UTC)}}

I see that once again nothing has changed. I would like to ask [[User:Srnec|Srnec]] and [[User:GermanJoe|GermanJoe]], is there ''any'' compromise you would agree with? Do you understand the concerns of people here? We have long tried to find a common ground in either a split, a merge, a move or even a delete, but there is no way we will achieve consensus without some willingness from your side. The issue is clear: the "Kingdom of Germany" is virtually unknown in English. Try [https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#q=%22Kingdom+of+Germany%22+-Wikipedia&es_th=1 a google search] and you will find no such thing as the article describes. In all fairness, it's a rough (mis)translation of a specific German term (Deutsches Reich) with heavy implications. What takes the cake here is that even long after this period of time the English still referred to the entire Mid-Germanic region as ''Dutch''. I simply can't comprehend why this article name would suit it. The only real obstable to a consensus so far is that we can not decide on ''what'' to move/rename it to. I'm asking you (and others) to reach out here, since plenty of people on the talk page have long voiced their disagreement with the current status of the article. You two have been active in these discussions and so invariably play a part in what comes next. I have no doubt of your good intentions and commitment, which is why I'm reopening this with a Request for Consensus on how to deal with the matter at hand. 

I don't want to be the one to keep pushing this though. If nothing comes from it or consensus decides that it should remain the same, I will of course agree with this decision.

These simple and short ten phrases / measures succinctly summarize the aim of the manifesto's effort ( they are listed in the above section ).  They speak volumes in addressing the changes Marx and Engels wrote about ( the rest of the manifesto ).  The general public would best be served if allowed to read and identify these ten measures. This would assist the reader in understanding what Marx and Engel's aims / demands were.  Since the Wikipedia effort is providing an encyclopedia where the common person can find decent citations and concise information when conducting research for school, work, or the like, not having these ten measures included in the article would be a disservice to those searching Wikipedia for highlighted and summarized information.  When has any manifesto not been known to have a list of demands?  Not having the list of demands of the Communist Manifesto in this wiki entry neuters the article.

Regarding the manner in which this objection is being voiced:

I've found the manner in which I've been treated quite discouraging in furthering the wiki effort.  Two individuals are calling "consensus" when only three ( myself and them two ) have opined recently on this particular matter and article.  Not sure if one of them is a WP:SOCK, but further discussion may make this entire matter clearer and show motive in obstructing the simple addition of the ten measures.  I expressed my concern when my edit was removed several months ago when one of these individuals took it upon themselves to conduct an entire rewrite of the article.  I didn't object and let them continue without issue.  That effort did affect the [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest90/The_Communist_Manifesto statistics of readership] of the article.  I applaud the effort of this person in editing, but again, not including what is so simple and concise as those ten measures is like not including water when trying to make soup.  They initially desired to assist in including the ten measures, then chose against them, which I found quite odd.  One could review the editing history and the dialogue at my talk page for clarity and the dubiousness of the editor who rewrote the entire article and now acts as the article's co-manager. --[[User:HafizHanif|HafizHanif]] ([[User talk:HafizHanif|talk]]) 00:15, 25 January 2016 (UTC)}}

Which of the sources should be kept and which should be removed? A detailed analysis of sources and the concerns about them is found one section above. Given below is a short summary of each source and the concern raised.
# The first source "The Prophet Jesus (as) and Hazrat Mahdi (as) Will Come This Century" is by [[Adnan Oktar]] who is a conspiracy theorist. [[WP:FRINGE]] is violated here. 
# There are two references to the Quran. the article is about [Hadith]. Including the references to Quran is [[WP:COATRACK]]. 
# Source four is Sahih Bukhari, one quote is enough more than that and [[WP:QUOTEFARM]]. 
# Source five is a hate book written by Akhtar Rizvi. The proof that this book is a hate book is that it uses the hate word "[[Qadiani]]". A simple analogy is that a book which uses the word "Dirty niggers" throughout the book "will not" be used as a scholarly source in African American Articles. Same is the case with books using "Kike" not being used as scholarly sources in "Semitic" articles. 
# Sources six and Seven are once again Primary sources from which information has been cherry picked through [[WP:OR]].
# Source number eight is "Nuzool Isa Ibn Maryam Akhir al-Zaman" written by Jalaluddin al-Suyuti. It is un available on the internet in any form. When we try to search for this book in google books, to see if "any OTHER scholar" has quoted Suyuti's opinion, we come up empty handed. Only "Religious Polemics in Context: Papers Presented to the Second International Conference of the Leiden Institute for the Study of Religions (Lisor) Held at Leiden, 27-28 April, 2000" and "THE BIOGRAPHIES OF THE ELITE LIVES OF THE SCHOLARS, IMAMS & HADITH MASTERS: Biographies of The Imams & Scholars" have the name of this book in their index, and both of them refrain from giving any quotes etc. So even though this "may well" be a reliable book, up till now I am having trouble ascertaining whether it is even a real book or not. 
# Source number ten is "Ibn Hajar al-Haytami's book Al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah", which discusses how a marriage was arranged and discusses Ahl-al-Bayat, and nothing is said about Jesus.
# Source number 11 is "Fara'id al-Simtayn. p. 43". Imam Mahdi and Jesus have not been mentioned by this source. So again, source misrepresentation, or something like that.
# Source 12 is again the same dubious book by Suyuti under a different name. Already discussed.
# The last source is a "Shi'ite encyclopedia"; a HUGE book and no reference has been given.
Those who comment here can format their comments into two options if they like. They can use a bullet list to make two sentences like this
* "source 1,2,3,4.....is bad and should be removed"
* "source 5,6,7,8.....is good and should be kept"

I am in favour of altering it to [[far-right politics|Far-right]] due to the fact that: <br>
* It is well known in the article that much of the content is derogatory towards U.S minorities (esp. Jews and African-Americans) which would earn itself both the Neo-nazi and white supremacist designation <br>
* Both Neo-Nazism and the belief in white supremacy are well established Far-right ideologies <ref>Hilliard, Robert L. and Michael C.

* In terms of [[WP:NPOV]], 'Far-right' sounds more balanced and even-sided
* The sites author's opinion should be taken into account to maintain [[WP:DUE]]. Even the reliable sources cited above in point 2 attest to the current designations of 'Neo-Nazi' and 'White supremacy' as being Far-right.

It's important to note that many of the secondary sources used to define this article will have an inherent bias due to not being objective Encyclopedia's like Wikipedia, but rather blogs, news sites etc. --[[User:Ritsaiph|Ritsaiph]] ([[User talk:Ritsaiph|talk]]) 04:42, 25 January 2016 (UTC)}}

The following wording [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Images&oldid=699751350#Size used to be in the guideline]: "As a general rule, images should not be set to a larger fixed size than the 220px default (users can adjust this in their [[m:Help:Preferences|preferences]]). If an exception to the general rule is warranted, forcing an image size to be either larger or smaller than the 220px default is done by placing a parameter in the image coding." The guideline currently looks like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Images&oldid=701619620#Size this]. Above on the guideline talk page, there is concern that the "As a general rule" wording is limited, and that we shouldn't assume that all readers keep their default size set at 220px; assuming such can lead people to use improper image settings. There is also concern that there are few cases where an image needs to be above the 220px setting, and that the 220px rule has kept unreasonable image sizes at bay and settled disputes over image size for years.

Two issues:
# The article was recently edited to include these fully referenced claims: (I) "''which, according to Mitsubishi's general manager of the medium class car project group, Shunji Takeshita, was built as a "luxury car [...] designed to compete with BMW''" and (II) "[engine noise] ''was described by automotive journalists as being "reminiscent of a BMW six''".
# For over 1 year, fully referenced [[Recommended retail price]]s for each series and each model of this car, have been part of this article.

FIRST ISSUE: Given a [[WP:POV]] dispute started by a user finding the above claims "false" (note: there are no third-party sources supporting this), are these fully referenced quotations unfit for inclusion, considering the many direct supportive sources found? See above discussion [[Talk:Mitsubishi Magna#Comparisons]] above for more.

SECOND ISSUE: The same user disputing the above referenced quotations has attempted to delete prices (in what can only be described as an act of retaliation given he contributed to this information being left in the article). Noting that WP:NOPRICES is not definitive, this car is no longer for sale new (eliminating any misuse of Wiki as a sales catalogue), the prices are all fully referenced to the same point in time (i.e. at the launch of each new series), and price was a key factor of the success and failure of this car, should they be deleted?

The UK study which is being pushed by [[User:Mattnad|Mattnad]] is a somewhat flimsy primary source that may not belong at all. But I'm also a bit perturbed by edits like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Campus_sexual_assault&diff=701631860&oldid=701631693 this] by [[User:Nblund|Nblund]]. While the edit summary is accurate in a sense - this particular source doesn't make the specific claim that the BJS criteria were narrower - we also all know this claim to be true, and it can be sourced elsewhere. On both sides, there is an effort to control almost every word in this article, which is going to preclude it from being developed. I would suggest you stop arguing over these small issues and instead open a (hopefully friendlier) discussion about how to significantly restructure the article. It needs work one way or another. --[[User:Sammy1339|Sammy1339]] ([[User talk:Sammy1339|talk]]) 04:47, 27 January 2016 (UTC)}}

This Rfc asks how the article should describe the Maya calendar, in terms of the number of ''piktun'' cycles in a '. 
Should we 
:A. Describe the Maya calendar system as uniformly using 20 piktuns per kalabtun? (Sources include: )
or should we 
:B. Mention that some inscriptions use seem to 13 baktuns in the previous piktun and 13 piktuns in the current kalabtun? (Sources for this include Sharer & Traxler, Van Stone 2011, Stuart 2011 (also [https://decipherment.wordpress.com/category/reflections/], Carter 2014)

;Survey:
*'''B'''. Three major specialist sources describe how some inscriptions clock over after 13 piktuns (at least forthe piktun from 3114BCE to 2012CE). Van Stone specifically argues that this is because of local variation in how the larger cycles are counted.  That is enough that we need to include this view. Describing it as if the Maya uniformly used the base 20 clock for the higher order cycles would be false. I propose using the following text to describe this:" The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 or 13 bak'tuns. Specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the bak'tun cycle that ended in 3114 BCE had only 13 bak'tuns, which means that the current piktun cycle is exceptional in containing 13 + 20 bak'tun. There may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed."[[User:Maunus|·maunus]] · [[User talk:Maunus|snunɐɯ·]] 18:31, 8 February 2016 (UTC)}}

I assert that the article [[Climate change denial]] is unencyclopedic and does not comply with [[WP:NPOV]]. Reasons:
* The style of writing is not neutral but is condemnatory of climate change sceptics/deniers
* There is POV-pushing, e.g. in the use of "unwarranted doubt" rather than just "doubt"
* The section "Pseudoscience" is inappropriate. It is not pseudoscience to hold an opinion on climate change which differs from the majority opinion

I suggest two possible remedies:
* The article should be re-written in a neutral style, or
* The title should be changed to [[Criticism of climate change denial]]

<s>I also criticise the fact that [[Climate change skeptics]] redirects here. Climate change skepticism is not the same as climate change denial, although this article pushes the POV that they are the same.</s>

If the existing system of international relations, international law and the checks and balances in place got in the way of these aims, this system was declared worthless, outdated and in need of immediate demolition."<ref name=Vald>[http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/23137 Meeting of the Valdai International Discussion Club] October 24, 2014.</ref></blockquote>

Following this unrest, Russia conducted a [[2014–16 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|covert invasion]] of parts of Ukraine, sparking an [[2014 Crimean crisis|international crisis]]. In March 2014, the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] held the [[Crimean status referendum, 2014|referendum]], thereby declaring its [[secession]] from Ukraine, and shortly thereafter signed a treaty to [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|join]] the Russian Federation. The annexation was [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation#International response|not recognized]] by the overwhelming majority of the world community and provoked the imposition on 17 March 2014 of the [[International sanctions during the 2013–15 Ukrainian crisis#First round of sanctions|first round of sanctions]] against Russia by Canada, the United States, and the European Union.

The term "Cold War II" gained currency and relevance as tensions between Russia and the West escalated throughout the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]] followed by the [[2014–16 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|Russian military intervention]] and especially the downing of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] in July 2014. By August 2014, both sides had implemented economic, financial, and diplomatic sanctions upon each other: virtually all Western countries, led by the US and EU, imposed [[International sanctions during the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|restrictive measures]] on Russia; the latter reciprocally introduced retaliatory [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis#Sanctions by Russia|measures]].

{{rfcquote|text=
Hello, it is as a consequence of a derailed discussion on a talk page [[Talk:Mitsubishi Magna|this one]], that I commence this one here. In a nutshell (I hope):
* WP:NOPRICES or WP:PRICES is clearly neither definitive nor compulsory, in omitting price information from articles
* the present case arises because, in an Australian car article ([[Mitsubishi Magna]]), for some 1.5 years, [[recommended retail price]]s have been included without any opposition by any of the regular editors 
* opposition has been (improperly?) raised of late by a regular editor (OSX) only in retaliation for a separate discussion not going his way (which involved both me and him)
* in 2014, a discussion went against the inclusion of prices, with reasons including: (i) a lack of reference; (ii) price flactuations over time; (iii) the potential for car dealers to spam; (iv) the potential misuse of the article as a sales catalogue (note: the originating RfC has also been compromised by an offensive participant to the 2014 discussion, Mr.choppers, claiming that it was all done and dusted 2 years ago)
* to address, or in answer to, the above valid points: (i) full reliable external references have been found and included, from Australian car magazines; (ii) the prices included, for each series of the car over a period of 10 years, have strictly been only those listed at the time of launch of each car thus eliminating the issue of price flactuations; (iii) the car has out of production for over 10 years; (iv) by being only prices at launch, it ensures that "special" or "discounted" prices are not included... and a car is not an insignificant household good, which renders its price a key factor for consumers
* the launch prices have been included in such a manner that they do not render the article illegible (prices are included in brackets, against each model variant, where these are listed)
* other car articles (and I am aware this is not a basis for inclusion) also contain prices, without reason or context, let alone full references unlike the above case
* in the above case, prices were a determinative factor of the car's success (in terms of competition and winning Car of the Year awards) and failure against other Australian-made cars
* in the manner in which prices have been included, it is possible (for those who may choose to do so), to carry out trend analysis of new car prices in Australia, which, in the case of this car, spans a period of 20 years (such analysis may seem trivial and I do not profess the following being a determinative crucial point, however, come 2017, no more Australian cars will be manufactured, so prices have the potential of being an important historical fact in future relative to imports)
** ''AN ALTERNATIVE'': could the fully referenced prices perhaps instead exist in a table, which lists all series, models and variants of this car, if it is a case of readibility?
All in all, is opposition to the inclusion of prices in the above case, proper? Does the non-descriptive and non-compulsory WP:PRICES really give basis to delete this carefully searched and referenced information? As mentioned, I am forcedly resorting to starting this discussion here, because of the derailed RfC on the relevant Talk Page (and other retaliatory actions against me, including being subject of a sockpuppet investigation, which I have no qualms highlighting, unlike the opposing editor's practice of oppressing and/or contorting facts—as I have complained about in the sockpuppet report—and deleting warnings from his Talk Page).<br>
'''Above all''', I raise this discussion here with a view to encourage/seek more more definitive and/or prescriptive guidance on this WP... it isn't helpful that it is so inconclusive, causing the above type of arguments to arise.<br>
I am '''not''' requesting or suggesting that this Policy be varied to allow prices for ''all'' consumer goods, but a car is typically a major purchase for most people, with price being a key factor in consumer choice. I argue for price inclusion, only if fully referenced and as it applied at a specific point in time (the most practical, if not logical, being the time of launch of the car or last listed price).

{{rfcquote|text=
 How should the second paragraph of the overview section begin [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mainline421/sandbox#Overview in this draft] begin? Disagreement has arisen over how this paragraph should begin, this mainly stems from whether or not Grand Theft Auto V was developed in parallel for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] as it is argued is confirmed by these articles: [http://www.pcgamer.com/gta-5-bug-log-lists-pc-version-and-directx-11-effects/ GTA 5 bug log lists PC version and DirectX 11 effects], [http://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-talk-4k-pc-performance-and-more/ Rockstar talk 4K, PC performance and more], and [http://www.gamesradar.com/gta-5-pc-why-evidence-too-strong-ignore/ GTA 5 on PC - why the evidence is too strong to ignore] however, it is also argued that this quote from the second article contradicts this:
{{Talkquote|"While we started development of the PC version quite early, we decided to focus the bulk of our attention on the PS3 and XB360 versions first in order to push that as far as we possibly could before turning our attention to the PS4 and Xbox One versions, and then using the shared architecture underpinning the new consoles to help ourselves ramp up into the PC version and push the game as far as we possibly could knowing we would have the opportunity to make the game look and feel better than it ever has."}}
while it has also been said that this merely a matter of interpretation and that this does not contradict the other sources. The reliance of a leaked bug log for the claims that development was in parallel have been criticized as well, this been contended with the fact that the bug log is present on the PlayStation 3 disk, and it has therefore been argued it is part of the product and not leaked or rumour. All the above articles meet [[WP:VG/RS]] and two are from the same publication. [[WP:Synthesis]] and [[WP:Inaccuracy]] are both relevant here. 23:33, 30 January 2016 (UTC)}}

I really think we need more input regarding the images used on this article.

I propose that we pool our collective opinions here and put things to a vote. Since there are 2 questionable images I'll split this into 2 subsections.

'''Artist's impression in the infobox'''

[[File:Planet-Nine-in-Outer-Space-artistic-depiction.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's impression of Planet Nine]]
The infobox currently shows an artist's impression of Planet Nine (right), which appears to be closely based on [http://www.caltech.edu/news/caltech-researchers-find-evidence-real-ninth-planet-49523 an image released by Caltech credited to R. Hurt (IPAC)]. While artist's impressions may help to grab the reader's attention I do not think that it's becoming of an encyclopedia to reproduce them here and I propose that it be removed, or at the very least removed from the infobox. The only information it conveys are ''basic assumptions'', which could easily mislead the reader. [https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@21.854703,-45.6376436,22971116m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en A view of the Earth can be found here] in which the planet's size and distance from the Sun is similarly ''not'' conveyed. Please bear in mind that even if you don't find the picture misleading, others undoubtedly will.

The Wikipedia Manual of Style does not currently have any solid guidelines on how to capitalise trademarks with multiple capital letters, such as 'tvOS', 'watchOS', 'webOS', etc. The only guidelines I can find currently are: 
* [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Use commonly recognizable names]],
* [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Article titles]],
* [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Trademarks]] and
* [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Trademarks#Trademarks that begin with a lowercase letter]].
Editors are divided over which forms to use, e.g. whether to use 'exampleOS', 'ExampleOS' or 'EXAMPLEOS' and whether to use different forms at the start of sentences, etc. The Manual of Style needs some guideline to use because the current ones do not give a rule to follow for this situation.

I am proposing that this article should be '''deleted''' as we currently have two other articles that already cover records for the most important time periods in tennis history from the beginning in 1877 and from 1968 .

* [[Overall tennis records – Men's Singles]] > covers entire period of tennis records (1877 onward) 
* [[Tennis records of the Open Era – men's singles]] > covers Open Era records (1968 onward)

This article covers the period from 1972 onward when the ATP came into existence however the men's tour was officially known as the [[Grand Prix tennis circuit]] from 1970 to 1989. The original discussion about this articles scope was outlined by [[User:Wolbo]] in which he stated. "At the time I was not greatly enthusiastic about the creation of [[Tennis records of the Open Era – men's singles]] given the apparent overlap with this article and the additional effort required to maintain both. Now that both articles exist side-by-side and share about 90% of the content it makes sense to evaluate the scope of these articles. The scope of this article, especially with its current name, is not always clear and can be interpreted to mean either:

A. all records since the creation of the ATP (September 1972)<br>
B. all records which are recognized and listed by the ATP (on their website)<br> 
C. all records since the creation of the ATP Tour (in 1990) or the ATP World Tour (in 2009)<br> 

This ambiguity leads to occasional confusion and edit warring. The current situation, with one article covering the entire history and two others covering almost the same period, seems less than optimal. My proposal is therefore to change the content scope of this article from the creation of the ATP (1972) to the creation of the ATP Tour (1990). That gives a better coverage of the milestones in tennis history, solves the issue of the 90% duplication between this and the Open Era article and better matches the content with the title of the article. Thoughts?"

The previous discussion above opened this debate further with some editors including myself preferring that we just have the 2 articles Overall & Open Era and that we should delete it, it was also suggested by [[User:Fyunck(click)|Fyunck(click)]] that we should move this discussion into a formal RFC with three available options below which I am doing now.

*''Option 1''. Do we delete this article and re-direct to the Open Era article?
*''Option 2''. Do we keep this article as it is now? 
*''Option 3''. Do we change this article to reflect only records from 1990 when the ATP took full control of the men's tour?

Editors are most welcome to add your comments, thoughts, etc, below.--[[User:Navops47|Navops47]] ([[User talk:Navops47|talk]]) 05:48, 1 February 2016 (UTC)}}

 Is the EGS Accreditation section accurate? Does the information are correct and/or updated?

'''RfC: Is the U.S. accreditation section accurate?'''

I am writing here since it is my understandig that the user "JzG, Guy" is the only administrator who is able to make decision. Even if there is another administrator with a different point of view [Vanjagenjie}, "JzG/Guy"makes the final decision whether or not edit the EGS article
"JzG/Guy" does not like the Maltese accreditation, so it would be not possible to have the EGS article amendend. By doing so, "JzG/Only/Guy" editor has never explained the reason of denying our request. I am asking that other administrators can check what I am writing and I politely request an explanation.
Therefore, below I am posting again the contributions with verifiable and external sources any administrator can check. 

European Accreditation
European Graduate School is a European School headquartered in Switzerland. European Graduate School received the E.U. Accreditation on April 27, 2015 through the Maltese Accreditaion Body "National Commission for Further and Higher Education". The Maltese Accreditation Office recently updated their website with a list of accredited school, and between these appears the European Graduate School <ref></ref>http://ncfhe.gov.mt/en/register/Pages/list_hei.aspx<ref></ref>. Not stating anything about the E.U. Accreditation is misleading because Wikipedia readers think E.U. has no accreditation even if I provided sources of the Accrediation.

U.S. Accreditation
Michigan State info: Why does Wikipedia EGS article host on a misleading external link which does not have anything to do with the Michigan Department of Education? The current information is based on a link of Arab British Accademy for Higher Education and does not come from Michigan Department of Education. In particular, by reading the EGS Wikipedia article: "The State of Michigan Civil Service Commission states that degrees from the EGS "will not be accepted...to satisfy educational requirements indicated on job specifications". This statement is based on the external link website </ref>[http://www.abahe.co.uk/Non-accreditedSchools_78090_7.pdf)</ref>; [1] that does not have anything to do with the Michigan state.
 Indeed, the official Michigan state website is the following:<ref></ref> http://www.michigan.gov/documents/Non-accreditedSchools_78090_7.pdf<ref></ref>. By clicking on that link, does not appear the EGS as a non-accredited school. Therefore, I politely request to remove X (The State of Michigan Civil Service Commission states that degrees from the EGS "will not be accepted...to satisfy educational requirements indicated on job specifications").

Moreover, I request that the current "Accreditation in the United States" would be also removed for the following reasons. European Graduate School is a European University (and not a U.S. School). In other words, applicant students are aware they are applying to a European University, therefore is not correct that the majority of information contained on Wikipedia is based on a U.S. Accreditation. Lastly, I do not find correct the the article contain the following information: "degrees from the EGS are not currently recognized by many state education authorities in the United States". In fact, only two States appear to not recognize them, meanwhile no reference to the remaining 48 States is made. I assume that 48 States recognize EGS degrees so it is not correct that information. Therefore, please change X ["degrees from the EGS are not currently recognized by many state education authorities in the United States"] in Y [48 States recognize EGS degrees and two States (Texas and Maine) don't.]
In addition, in other U.S. states EGS graduates are being hired for U.S. faculty positions (for example, at Georgetown University,[4] New York University,[5] and Princeton University[6][7]). Therefore, why Wikipedia article host only the negative statements and not the positive ones?

Lastly, I provided that the Maine and Texas information are outdated. In fact,  the U.S. Council for Higher Education Accreditation                         <ref></ref> http://www.cheainternational.org/intdb/display1.asp?ID=c95<ref></ref> recognizes the Maltese Accreditation Body (National Commission for Further and Higher Education). The Maltese Accreditation Institute provided Licence no. 2015-007 to European Graduate School on April 27, 2015. As I wrote before, National Commission for Further and Higher Education updated their website confirming that EGS is an accredited school <ref></ref>http://ncfhe.gov.mt/en/register/Pages/list_hei.aspx<ref></ref> . The License is valid from April 2015 to April 2020. 

Can a different administrator (from JzG/Only/Guy) update the EGS with these accurate information?  [[User:Claudioalv|Claudioalv]] ([[User talk:Claudioalv|talk]]) 01:55, 1 March 2016 (UTC)}}

The [[:Category:Wikipedia information pages|information page]] '''[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Motorcycling/Conventions]]''' has been evolving over the last few years, as our version of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Automobiles/Conventions]]. We filched a lot of material from that page, though the motorcycling conventions are not subordinate to the automobile conventions. We often follow their example because wider consensus exists, and some consistency between related projects is desirable. It has been a while since these conventions were discussed, and they have changed in the meantime with little discussion. They have never been officially adopted by the Motorcycling Project, though they have been listed on [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Motorcycling]] with no objections.

The goals of this RfC are to:

#Ensure the conventions to not overstep any Wikipedia-wide [[WP:Policies and guidelines|Policies and guidelines]].
#Remove any parts which lack consensus.
#Correct any egregious errors or contradictions.
#Receive input from non-motorcycling readers and editors, to help make the topic and project accessible to all
#Establish consensus for the conventions.

Beyond that, all changes and commentary are welcome. It might be best to hold off any major deletions until a lot of participants have had a chance to see the starting version of the conventions page, instead using inline notes, highlights, and discussion here on this talk page. --[[User:Dennis Bratland|Dennis Bratland]] ([[User talk:Dennis Bratland|talk]]) 20:13, 1 February 2016 (UTC)}}

I have closed [[Talk:Veganism/Archive 14#RfC: Should the definition at the start of the lead of Veganism contain the wording, 'and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals'?|the RfC]] on whether the first sentence should include, change, or remove "the [[commodity status of animals]]", with a consensus to perform the following: <blockquote>edit the first sentence to mention the main belief ("philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals" or similar) of ethical veganism as a belief that is not always, but ''may'' be followed by vegans.</blockquote> There is no consensus to change "the commodity status of animals" itself. This means that the first sentence should not include the rejection of the commodity status of animals as a belief of veganism generally, but as a belief that ''may'' also be adopted by vegans. The justification for this close is covered in the RfC's closing statement.

The following modifications to the first sentence were proposed in the RfC. This second RfC will decide how the first sentence should be modified. Any proposals for an alternative wording should be started in a separate level-3 section and include "the [[commodity status of animals]]" or similar as there is no consensus to change this.

==RfC: Is administrator "Guy/Only/Jzg" the final say what happen in the article?==This is case where only few administrator have an interest in an article, but with this request for comment process I hope to bring in outside people to review and make a decision. JzG behaviour is malicious because he has never explained why does not recognize Malta Accreditation. Being a smaller country than others is not a good reason. He already blocked me and now he is attempting to block me again so he can reach his goal. By reading on the EGS talk page two different administrator have written that "we probably do have to add the Malta accreditation/licensing"@DGG and "We have some reliable sources that say that this school is properly accredited in Malta by the National Commission for Further and Higher Education of Malta"  @Vanjagenije . One administrator yesterday edited the article but JzG reverted that edit. I am asking: does JzG make the final decision? If yes, why?
JzG's behaviour is also malicious because he tried to hide by changing name to the Michigan misleading link (see Notes and References n. 14 EGS article). It seems that it is a real link (a real world) but is not, because is an outdated pdf that does not have anything to do with the Michigan Education Board [is a pdf written by the Arab British Academy for Higher Education that definitely does not reflect the official Michigan statement]. In fact, the Michigan official website with reference to Non-accredited School is the following  <ref></ref>http://www.michigan.gov/documents/Non-accreditedSchools_78090_7.pdf<ref></ref> and EGS is not in the list. This should be easy to verify. I posted this link 13 times and no one, so far, has given me an explanation why WIkipedia is hosting a false information [i.e.Michigan does not recognize EGS degree] based on an outdated link.[[User:Claudioalv|Claudioalv]] ([[User talk:Claudioalv|talk]]) 04:37, 3 March 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
The article has multiple issues, among them the lack of explaining the actual conspiracy theories in the background section. The background section begins with "9/11 conspiracy theorists reject some or all of the following facts about the 9/11 attacks." References, either do not mention conspiracy theories, or make misleading claims such as, "..fires caused the collapse of the Twin Towers and the destruction and damage of other buildings..."

*Suggestion ('''A'''): Update the current background section in accordance with [http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-14665953 this BBC article] (2011),  for the five most prominent 9/11 conspiracy theories. 
*Suggestion ('''B'''): In particular add the following content based on an edit for two of the BBC's listed conspiracies, ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=9/11_conspiracy_theories&diff=prev&oldid=702995732 read the edit here]).

Either support A and/or B, or oppose the article addition, with a brief explanation why. Use the discussion section to make suggestions and for general input. - [[User:Prokaryotes|prokaryotes]] ([[User talk:Prokaryotes|talk]]) 22:28, 2 February 2016 (UTC)}}

There is dispute over whether to use [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Child_abuse&diff=703160442&oldid=703158955 this] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Child_abuse&diff=703166525&oldid=703164032 this] definition for the [[WP:Lead sentence]] of the [[Child abuse]] article. The latter version is the broader definition. One concern is that since reliable sources say that the definition of child abuse is not always clear, the lead should use the broader wording, especially if it establishes what the words ''abuse'' and ''maltreatment'' mean according to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC). The other concern is that the broader definition is less commonly used, since unintentional harm of a child is often not termed ''child abuse''; because of this, it is therefore misleading to state "any" or "all forms" of harm to a child, especially for things like "neglect" or "exploitation"; the [[Child neglect]] article, for example, makes it very clear that child neglect is commonly difficult to define. 

If receiving this message from the RfC page, see [[Talk:Child abuse#Lead section: WHO definition of child maltreatment]] for more discussion on how to define the lead. Also, [[WP:Med]] and [[WP:Law]] will be alerted to this RfC. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 22:50, 3 February 2016 (UTC)}}

I believe that it is well sourced that the outcome of this war was '''indecisive''' and not a "Maratha Victory" as claimed here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_Anglo-Maratha_War&oldid=701588356]. This claim of an indecisive outcome is proven by a variety of academic sources, including the following <ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=cdXnVOKKkssC&pg=PA226|title=The First Anglo-Maratha War, 1774-1783: A Military Study of Major Battles|page=226|author=M. R. Kantak|others= quote: "Inspite of British superiority in the military science, the British troops could not force a decisive win over the Maratha troops in the First Anglo-Maratha War. The ultimate result of the War  showed that the two sides remained evenly balanced."}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=cYoHOqC7Yx4C&pg=PA290|others=quote: "First Anglo-Maratha War...The war ends inconclusively."|title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture|author=John Bowman|page=290|publisher=Columbia University Press}}</ref>. I think that attempts to try and portray this war as a "Maratha Victory" is indicative of a bias, which violates [[WP:NPOV]]. Even the main painting of a British soldier allegedly submitting to the Marathas is unsourced and does not appear to have a historical basis. I would like additional involvement from other users in regards to this matter. [[User:Xtremedood|Xtremedood]] ([[User talk:Xtremedood|talk]]) 06:30, 7 February 2016 (UTC)}}

'''Survey'''

* '''Support''' in general. This does not mean we should avoid links to full PD movies or other media, whether at Commons, Internet Archive, or hosted elsewhere (as long as it's PD), just that when you are putting these within the prose of the article, they do not help to condense the summary approach we are supposed to be giving the reader. Short clips or screencaps of relevant sections embedded in the prose are infinitely more helpful from an encyclopedic standpoint to showcase something that is of discussion in the neighboring prose rather than the full work and telling the reader to go find it themselves. We don't need to include full classic novels to understand those novels from an encyclopedic viewpoint, so the same logic applies with video and audio. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 15:24, 7 February 2016 (UTC)}}

 Should the following categories be included in this BIO article? [[:Category:Stabbing attacks in 2015]]

'''Oppose inclusion''' I do not believe these categories are appropriate for a biography in any conceivable way. For example [[WP:COPDEF]] states "Categorise by characteristics of the person, not characteristics of the article: The most common mistake of this type is adding an article to Category:Biography. That category may legitimately contain articles about biographical films or biographical books, but should not contain articles about individual people. The article is a biography; the person is not" - Yousef was a terrorist. He was not a terrorist incident. He was not a crime.

The movie ''Debbie Does Dallas'' is in the public domain (according to Commons, although FWIW that's apparently disputed by some parties, but as a general rule we follow what Commons says). So it makes sense to include or link to the film in some way. Two ways have been suggested, and it's been rather contentious with no consensus reached. Asking for more input what say you, fellow editors?
*'''Include it as a click-to-play thumbnail in the body of the article''', below the infobox? or
*'''Include it as a link in the External Links section''', presumably in a Commons icon but with the legend "Full film available at Wikimedia Commons" (with "Full Film" clickable) rather than (or in addition to) the less clear default "Wikimedia Commons has media related to Debbie Does Dallas" (but don't get hung up on the details, please).

Should all of the subcategories of the [[Wikipedia:Good articles/all|Wikipedia:Good articles]] page continue to be placed on the [[Wikipedia:Good article nominations]] page?

The list of good articles (GA) is organized onto ''topics'' (or ''pages''; there are 15 topics/pages), ''subtopics'' (there are 37 subtopics across the topics). From the beginning, all of the topics and subtopics on the good articles page have also all been placed onto the good article nominations (GAN) page.<ref>There are also ''sub-subtopics'' (there are 444 sub-subtopics across the subtopics). ''Sub-subtopics'' from the GA page have never been placed onto the GAN page, except in helpful explanation sentences found under each subtopic. This RfC is not concerned about sub-subtopics.</ref><ref>Naturally, in an ever-expanding encyclopedia, editors improve the categorization on the GA page: never adding topics but occasionally adding subtopics. The last time this was done was to add an additional subtopic ("Classical compositions") to the Music topic and to add seven additional subtopics ("Armies and military units", "Battles, exercises, and conflicts", "Military aircraft", "Military decorations and memorials", "Military people", "Warships and naval units", "Weapons, equipment, and buildings") to the Warfare topic. (The time before that, three years ago in November 2012, the topic name "Theatre, film and drama" was changed to "Media and drama" and the subtopics "Film" and "Television" were created; see [[Wikipedia talk:Good article nominations/Archive 18#Changing Section Headings]].)</ref> 

I propose we add the additional subtopic ("Classical compositions") to the Music topic and to add seven additional subtopics ("Armies and military units", "Battles, exercises, and conflicts", "Military aircraft", "Military decorations and memorials", "Military people", "Warships and naval units", "Weapons, equipment, and buildings") to the Warfare topic. To do so involves editing the GAN page to add the new subtopics and enhancing Legobot to use the new subtopics.<ref>This has not been done; note that the GAN page must be edited first before the enhancements may be added, as the bot inserts articles between specially placed comments on the GAN page.</ref>

Of course, the developer/operator of Legobot, {{u|Legoktm}}, who took over this responsibility in 2012, is invited to this discussion and their input is critical. It appears we haven't yet had a subtopic change under Legoktm's watch.

There are a few other things to consider. First: The GAN page looks odd with empty subtopics and empty subtopics could confuse people, although of course it's only temporary, so we should probably not add them until Legobot is nearly ready to use them. Second: Remember that a subtopic on the GAN page is also a queue in which we wait for our GAN to be reviewed; more subtopics may mean it is not as far from the bottom of the queue to the top. And last: Maybe some other GA/GAN subtopics should also be divided into additional subtopics; for example the "Sports and recreation" subtopic is quite large on the GAN page.<ref>Although new subtopic names are not immediately obvious here.</ref>

Thank-you for your comments. My thanks to {{u|BlueMoonset}} who helped research this. Best, [[User:Prhartcom|Prhartcom]] ([[User talk:Prhartcom|talk]]) 17:08, 8 March 2016 (UTC)}}

Following [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)/Archive_119#Jr._comma_RfC:_Survey an RfC in April 2015], the text of [[MOS:JR]] was amended to allow both the use and omission of commas around the suffix "Jr" in names. In other words, as long as an article is internally consistent, one is allowed to write either {{xt|Martin Luther King, Jr,}} or {{xt|Martin Luther King Jr}}. In recent discussions of the matter, it has come to light that the form with the commas, whilst traditional, has lost ground to the form without them. If one reads [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Comma#In_English:_Commas_used_with_.22Jr.5B..5D.22_and_.22Sr.5B..5D.22 a survey of style guides] done by [[User:SMcCandlish|SMcCandlish]], it becomes apparent that eliminating the comma not only has advantages in terms of readability, but it also is nearly universally recommended across the various varieties of English. Eliminating the comma improves prose readability, fulfilling [[MOS:COMMA]]'s recommendation to reduce comma usage, where it is possible. In addition, it eliminates the necessity of the matching comma, which is often omitted in error or otherwise misused.

Based on these findings, should [[MOS:JR]] be amended to prefer the use of the suffix "Jr" without commas? [[User:RGloucester|<span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:12pt;color:#000000">RGloucester </span>]] — [[User talk:RGloucester|☎]] 23:34, 25 February 2016 (UTC)}}

Articles often mention both medial reports from 29 July 2014 about Muhahxeri allegedy appearing on beheading footage from Syria [17] and a warrant from Court of Ferizaj and Interpol from the 6 September 2014 in the same articles but they don’t claim that the warrant is issued for the alleged beheading footage [17]; ‘The demand comes from the Basic Court of Ferizaj, which has issued a warrant for Muhaxheri after he is accused of terrorism and organized groups to go to Syria and Iraq’ [17]'. Published court records on 15 January 2016 only mention text messages as evidence for recruitment.[65] The question is about formulation of medial claims in regard to NPOV; avoid stating opinions as facts; shouldn't ‘On 29 July 2014 Muhaxheri uploaded photos to a Facebook page where he is seen beheading an unidentified young man in Syria.’(1/2) (2/3) be stated as 'According to Balkan media, on 29 July 2014 an individual posted two (2) images to a Facebook page under the pseudonym "Lavdrim Muhaxheri" ( it's questioned which published  footage is of Muhaxheri [11]) that, to some extent, give the impression of a man having beheaded an unidentified young man.' or something to the effect of a neutral statement where it's mentioned who's claiming it?

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
This article was created in 2011 as an expansion of a section in the [[Government of Australia]] article. It has been much discussed and modified in that time, but has remained essentially stable for several years. Summarising the lede:
* the term head of state does not appear in the Australian constitution (or any other law)
* there is a disagreement among Australians centred on the question of whether the monarch or the governor-general is the country's head of state
* the disagreement has involved viceroys, politicians, legal scholars, and the media
* the question was most prominently debated in the context of an Australian republic at the Australian Constitutional Convention 1998
* it has recurrently been discussed in publications before and since.

Two new editors have raised questions about the validity of the article, and several options have emerged. How should we proceed?
# The article is rubbish. The Queen is the Australian head of state and any statements to the contrary are errors or misunderstandings. The article should be removed entirely.
# The article is mostly rubbish. A few prominent Australians and sections of the media claim the Governor-General is the head of state, but this is a fringe theory. The article should be merged into other articles.
# The article is well sourced and describes the situation accurately. It is notable because few (if any) other nations dispute the identity of their head of state. It should be retained and improved.

There is an ongoing dispute regarding the [[Campus_sexual_assault#Criticism|criticisms]] subsection. Specifically, editors have objected to the bulleted list section that details several lawsuits filed by men who were expelled from universities after being accused of sexual assault. The most recent discussion is [[Talk:Campus_sexual_assault#Undue_weight_for_criticism_section|here]]. Generally, the suggested changes are to either:

*1. Leave the bulleted list unchanged, and add a roughly equal amount of detail on cases filed against universities by accusers. 

or 

*2. Offer a couple of short summary statements that address the recent increase in lawsuits filed by students accused of sexual assault without focusing on specific cases. 

Please place comments or preferences below, and feel free to suggest alternate wordings of these options or add more as needed. [[User:Nblund|Nblund]] ([[User talk:Nblund|talk]]) 20:40, 21 February 2016 (UTC)}}

The issues in dispute are whether [[History of IBM CKD Controllers #2841]] should be split back into a separate IBM 2841 article and whether the list of supported devices should include the IBM 7320 in addition to or in place of the IBM 2303, rather than relegating it to a footnote.

When a song or album is the only song or album to have a standalone article on Wikipedia, but other songs or albums of the same name are listed on the disambiguation page for that name per [[MOS:DABMENTION]], should the article title of the notable song or album include the artist name?

Some songs and albums are the only song or album with its name to meet notability guidelines and have an article on Wikipedia, but other songs or albums of the same name are listed on the disambiguation page per [[MOS:DABMENTION]]. The current situation on the inclusion of artist names in article titles is inconsistent. A few examples of no artist names in article titles include [[Umbrella (song)]], [[Pillowtalk (song)]], and [[Anti (album)]]; they are the only songs and albums of their names to be notable enough for a standalone article on Wikipedia, although there are other non-notable songs/albums of the same name listed at [[Umbrella (disambiguation)#Songs]], [[Pillow talk (disambiguation)#Songs]], and [[Anti#Music]] respectively. A few examples of artist names in article titles include [[Chandelier (Sia song)]], [[Blackstar (David Bowie song)]], and [[Title (Meghan Trainor album)]]; similarly, they are the only songs and albums of their names to be notable enough for a standalone article on Wikipedia, but [[Chandelier (song)]], [[Blackstar (song)]] and [[Title (album)]] redirect to disambiguation pages, where other non-notable songs/albums of the same name are listed. [[WP:PRECISION]] states {{tq|According to the above-mentioned precision criterion, when a more detailed title is necessary to distinguish an article topic from another, use only as much additional detail as necessary.}} [[WP:NCM]] states {{tq|Use further disambiguation only when needed (for example X (American band), X (Australian band)).}} The dispute arises on whether non-notable songs and albums that lack standalone articles can be considered "article topics". I think we can all agree that the current inconsistency is not ideal, and I am starting a request for comment for a result that should apply to most usual cases.

Does the [[WP:TITLECHANGES]] section on changing the national variety of English in an article title need to be clarified?

Article titles which have to choose between two national varieties of English (Yogurt vs. Yoghurt, Color vs. Colour, Humor vs. Humour, and so on) are often subject to perennial move discussions which are often lengthy, contentious, and brutal wastes of time as they rarely resolve anything. Our manual of style currently says, "{{green|If an article title has been stable for a long time, and there is no good reason to change it, it should not be changed. [...] If it has never been stable, or it has been unstable for a long time, and no consensus can be reached on what the title should be, default to the title used by the first major contributor after the article ceased to be a stub.}}" I think the point that needs to be clarified is what makes a title "stable": editors disagree whether stable means "not moved" versus "no move discussions". Or perhaps "default to the title used by the first major contributor..." is being interpreted as a "good reason to change it", absent any other reasons.

The problem this creates is being exemplified in yet another move discussion at [[Talk:Humour]] where it's been suggested that the title is unstable because of the repeated move discussions over a long period (the page has actually been at this title since 13 May 2007), and as a result it's being argued that the "default to the title used by the first major contributor after the article ceased to be a stub" applies, and then there is debate about which version is the first non-stub version. I would like to see that confusion resolved one way or the other, but I'm not sure how to do it, and I don't know what the original intent was.

I suggest these changes (marked up as best I could):
*to [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Retaining the existing variety]]: {{green|When no English variety has been established and discussion cannot resolve the issue, the variety used in the first <s>non-stub</s> revision is considered the default. If no English variety was used consistently, the tie is broken by the first <s>post-stub</s> contributor to introduce text written in a particular English variety.}}
*to [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Considering title changes]]: {{green|If an article title has <s>been stable</s><u>not been changed</u> for a long time, and there is no <s>good</s><u>other</u> reason to change it, it should not be changed. [...] If <s>it has never been stable, or it has been unstable for a long time, and<s> no consensus can be reached on what the title should be, <s>default to the title used by the first major contributor after the article ceased to be a stub</s>the tie is broken by the first contributor to introduce test written in a particular English variety.}}

I think these changes will help to resolve conflicts about which variety to use, so that we don't go back and forth endlessly and have editors repeatedly bringing up the same move proposals over and over again.

A previous RfC had 3 supporting editors for changing the current arbitrary century marker dates to important benchmark dates in the Bach Legacy time-line, with 2 editors opposed which resulted in deadlock. The current chronology of the Bach Legacy section is arbitrarily organized by century markers like 1800, 1900, 2000, etc, rather than specific important dates directly relevant to the Bach Legacy section. Another RfC (see above on Talk page) has identified 1829 (the date of the Mendelssohn Bach revival) as being of heightened importance to understanding the Bach Legacy as a whole. Mendelssohn worked extensively to revive Bach's reputation between 1824-1829 with the revived performance of Bach's Matthew Passion in Germany in 1829. The dates in the Bach chronology should reflect this in a new and enhanced outline covering first, '''1750-1829''', followed by '''1830-1899''', etc, leaving the rest of the section unchanged at this time. This RfC is to determine SUPPORT or OPPOSE for the enhanced specification of the benchmark dates over and against the use of arbitrary century markers currently used in the Bach Legacy section.

There was an incident with a trainer while Manning was at college that was settled but came back to the public light due to the mention of [[Peyton Manning]] in other negative history that I'm going to explain later. My idea is to add this lines to the UT Volunteers section in Manning's BLP:

{{quote|On 2016, the incident was back at the public light after the [[New York Daily News]] published an article recounting Naughright’s original complaint and 74 pages of Polk County Circuit Court documents related to that case.<ref name=king_02132016>{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Shaun|title=KING: Peyton Manning’s squeaky-clean image was built on lies, as detailed in explosive court documents showing ugly smear campaign against his alleged sex assault victim|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/king-peyton-manning-squeaky-clean-image-built-lies-article-1.2530395|accessdate=February 13, 2016|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=February 13, 2016}}</ref> Afterwards, a lawsuit against the University of Tennessee was filed alleging [[Title IX]] violations by the school with papers citing the incident with Naughright.<ref>http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2016/02/14/complete-coverage-university-tennessee-sex-assault-lawsuit/80380324</ref> Subsequently, the University filed a motion to strike any reference of Manning from the lawsuit.<ref>www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2016/02/23/tennessee-wants-manning-reference-removed-from-lawsuit/80828682</ref>}}

Then, there's a mention of Manning in an [[Al Jazeera English]] documentary explaining the possibility of Manning using PED substances, and as he spoke with ESPN about that, I had the idea of adding a couple of lines surrounding that interview about the documentary and Manning's mention on his 2015 BLP section:

{{quote|On December 27, 2015, a day before Broncos' game versus the [[Cincinati Bengals]], [[Al Jazeera America]] released documentary called ''"[[Al Jazeera English#The Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers|The Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers]]"'' which investigated professional athletes' potential use of [[Performance-enhancing drugs]] (PEDs) naming [[Peyton Manning]] and other prominent athletes as having received drugs from Charles Sly, a pharmacist who had worked at the Guyer Anti-Aging Clinic in Indianapolis during the fall of 2011.<ref name="aljazeera1">{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/12/dark-side-secrets-sports-dopers-151227133355144.html |title=The dark side: The secret world of sports doping |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2015-12-29}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14441114/documentary-links-peyton-manning-other-pro-athletes-use-peds |title=Documentary links Peyton Manning, other pro athletes to use of PEDs |website=Espn.go.com |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2015-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/12/29/al-jazeera-reporter-stresses-that-no-allegation-is-being-made-against-peyton-manning/ |title=Al Jazeera reporter stresses that no allegation is being made against Peyton Manning &#124; ProFootballTalk |website=Profootballtalk.nbcsports.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-08}}</ref> Manning told [[ESPN]]'s [[Lisa Salters]] about the reports on an interview, calling them "completely fabricated" and "garbage", and he also expressed his anger about his wife, Ashley, mentioned in the documentary.<ref name="denvbron">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Transcript-Peyton-Manning-interviews-with-ESPNs-Lisa-Salters/f07ef954-bada-42fc-ab64-f9f38dc9fb49 |title=Transcript: Peyton Manning interviews with ESPN's Lisa Salters |website=Denverbroncos.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-29}}</ref> As [[Al Jazeera America#Reactions to "The Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers" documentary|several reactions about the topic were stated]], Manning took response and hired former [[Presidency of George W.

These are short lines, are conclusive and express important facts without compromise the [[WP:NPOV]] of the article, as the mentioned facts not only involved Manning, but also other institutions and third persons. I'm trying to do my best. [[User:Leo Bonilla|Leo Bonilla]] ([[User talk:Leo Bonilla|talk]]) 22:00, 27 March 2016 (UTC)}}

It has come to my attention that certain articles, such as the article for [[Roger Craig Smith]], have been edited to include information on an animated series called "Galaxy World of Alisa". It's apparently based on a Russian children's book character, but a few Google searches don't yield too much. I don't exactly know what to do for this, and I would appreciate it if someone were to help me look into this further so I can figure out whether or not to delete the information from these articles.

I propose to change "pro-choice" to "pro-abortion" due to the bias of the term "pro-choice".

[[WP:RS#Vendor and e-commerce sources]] says: ''Although the content guidelines for External links prohibits linking to "Individual web pages that primarily exist to sell products or services," inline citations may be allowed to e-commerce pages such as that of a book on a bookseller's page or an album on its streaming-music page, in order to verify such things as titles and running times. Journalistic and academic sources are preferable, however, and e-commerce links should be replaced with non-commercial reliable sources if available.''

{{User|Bgwhite}}, an editor whose work I have seen and respect, has been removing supporting references to Amazon that provide reference support for information such as book titles and publication dates. Examples from my watchlist are:
* {{la|Magic Tree House (series)}}; and
* {{la|Laura Schwendinger}}.  

The references were already present in the Magic Tree House article; I didn't add them. I did add the reference to the Schwendinger article; the material it supports was already there, but unreferenced, and on a quick Google search, I could find no better reference.

I've pointed out this guideline, and that sources should be replaced; but can still be used until replaced.

BGwhite's approach is to simply delete the references, with comments such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magic_Tree_House_%28series%29&type=revision&diff=707771965&oldid=707771819 "Amazon IS NOT a valid source. Period."] I disagree; I think it is acceptable edit behavior to either ''replace'' the Amazon cite with a better cite, or add {{tl|better source}} to flag it for another editor, but not to delete the cite and leave it unreferenced.

On his [[User talk:Bgwhite#Amazon as a RS|talk page]], BGwhite says "It says when a better source is available, use it instead of the commercial site." I'm good with that, but these edits are not substituting a better source; they are not using a better source.  They are simply removing the existing source.

I realize for the Magic Tree House article, I could probably google-search and come up with something (and indeed, for the book series, one thing I'd like to do when I have the time is to add an ISBN-based footnote for each book); but I'm thinking of the bigger picture here, and the pattern of deleting sources and leaving material unsourced as a result.

All this basically calls into question this guideline. Should Amazon cites be deleted without replacing with a better site? Should this guideline be updated? [[User:TJRC|TJRC]] ([[User talk:TJRC|talk]]) 19:02, 1 March 2016 (UTC)}}

What guidance should [[WP:Disambiguation]] give for article titles that do not result in a conflict between two or more articles, but which are not inherently unambiguous to a general audience?

'''Background:
*[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Disambiguation&diff=665798731&oldid=663463105 This content] regarding titles that inherently lack precision was added to [[WP:DAB]] on June 6, 2015, by {{u|SMcCandlish}}, consisting of a paragraph under "Is there a Primary Topic?", an example under "Deciding to disambiguate", and a summary sentence in the lead paragraph: "Disambiguation may also be applied to a title that inherently lacks precision and would be likely to confuse readers if it is not clarified, even it does not presently result in a titling conflict between two or more articles." SMcCandlish posted a rationale of this addition to [[Wikipedia_talk:Disambiguation/Archive_43#Disambiguating_WP:PRECISION_failures|the talk page]], which received no replies.
*On July 16, 2015, {{u|Red Slash}} [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Disambiguation&diff=671784557&oldid=671612130 removed] the main paragraph, with the comment "How does this have anything at all to do with disambiguation?".  A [[Wikipedia_talk:Disambiguation/Archive_43#WP:PRECISIONDAB|talk page discussion]] between Red Slash and {{u|Francis Schonken}} discussed this removal.
*On July 28, 2015, Red Slash [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Disambiguation&diff=673503177&oldid=673300432 removed] the example under "Deciding to disambiguate". On August 6, this example was restored by SMcCandlish and again removed by Red Slash, then, on August 7,  restored by SMCandlish, removed by Francis Schonken, again restored by SMcCandlish, and again removed by Francis Schonken. An [[Wikipedia_talk:Disambiguation/Archive_44#Natural_and_clarifying_disambiguation|RFC]] on the content from that time doesn't appear to have been officially closed, but by my count has three editors in support of the principle of "disambiguation for clarification" and three opposed.
*In February 2016, the lead sentence (the only remaining portion of the content originally added June 6) was removed by {{u|Born2cycle}}, restored by by SMcCandlish, removed by {{u|BD2412}}, restored by {{u|Dicklyon}}, removed by {{u|Calidum}}, restored by {{u|Tony1}}, removed by Calidum, restored by Tony1, removed by Calidum, and restored by {{u|Bagumba}} who locked the page for edit warring. A [[Wikipedia_talk:Disambiguation/Archive_45#Unsupported_change_reverted|talk page]] discussion did not result in any clear consensus.
*On March 23, the lead sentence was removed by {{u|Dohn joe}}, restored by {{u|In ictu oculi}}, removed by Dohn joe, and restored by SMcCandlish. A further [[Wikipedia_talk:Disambiguation#Restored_content_on_precision_cut_from_lead|talk page discussion]] ensued. 
*With respect to the participants on both sides, the discussion of the proposed guideline so far has generated more heat than light. I'm hoping a straightforward and (pardon the pun) unambiguous RFC can resolve the issue somewhat permanently and put an end to the disruptions to [[WP:D]]. Two of the talk page discussions have proposed taking this to RFC, but don't seem to have been able to reach agreement even on what an RFC should look like. As I have not, to my recollection, participated in the dispute, I have done my best to frame it neutrally and been so bold as to just go ahead and post it here. Please let me know if I have missed anything salient in the above summary.--[[User:Trystan|Trystan]] ([[User talk:Trystan|talk]]) 02:34, 25 March 2016 (UTC)}}

As this is essentially a ''de facto'' guideline at this point, I think it's high time that this essay be promoted to an ''actual'' guideline.

{{rfcquote|text=
This statement in the EGS article is not correct: "The State of Michigan Civil Service Commission states that degrees from the EGS "will not be accepted...to satisfy educational requirements indicated on job specifications". In fact, this information relies on a false (false because is not official) and outdated (it dates back to 2009) external link. In particular, the following and current link http://www.abahe.co.uk/Non-accreditedSchools_78090_7.pdf comes from the Arab British Accademy for Higher Education and does not reflect the Michigan Civil Service Commission official statement. In other words, the current information is based on the external link that does not have anything to do with the Michigan State. On the contrary, the official and updated (2016) Michigan state website is the following: http://www.michigan.gov/documents/Non-accreditedSchools_78090_7.pdf . By clicking on that link, does not appear the EGS as a non-accredited school. Moreover, I note that it sets forth: "Degrees issued by foreign colleges and universities may be accepted if an applicant or employee presents evidence to demonstrate that the degree represents education equivalent to similar studies at an accredited university". 
So, my question for this RfC is: Should we take off the information about the Michigan Civil Service Commission to the EGS article, Accreditation Section?. [[User:Claudioalv|Claudioalv]] ([[User talk:Claudioalv|talk]]) 03:30, 13 March 2016 (UTC)}}

We have some reliable sources that say that this school is properly accredited in [[Malta]] by the National Commission for Further and Higher Education of Malta (NCFHE). Here they are:
*{{cite web | url=http://ncfhe.gov.mt/en/register/Pages/list_hei.aspx | title=Higher Education Institutions | publisher=National Commission for Further and Higher Education | date=April 2015 | accessdate=1 March 2016}}

Now, I tried to use those sources and add this information to the article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=European_Graduate_School&diff=707814728&oldid=707788703 diff]), but was reverted by another user ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=European_Graduate_School&diff=next&oldid=707814728 diff]) under the pretext that Malta is small country and that being accredited in Malta does not mean that the institution is properly accredited. But, I never said that it is properly accredited or anything similar. I just added the info found in reliable sources. 

So, my question for this RfC is: Should we add the information about the Malta accreditation to the article? '''[[User:Vanjagenije|<font color="008B8B">Vanjagenije</font>]] [[User talk:Vanjagenije|<font color="F4A460">(talk)</font>]]''' 19:13, 2 March 2016 (UTC)}}

There have been several suggestions made towards rewriting the lead (among other parts of the article) to more accurately portray the individual and to reflect a more NPOV as per WP:BLP. Among others, at issue is "An article in Time described the medical and scientific communities' opinion of him as ranging from dismissive to damning; criticism includes statements that his approach could lure sick people away from effective treatments." One argument is this does not accurately reflect the source and that any positive portions of the article have been rejected. The other is that the positive proposed edits are not supported, that the Time source is essential and the article is fine as it is.  Do the sources support the changes? Is the lead balanced/representative of a NPOV? Relevant sections : [[Talk:Deepak_Chopra#Lead_Section]] and [[Talk:Deepak_Chopra#Lead_issues.2Frevisions]].

The Main Page sometimes has factual errors (mainly on [[WP:DYK]], also in other sections). At the moment, these get quietly corrected or removed, but no acknowledgment of this is being made. Similarly to what happens with e.g. newspapers ([[Correction (newspaper)]]), we could make a note of factual errors we featured on the Main Page in either the same spot (so a DYK error gets noted in the DYK section of the main page) or in a separate section on the Main Page. This should only be done for facts, not for grammatical errors, capitalization changes and the like. This was recently done a few times, but met with mixed reactions. How exactly this should be done is not really important, first we need to agree on whether this is wanted or not. [[User:Fram|Fram]] ([[User talk:Fram|talk]]) 10:42, 23 March 2016 (UTC)}}

I have recently removed, for the third time, the section on recently deceased people which has included those who were on the living list who died within the last year. As far as I can see the inclusion of this section violates [[WP:NOTMEMORIAL]] and in any cast the list is specifically for living people and recently deceased is not living. The only comment on the re-adding of this material is that "This is very useful and has nothing to do with a memorial. It makes it easy to keep up with who died recently. Quite essential for a site of living people." I don't see that this is sufficient justification for inclusion.

Should we list the [[WP:INUNIVERSE|in-universe]] (fictional) former names, aliases, middle names only ever mentioned rarely or in non-canon material, and other name variants of fictional characters, in the leads of these characters' articles?  Example:

* '''Jeanne Mary (Garcia) Deaux''' is a character on the soap opera ''Last Days of Our Lives'' ...
* '''Jeanne Mary Deaux''' (formerly '''Jeanne Smith''', born '''Juanita Maria Garcia''') is a character on the soap opera ''Last Days of Our Lives'' ...
* '''The Superfudge''' (in day-to-day life the reclusive businessman '''Robert O'Blivion''', a carefully maintained alias of '''Petrov Vlaidimir Zorkov III''') is a superhero in ...

A recent discussion of this matter, with editwarring and [[WP:ANI]] drama surrounding it, can be found at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Soap Operas#Middle names, maiden names, married names, birth names, etc...]]. This relates closely to previous discussions like [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics/Archive 48#Lead section and character names]], about changing comics character leads (for articles at the name of the superhero/supervillain) to begin with the fictional "real" name of the character in everyday "life", as if these were articles on real people.

An excessive genuine example of the issue is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nikki_Newman&oldid=664256108 here] ("Nicole "Nikki" Newman (née Reed; previously Foster, Bancroft, DiSalvo, Abbott, Landers, Chow, and Sharpe) is a fictional character ..."), but is not representative of typical cases, and the RfC question is more general; i.e. it should be taken as using the first of the above examples as typical. It should also be noted that the simple formula "Superman is a fictional superhero.... As Clark Kent, he is a journalist by day...", or "Iron Man (Tony Stark) is a fictional superhero...", is typical in superhero/villain articles, and many other fiction (novel, TV series, etc.) articles on fictional characters with aliases, and this RfC is not challenging that. There are more complex cases as at [[Spider-Man]], where the "real" (fictional) person who is the superhero has changed over time; these generally approach this matter with prose explanations, not long strings of alternative names, and is often handled outside the lead, as at [[The Shadow]]. <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 21:02, 26 March 2016 (UTC)}}

'''Proposal: Should we remove from {{tlx|Infobox person}} the {{para|religion}} parameter (and the associated {{para|denomination}} one)?'''<br />
* Religion would be covered in the main article body, with context and sources (if included as relevant at all, per consensus at the article).
* Permit inclusion in individual articles' infoboxes (through the template's ability to accept custom parameters) if directly tied to the person's notability, per consensus at the article.
* Permit inclusion in derived, more specific infoboxes that genuinely need it for all cases, such as one for religious leaders.

'''Rationale''': This would be consistent with our treatment of sexual orientation and various other things we don't include in infoboxes that are matters which may be nuanced, complex, and frequently controversial.  The availability of a parameter encourages editors to fill it, whether they have consensus to do so or not, regardless of instructions in template documentation to gain consensus first; new and anon IP editors generally do not read documentation, they simply see a "missing" parameter at article B that they saw at article A and add it.

While written for [[WP:Category|categories]], the concerns of [[WP:CAT/R]] and [[WP:NONDEF]] may be [[WP:Common sense|logically applicable]] here, since the context-free data in infoboxes serves a categorization/labeling purpose, not an expository one; their reasoning is frequently applied to [[WP:NAVBOX|navbox]] templates, at least informally. So is that of the [[WP:BLPCAT]] policy, which explicitly covers them, and lists.  Per [[WP:NOTBUREAUCRACY]], [[WP:LAWYER]], and [[WP:GAMING]], if the community's consensus is to avoid certain kinds of arbitrary, contentious, or factually questionable labelling, this consensus must not be evaded by moving the label to a different spot on the page in a different wrapper.

{{block indent|1=<small>'''Procedural notes''': I'm listing this at VP because RfCs at the infobox template talk pages tend to overrepresent the views of infobox template editors and those who argue about these templates frequently, and I think this deserves – requires – broader input, considering reader needs, encyclopedic purpose, editorial community strife levels, etc.  I think matters like this also very directly relate to the resistance against including infoboxes in entire categories of biographical articles, but I'm not going to leave pointers to this RfC at every wikiproject on the system; VPPOL exists for a reason.  PS: If anyone really wants to, the places to look for any previous RfCs or other discussions on this parameter would be the archives of this page, of [[Template talk:Infobox person]], [[Template talk:Infobox]], [[Wikipedia talk:Biographies of living persons]], [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Biography]], [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Infoboxes]], and [[Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)]] (all of which have already been notified of the current discussion, and [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#RfC: Ethnicity in Infoboxes|the similar one]] on the {{para|ethnicity}} parameter.</small>}}

;Question:
Should section header regarding Dr. Luke's legal battles with [[Kesha]] mention sexual assault allegations by Kesha against Dr. Luke? If so, what should the section be titled?

;Summary of dispute prompting RfC:
Previous section header was and is now currently "[[Dr. Luke#Lawsuit with Kesha|§Lawsuit with Kesha]]", which was established in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Luke&action=historysubmit&type=revision&diff=647413350&oldid=646925142 an edit] by {{U|SNUGGUMS}} over a year ago per discussion on the talk page (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ADr._Luke&type=revision&diff=647413562&oldid=647373287]). {{U|TripleVenom}} strongly feels (and acts in good faith) that the section header should reflect the sexual assault allegations made against Dr. Luke by Kesha. They have changed the section header to "Sexual Assault Allegations" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Luke&diff=703315774&oldid=703299343], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Luke&type=revision&diff=703320987&oldid=703316592]) and "Sexual assault allegations and lawsuit" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Luke&diff=709407479&oldid=709306067], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dr._Luke&diff=709416699&oldid=709407889]). Others, myself included, have objected to the change. This dispute started during early February 2016 when media attention and social media campaigns around a judge's ruling prompted some editors to target this page.  This has been the subject of dispute on the talk page; see [[#Sexual Assault Allegations]], [[#Semi-protected edit request on 20 February 2016]]. Discussion, however, has been rather sparse and between a handful of editors so I am initiating this RfC for further input and to hopefully gain consensus on the issue. <small>I am INVOLVED but have tried to summarize the dispute as neutrally as possible.

Should [[George Washington#Legacy]] be merged into this article, with only a short [[WP:SUMMARY|summary]] left behind? Rationale: This legacy article exists for a reason, and the main GW article is swimming in "legacy" trivia, with disputes on the talk page there about adding more of it, distracting from the purpose of improving the historical bio article.

After the merger, a section that is a comprehensive treatment of GW in fiction should be written (in prose, not as a list), for things like filmic portrayals, use of GW as a major video game character (often as in an anhistorical way), etc., or people will never strop trying to insert bullet items about video games, comics, etc., into the main article, which is about the actual historical figure. <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 22:27, 14 March 2016 (UTC)}}

There have been numerous reports about the aftermath of the doping violations in this event from multiple runners. Some of the trials have concluded, while some are in progress. The key distinction for medals and finishers, though, comes from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Alptekin's positive test was in May 2013 and her ban announced in August 2015; however, the IOC has made no specific announcement and the distribution of medals hasn't changed. 

So what's the WP policy (and ideally with some precedent) on listing Alptekin, Kareiva, and Kostetskaya as DSQ in the finals? At the minimum, there's a problem with conflicting sources. [[User:Irregulargalaxies|Irregulargalaxies]] ([[User talk:Irregulargalaxies|talk]]) 19:25, 8 March 2016 (UTC)}}

Blocking is very important in cases where the user indulge in persistent personal attacks, vandalism, copyright issues, etc. However, as identified by the community numerous times, newcomers are often not totally aware of the policies and guidelines that are ought to be followed on Wikipedia. Even after repeated warnings, some new users try to contribute to Wikipedia in good faith and end up being blocked to prevent further disruption. They are even blocked from editing pages in their namespace.
I'd like to raise an idea here. What if perpetual disruptive editors were allowed to edit their user namespace, or, at least their Sandbox and possibly create draft articles, while gradually getting acquainted with the rules here. Editing their ''own'' namespace has little possibility to disrupt Wikipedia.

Many editors and readers, including a number on this talk page, have expressed concern that there is much unnecessary spoiling allowed on Wikipedia, and that this guideline is used as justification for spoiling any and everywhere; this is also despite the fact that the guideline currently states, '''"When including spoilers, editors should make sure that an ''encyclopedic purpose'' is being served."''' Like [[User:McGeddon|McGeddon]] noted, "it's probably worth clarifying the spoiler guideline to say which kinds of sections include spoilers and which shouldn't, to reflect how articles are generally being written. The article for [[The Sixth Sense]] does not give away its twist ending in the lede, or even directly state that there is one, but has no qualms about mentioning the ending in the Production section, since it's useful to the interested reader to share information about how the filmmakers approached it. The [[Breaking Bad]] [...] character descriptions [in the] [[Breaking_Bad#Cast_and_characters|overview cast list]] treads lightly and doesn't go much further than saying which seasons characters appeared in, while the full [[List of Breaking Bad characters]] article goes into great detail about each character's story arc, as this is the kind of thing somebody researching the show would want to know. Clearly there's some informal consensus that when writing articles that it's inappropriate to spoil plot elements in places where they aren't entirely necessary and might surprise the reader ('' 'make sure that an encyclopedic purpose is being served' '' is perhaps trying to say that), and I think this guideline could do with pinning that down." 

I concur with McGeddon, and propose that the "When including spoilers, editors should make sure that an ''encyclopedic purpose'' is being served." wording be changed to the following wording from [[WP:How to write a plot summary#Spoilers]]: {{tq|When summarizing a plot and choosing what details to include, editors should use discretion.  The advantages of exhaustive coverage of the work are in dynamic tension with the desire to preserve the artistic qualities of the work for readers.<ref>This standard parallels the dynamic tension between the policy that [[WP:NOTCENSORED|Wikipedia is not censored]], and the practice of not tolerating sensationalism or offensiveness for its own sake.</ref>  Wikipedia should contain potentially 'spoiling' detail where it substantially enhances the reader's understanding of the work and its impact but be omitted when it merely ruins the experience of the work of fiction for our readers.}} Or that we just use the second sentence. Or that we change the wording to something else that is clearer than the current guideline's wording, to indicate that it is not okay to spoil for spoiling's sake. A Proposals section is below for those who want to suggest alternative wording. And a Discussion section is below for whatever else. I will alert [[WP:TV]], [[WP:Film]], [[WP:Manual of Style]] and [[WP:Village pump (policy)]] to this discussion.

On the 38th anniversary day of Islamic revolution of Iran, Iranian people reacted to the capture of 10 US sailors by simulating the scene, in some cities such as [[Tehran]] and [[Qom]]. They did it in a variety of styles using teenagers and older men. The incident was covered by multiple sources such as [http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35553150 BBC], [http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/iran-mocks-u-s-sailors-at-parade-marking-1979-revolution-1.2775164 CTV News], [http://www.irdiplomacy.ir/en/page/1956462/Don%E2%80%99t+Make+Us+Look+Ridiculous.html Irdiplomacy], [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3442762/Now-Iran-mocks-captured-sailors-street-parade-featuring-schoolboys-Tehran-depicting-surrender-crowds-hold-Death-America-banners.html Daily mail], [http://observer.com/2016/02/holiday-jeer-irans-victory-parade-intends-to-humiliate-america/ Observer] and etc. The related information along with [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Simulation_of_Arresting_American_Soldiers_on_February_2016_by_Mbazri_01.jpg?uselang=fa a photo] was inserted in the reaction section which was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2016_U.S.%E2%80%93Iran_naval_incident&diff=708713754&oldid=708634300 removed] later claiming that they were not encyclopedic.

The capitalization of “Real Robot” is non-standard; genre names (mystery, romance, science fiction) are not capitalized in English as a rule, and this name exists in lowercase usage.

::: There isn't consensus concerning the following requested additions. We had one editor, [[User:Newtonlee|Newtonlee]]  accept the above changes; another, [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]], reject some while making others without waiting for consensus and not addressing several others except to say he'd change anything back that he didn't agree with. Here's a summary of the disagreement: 

::: 1. Whether Beepi's latest valuation should be included. [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]] included a new statement in the article that Beepi did not disclose their valuation, but then discredited a highly credible source, [[Forbes]], which actually reported the valuation. He is framing the company to look badly, as though what they did not reveal to a single magazine, on one occasion, is the relevant fact to the history section, instead of the actual valuation. <ref>{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Brian|title=The Hottest Start Ups of 2015|url=http://www.forbes.com/pictures/eimh45ehmdj/23-beepi/|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=17 December 2015}}</ref> The information he dismisses from Forbes as an unworthy "passing mention"  is actually the first fact on the page that names Beepi as a "Start Up of the Year" for 2015.  Forbes is known especially for ferreting out financial information, as in the [[Forbes 400]]. The statement that Beepi on one occasion didn't share its valuation should be deleted. It's an irrelevant fact to the company history section given the information was available from a Forbes article the previous month:

:::'''History:''' Delete "he did not disclose the valuation" and add, at end of the paragraph: "The company had a reported valuation of $564 million in December of 2015." <ref>{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Brian|title=The Hottest Start Ups of 2015|url=http://www.forbes.com/pictures/eimh45ehmdj/23-beepi/|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=17 December 2015}}</ref>

:::2. Whether the following sentence be added to History:

:::Beepi was named #23 on Forbes Magazine's list of the hottest start ups of 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Brian|title=The Hottest Start Ups of 2015|url=http://www.forbes.com/pictures/eimh45ehmdj/23-beepi/|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=17 December 2015}}</ref> It was also named #6 on Forbes Magazine's list of the hottest e-commerce start ups of 2015. <ref>{{cite news|last1=Mac|first1=Ryan|title=The Hottest E-Commerce Start Ups of 2015|url=http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdh45efdif/beepi/|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=30 December 2015}}</ref> 

:::[[User:Newtonlee|Newtonlee]] accepted the above request and [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]] rejected it without stating a reason. There are only three leading U.S. based business magazines: Forbes, Fortune and [[Bloomberg Business Week]]. Including that a company was named to a start up of the year list by any of these three sources does not seem to me to be promotional. When a big entertainment magazine named its top 25 young actors or Vanity Fair names the 50 top people in the "New Establishment", these are valid facts to include an article. This is analogous. I'm sure if any of these three sources named Beepi one of the worst start ups of the year, [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]] would want to include that. 

:::3. Whether to include all of the following additions, which were approved by [[User:Newtonlee|Newtonlee]], then not addressed by [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]], except to say he would remove anything from the article that he didn't like.  I'd rather achieve consensus here instead of having an edit war with the article:

:::'''History:''' Beepi's advisory board includes former U.S Treasury Secretary [[Larry Summers]] and former Obama deputy chief of staff [[Jim Messina]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Logan|first1=Bryan|title=This guy was so frustrated about buying a lemon that he vowed to revolutionize used cars|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-beepi-vroom-shift-buying-a-used-car-online-2016-1|accessdate=2 February 2016|publisher=Business Insider|date=1 February 2016}}</ref>

:::'''Services''', last sentence to first paragraph: Ally Financial offers financing directly to the Beepi marketplace.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dexheimer|first1=Elizabeth|title=Ally to Finance Used Cars Bought Online With Beepi Partnership|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-16/ally-to-finance-used-cars-bought-online-with-beepi-partnership|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=Boomberg Business|date=16 December 2015}}</ref>  

:::'''Services''': The New York Times reported that Beepi is among the small group of start ups, leveraging a large network of service providers, who use employees instead of independent contractors, in contrast to the Uber freelancer model. CEO [[Ale Resnik]] said it employs and trains its nation-wide network of auto inspectors because it increases their concern for customer service.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Farhad|first1=Manjoo|title=Start-Ups Finding the Best Employees Are Actually Employed|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/technology/personaltech/start-ups-finding-the-best-employees-are-actually-employed.html?_r=0|accessdate=10 September 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=24 June 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Hovercard (intermediate value theorem).png|thumb|right|Screenshot of Hovercards in use]]
[[mw:Beta Features/Hovercards|Hovercards]] is a feature currently in betatesting. You can test Hovercards by enabling it at [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures]]. When a user hovers over an article link a popup displays the lead text, and when available, the lead image of that article. The WMF has already developed the functionality required to exclude non-free images.

There is currently a proposal at [[WP:Village_pump_(proposals)#Proposal:_Enable_Hovercards_by_default|Village Pump: Enable Hovercards]] on whether we want the feature enabled by default. If you have an opinion on that question, please comment there. The discussion here should focus strictly on interpretation of non-free image policy.

Independent of whether a decision is made to enable Hovercards at this time, is it acceptable to include non-free images in Hovercards? The image would only appear when a user specifically requested a preview of the article containing the image. The image is displayed in a pop up mini-view of the article itself, along with some of the text from the article. It is clearly not being used for a "navigational" purpose. The image is arguably being viewed "in" a stubified version of the article itself, and it is arguably still serving the educational purpose of informing the reader about the topic and the related text that they are viewing in the mini-preview. See the image at right, the Hovercard (bottom center of image) is showing a preview of the [[intermediate value theorem]]. The image in this case is a free image, but it well illustrates how the presence of image in the preview is important to understanding the text.

Would Hovercard article-previews qualify as an acceptable place for non-free images to appear? [[User:Alsee|Alsee]] ([[User talk:Alsee|talk]]) 16:51, 16 March 2016 (UTC)}}

Ok. It's time to get this question settled once and for all, instead of arguing over it with no agreement as we have for the past few months. Greetings, soon to be very miserable uninvolved RfC commenters! This article is about a controversy that broke out over the twitter hashtag #Gamergate. A group of loosely associated people emerged on this hashtag and began coordinating all sorts of stuff. Most notably some pretty extreme online harassment was coordinated, but also email campaigns ostensibly about journalism ethics, campaigns against feminism, donations to video game fundraisers and the like.  The question you need to answer is this: should we refer to these people as part of a 'Gamergate movement?' Do the secondary sources support such a description? If not what would be more accurate to refer to this grouping as? [[User:Brustopher|Brustopher]] ([[User Talk:Brustopher|talk]]) 14:51, 16 March 2016 (UTC)}}

Two editors have removed the image from the article. Justifications of [[User:MONGO]] for removing the image include the edit summaries ''"that will learn em...dont take, possess, send, sell or share images of naked juveniles...its called child pornography"''[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_offender_registries_in_the_United_States&diff=703557924&oldid=703500015] and ''"Youtube clips or screen captures are not reliable sources..."''.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_offender_registries_in_the_United_States&diff=703614576&oldid=703605215] The image in question is a screen capture of sex offender flyer seen in a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FssnkvIBdgg news story] by [[Orlando Sentinel]] which is [[WP:RS]].

This image would serve the readers as it points out that people who are unlikely to sexually attack anyone may be required to register as a sex offender for youthful indiscretion.

<blockquote>'''Proposal C.:''' ''Amway has been described as a pyramid scheme and has been the target of several lawsuits for unfair and deceptive business practices. A 1979 FTC case concluded that while Amway was not a pyramid scheme, the company was guilty of price-fixing, making exaggerated income claims, and selling overpriced products and business support materials to their distributors.[http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2015/03/amway_joke_in_house_of_cards_i.html][http://www.nasdaq.com/article/the-pyramid-scheme-industry-examining-some-legal-and-economic-aspects-of-multi-level-marketing-cm340786][http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/amway-selling-the-dream-of-financial-freedom/][http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/15/opinion/joe-nocera-the-pyramid-scheme-problem.html] In 2010, a class action lawsuit was filed against Amway claiming that the company was running an illegal pyramid scheme.[http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/0811/050.html][http://pyramidschemealert.org/analysis-amway-accused-of-fraud-pays-150-million-wheres-the-ftc-and-doj/] Amway settled the case, paying out $150 million for restitution to consumers and reform costs.

The above discussion relates to the renaming of these articles.  Initially they were named "1 E0 m", "1 E1 m", "1 E2 m", etc.  These were very unhelpful names so the articles were moved to "1 metre", "10 metres", "100 metres", etc. (see [[#Proposal one]] above).  This was an improvement; however, it was not completely satisfactory because it left a couple of issues unresolved.
#This article is not ''about'' 1 metre.  Rather it's about things ranging in length from 1 to 10 metres.  The same goes for other articles in the series.
#These articles are generally quite short.  They'll get even shorter once some of the trivial stuff is removed (e.g. one metre is the length of a side of a one-cubic-metre cube). It would make more sense to merge them but threes (e.g. "1 metre", "10 metres" and "100 metres" to something like "Order of magnitude (1 to 1000 metres)").
Above I have [[#Proposal two|proposed]] a system consistent with other order of magnitude articles whereby these articles are merged in threes to "Order of magnitude (1 to 1000 metres)", "Order of magnitude (1 to 1000 kilometres)", "Order of magnitude (1 to 1000 millimetres)", etc.  The intent behind this RfC is to examine these questions and to come to some resolution.

Here are a couple of sources that make the connection:
*[http://www.thenation.com/article/boycott-divestment-sanctions-movement/] - "﻿Boycotts are not a new tactic for Palestinians. As far back as the 1936–39 revolt against the British Mandate, Palestinians incorporated general strikes and boycotts into their struggle. "
*[https://books.google.com/books?id=uj-vAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT32] gives previous boycotts as historical background.
*[http://monthlyreview.org/2015/06/01/boycott-divestment-and-sanctions-at-ten-years/] "[Ramzi Baroud] reminds readers that Palestinian boycotts have a very long and important history—indeed, back to 1936. The current BDS campaign is an extension of earlier indigenous forms of struggle, and not merely a copy of the South African anti-apartheid movement."

Should the following epigraph, a long direct quote from Lee and Erdmann (1999), and content sourced to Schwartz (1990) and Danley (2005), be included ''in the section lede'' of the  "Safety issues, recalls, and lawsuits" section?

<blockquote>Scholarly work published in the decades after the Pinto’s release have offered summations of the general understanding of the Pinto and the controversy regarding the car's safety performance and risk of fire. Lee and Ermann summarized the popular yet largely erroneous understanding of the issues surrounding the Pinto and related fires.

<blockquote>Conventional wisdom holds that Ford Motor Company decided to rush the Pinto into production in 1970 to compete with compact foreign imports, despite internal pre-production tests that showed gas tank ruptures in low-speed rear-end collisions would produce deadly fires. This decision purportedly derived from an infamous seven-page cost-benefit analysis (the "Grush/Saunby Report" [1973]) that valued human lies at $200,000. Settling burn victims’ lawsuits would have cost $49.5 million, far less than the $137 million needed to make minor corrections. According to this account, the company made an informed, cynical, and impressively coordinated decision that "payouts" (Kelman and Hamilton 1989:311) to families of burn victims were more cost-effective than improving fuel tank integrity. This description provides the unambiguous foundation on which the media and academics have built a Pinto gas tank decision-making narrative.<ref name=L&E>{{cite journal |title=Pinto "Madness," a Flawed Landmark Narrative: An Organizational and Network Analysis |first1=M.T. |last1=Lee |first2=M.D. |last2=Ermann |journal=Social Problems |volume=46 |number=1 |date=Feb 1999}}</ref></blockquote>

Additional misunderstanding surrounds the actual number of fire related deaths related to the fuel system design, "wild and unsupported claims asserted in 'Pinto Madness' and elsewhere",[31] the facts of the two most significant Pinto related legal cases, Grimshaw vs Ford Motor Company and State of Indiana vs Ford Motor Company, the applicable safety standards at the time of design, and the nature of the NHTSA investigations and subsequent vehicle recalls.<ref name=L&E/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Danley|first1=John R|title=Polishing Up the Pinto: Legal Liability, Moral Blame, and Risk|journal=Business Ethics Quarterly|date=2005|volume=15|issue=2|pages=205–236}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Schwartz |first=Gary T. |title=The Myth of the Ford Pinto Case |journal=[[Rutgers Law Review]] |volume=43 |year=1990 |pages=1013–1068 |url=http://www.pointoflaw.com/articles/The_Myth_of_the_Ford_Pinto_Case.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>

Except the social media links the site has none of those mentioned above and so using it only in the end disadvantages the readers here ....., As I said above if the site had more content then I wouldn't have an issue however there's nothing except 4 links so IMHO I don't think the site should be included),<br />

Opinions are needed on whether or not the "Domestic violence affects men, women, and children." sentence [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domestic_violence&oldid=710961063 in the lead] is redundant. One concern is that the sentence is redundant to what the first paragraph states because it is easy to see from the first paragraph that domestic violence affects men, women and children, and that the sentence is at conflict with what was the [[topic sentence]] in the third paragraph. The other concerns are that redundancy is an opinion, and that, even if the content is redundant, we can state the same thing more than once in the lead, and that the first paragraph doesn't use the word ''affects''.

Should the use of WP: shortcuts to point to user essays in userspace be deprecated?

'''Discussion'''

Despite the declaration on [[WP:SHORTCUT]] that '''[[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines#Adherence|The existence of a shortcut does not imply or prove that the linked page is a policy or guideline]].''' that disclaimer is not visible to anybody clicking on a shortcut. They arrive at the user essay with the mistaken impression that the user essay is actually a guideline carrying much more weight than it actually does. Even if the essay actually represented a community approved guideline having it in userspace would imply some [[WP:OWN|ownership]] of the guideline. In either case the shortcut is unintentionally and unnecessarily misleading.

I propose deprecating the use of WP: shortcuts to point at user essays in userspace.

Existing shortcuts should be replaced with a short page containing the disclaimer above with a link to the essay. If the essay passes an RfC and is accepted by the community then the shortcut should be replaced by the essay or a redirect to its approved version in WP: namespace.

In the aftermath of the [[2016 Brussels bombings]], we have encountered a recurring dispute, namely: is there any use to be had in lists of world leaders' responses to high profile terrorist attacks like this? In the case of the Brussels attack, we have ended up with a separate article, [[Reactions to the 2016 Brussels bombings]]. There are several other articles like this (see the relevant category here:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Reactions_to_terrorist_attacks]). Now, while it's all well and good that Obama, David Cameron, Shinzo Abe, etc., have condemned the attacks in Brussels, did anyone think they wouldn't? Does anyone need to read the "response" article to know what the responses are going to be? I would argue that they don't. And consequently, the responses aren't notable. At the very least, ''all of them'' aren't notable. If we want to write something like "the attacks generated condemnation from world leaders", fine, but do we need the specific press release from the Latvian government? The response pages quickly become a collection of quotes and tend to promote a form of political pageantry. I would argue that that's not the purpose of Wikipedia. Now, I've never proposed a policy change before, so I welcome assistance/corrections in wording or procedure, but here it is. 

PROPOSAL: We adopt a policy by which the responses from world leaders to high profile terror attacks are not notable and (a) don't get their own articles and (b) don't take up large sections of the article about the attacks themselves.

Should the wiki article include a mention of the study on fans?  To be clear, I don't think anyone is advocating including a statement that fans reduce the risk of SIDS in the wiki article, as high-quality secondary sources do not make that claim.  Instead, the question is whether it is appropriate, in some form, to include a mention of the fact that this study was done (including its limitations), or whether the existence of the study cannot be mentioned at all. High quality secondary sources discuss the findings of the study, so they would be the basis of its inclusion. [[User:Wpegden|Wpegden]] ([[User talk:Wpegden|talk]]) 18:18, 18 April 2016 (UTC)}}

I am now aware that multiple people have commented asking me to extend this [[WP:RFC]] and that it has been put on Phabricator ({{tracked|T131177}}). I see on Phabricator that they are waiting for some new system to be made that will work better and be deployed be default on all wikis. It has been suggested to advertise in more places. I propose that we don't wait for Phabricator and change it on our wiki now. I am posting two surveys one for now waiting for Phabricator and one for the overall topic.

I suppose this question has probably asked before but I'm asking it anyway (philosophers will lose jobs if they are not allowed to do so.) So, are there deadlines for pages in the draft namespace? I thought there isn't one and some agree but some other disagree; cf. [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Draft:Moduli stack of elliptic curves]].

We might be able to agree that, say, a 90% complete draft can stay in the draft namespace; for example, the author is a perfectionist and doesn't want to move it to the main namespace unless it's really really complete. I think articles like that can and should stay in the draft namespace. What about one sentence page? A page with only outlines? If there are ''potentials'' for them to become main-namespace articles (e.g., passes notability), then I'm of the opinion that drafts like those can and should stay in the draft namespace. Because, why delete?, which is simply a counterproductive action. In my personal case, I'm in the middle of finishing my Ph.D. thesis and have no time to develop some of very-short drafts but I don't want them to be deleted (since I need to recreate them later.) Why must those drafts be deleted? For what end?

Should old user space drafts have an expiration date? [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:User_pages&oldid=711732169 Currently], [[WP:STALEDRAFT]] lists six specific actions that may be performed, with an ''implied'' default to keep the user draft indefinitely if its content falls into none of those six criteria. The purpose of this RfC is to establish if there is consensus to change the guideline to eventually delete user space drafts, either at MfD or some sort of [[WP:G13|timed default-delete]] criterion. Previous, closely related discussions have ranged about a bit, so I think it would be helpful if this discussion were kept as close to a binary yes/no as possible.

{{rfcquote|text=
It is a fairly long established norm, I believe, that all High Schools (or national equivalents) which can be independently verified as being genuine, are considered notable.  [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Good_Shepherd_English_School]] seems to be trying to set a precedent for suggesting that as [[WP:SCHOOLOUTCOMES]] does not have the status of policy, it is being used rather than the [[WP:GNG]] in AfD discussions [and should not be]. It seems to me that this would be quite a significant change to the way school pages are treated and therefore suggest that we're probably better off with having a RfC rather than potentially complicated individual DRV. 

I'd like to put my cards on the table as someone who believes that [[WP:SCHOOLOUTCOMES]] is a useful way to make assessments about these kinds of pages. My reasoning is this: ''if'' a school exists (and we can find some evidence from an independent secondary source that it does exist), then this is indicative that there must also be a whole lot of other official paperwork associated with it which may be difficult to find and assess during the period of an AfD discussion. It seems to me that the only situation where there is ''zero official paperwork'' for an alleged school would be when it doesn't actually exist and therefore the page is a hoax. 

Second, I think it is highly unlikely that many secondary/high schools in much of the world get the kind of newspaper or book coverage that we might normally expect to see to assess the notability of a person or other kind of organisation. So if we're really going to be looking for in-depth coverage of an individual school - that we can easily find on the internet - then we're basically whistling for much of the world and wikipedia will remain as a bastion of information about English speaking Europe and North America.  Is there anything really more notable about [[Eton College]] than [[École Normale Hébraïque]]? Yes, there are likely books and newspaper articles regularly written about the former and none on the latter, but is that really the kind of [[WP:BIAS]] we want to encourage here?

Third, I think we're into difficult territory if we're going to start saying that categories of long-established notability consensus are somehow now not notable.  Because that moves us out of talking about schools and into talking about (for example) [[WP:STATION]] and a whole bunch of other common outcomes.  Again, I believe that these make sense, for example for train stations because in order to build and run a train station there must have been a whole lot of organisation and official paperwork which ''would'' show notability even if we can't actually put our hand on it over the internet.

:'''1. Is Tesla's ethnicity unknown according to known sources?'''
:'''2. Should the article state that his ethnicity is a disputed question?'''
:'''3. Are secondary sources which use primary sources as a reference more valuable than secondary sources which provide just a statement "Tesla's ethnicity is X"? What should be done if all source on this matter provide nothing more than statements not founded in reliable primary sources? Can Wikipedia make a decision that one group of sources are more valuable than the other based solely on the quantity, something that scientific and logical approach does not approve? How to establish that quantity? And more extremely, can Wikipedia then declare one group of sources not only to be more valuable that the other group, but to be entirely correct and another group to be entirely incorrect and  completely leave them out of article? 16:27, 27 April 2016 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
As someone who knows that the world wide web actually is, including its differences from the internet, I am at a loss as to how increasingly many products are technically classed as web content, even if they are not web content at all by definition. As if how it's distributed somehow changes what it actually is. I simply do not understand footnote #1; is it saying that if it's not available in a shop, then it's web content, regardless of what is it? I've removed several A7 tags from articles about computer programs that are mainly, if not only available via the web, but according to this guideline, I was wrong to do so ([[WP:A7]] links to this guideline), even though they're not in themselves web content (I'm talking here of things such as Android apps). A computer program is a computer program, regardless of how it's distributed. Under that rule, with the ever-growing use of the web as it slowly but surely replaces physical shops, it won't be that long before pretty much everything is classed as web content, even if it has nothing to do with the world wide web, but merely distributed via it. The web is already the primary, if not sole distribution medium for many products. If it's not actually on the web, it shouldn't come under here, but rather, [[WP:NPRODUCT]] or [[WP:NSOFTWARE]]. It's already extremely difficult, if not impossible to get many common programs (such as web browsers) from anywhere but the web, are they classed as web content? I'm also talking about other products that are available primarily/only via the web; it's just that I'm more familiar with computer programs that other types of product. Web content should mean just that; content that is accessed '''''and used''''' via the web (things like websites, blogs, youtube videos/channels etc, and note I said the ''web'', not the internet), otherwise the term "web content" as it's currently used is misleading. To sum up, if something's a product, it should come under the products guideline, regardless of how it's distributed. What are your thoughts on this?

There has been some discussion of what to do with abandoned pages (e.g. attempts at articles) in the user space of users who are not active. An example: a user registers an account, creates an article which is nowhere near ready for main space due to sourcing issues, and never edits again. There has been some drama about attempts to get rid of these articles. PROD looks like a good candidate for this housekeeping because of the lightweight process and the easy and uncontentious route to restoration. I therefore propose the following change to PROD:
:PROD is only applicable to [[Wikipedia:Main namespace|mainspace]] [[Wikipedia:What is an article?|articles]], [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (lists)|lists]], and [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation|disambiguation pages]]; it cannot be used with [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirects]], [[Wikipedia:User pages|userspace]] pages, [[Wikipedia:Template namespace|templates]], [[Wikipedia:Categorization|categories]], or pages in any other [[Wikipedia:Namespace|namespace]].

The article's current title does not follow [[WP:COMMON NAME]] or [[WP:CONCISE]]. I am proposing that the content of this article and the article on the pre-Franco party, [[Falange Española de las JONS]], be merged and moved into an article titled "Falange" for both the reasons just given and the reasons given below.

[[Brittanica]] calls this political party the Falange (http://www.britannica.com/topic/Falange). Brittanica says the party was founded in 1933, meaning that it does not regard the pre-Franco party as a separate party, whereas this article is on the party when Franco took over and there is another article on the pre-Franco party.

There are also many books that refer to the party as the Falange, the following are ten books refer to the party as the Falange, and this list is not exhaustive:

- ''Encyclopedia of Politics: The Left and the Right''

I am turning to you for your unbiased and professional opinion about an edit on this article which concerns the archaeological site, Emmaus Nicopolis, a place in Israel, and where I have suggested a more neutral edit so as to read: "The site today is inside Canada Park and is maintained by the Jewish National Fund of Canada," as opposed to the current edit that reads: "The site today is inside Canada Park in the West Bank, and maintained by the Jewish National Fund of Canada." As it stands, people who espouse to the view that "Israel is an illegal occupant" have joined in on the Talk-Page discussion to voice their general disapproval at implying that the archaeological site is in Israel, while Jewish participants (including myself) have wanted to omit the words "West Bank" in the article, that is to say, to keep it neutral, without mentioning Israel, neither the West Bank. What do you think we should do with respect to this edit? Can you give your advice on how we ought to proceed and to reach a compromise? Simply put, is it wise to mention areas now fully under Jewish legal control and jurisdiction as only having been held by the Arab Legion of Jordan from 1948-1967, in other words, what some call the "West Bank", and with no mention of Israel? Emmaus is situated in the very center of Israel, the heart of Israel. In government circles, there is no discussion at all, no dialogue, to make the place negotiable for a return under Arab-rule or hegemony, since "Area C" in the Oslo II Accords (where the site is located) is clearly defined as remaining under "full Israeli civil and security control." It's non-negotiable. Any emphasis on "West-Bank" as being the location of this place would, in my mind, conjure-up an editor who wants to relive the past, but forget the present status of the place. A neutral edit, I think, would avoid any misconceptions about the current status of the place.[[User:Davidbena|Davidbena]] ([[User talk:Davidbena|talk]]) 00:32, 7 April 2016 (UTC)}}

'''Background''': The issue with [[WP:STALEDRAFT]] was apparently long-term. There were various changes to the policy, whether it was good or bad, community-vetted or not is now out of the question, since we're making this RfC. There have been moves across namespaces under the guise of "improvement", "more attention" and such. Again, whether they were right or wrong or if there was any actual improvement or not is not the question here. The consensus developed in this RfC will be the way to go forward. --<span style="font-family:'Tahoma',Geneva,sans-serif">[[User:QEDK|QEDK]] <small>([[User talk:QEDK|<span style="color:orange">T</span>]] &#9749; [[Special:Contributions/QEDK|<span style="color:green">C</span>]])</small></span> 10:53, 7 April 2016 (UTC)}}

Should the following, bolded for clarity, be added to [[ExxonMobil climate change controversy]]?

Exxon also studied ways of avoiding {{CO2}} emissions if the [[East Natuna gas field|East Natuna gas field (Natuna D-Alpha block)]] offshore of Indonesia were developed. '''An October 1984 internal report from Exxon's top climate modelers said that the gas field contained over 70% carbon dioxide and that if the carbon dioxide were released to the atmosphere it would make the gas field "the world's largest point source emitter of {{CO2}} and raises concern for the possible incremental impact of Natuna on the CO2 greenhouse problem." Members of Exxon's board of directors told Exxon staff that the gas field could not be developed without a cost-effective and environmentally responsible method for handling the {{CO2}}.'''

Some Exxon directors accepted the emerging climate consensus. Others were less sure of the science, but agreed that as popular attention to global warming mounted, releasing Natuna's greenhouse gases into the air could turn into a public relations debacle, former employees said. Either way, directors repeatedly told project staff Natuna could not proceed unless the CO2 was handled in a cost-effective way that did not harm the atmosphere. "Their concerns kept getting stronger," said a former employee with knowledge of the project, who asked for anonymity because the issue remains sensitive even years later. "Their attitude went from, 'Maybe we have to remove the CO2,' to, as the years went by, their saying, 'This project cannot go ahead unless we remove the CO2.'"}}

Hello everyone,

According to [[Special:Permalink/712675628|a test case compiled by User:Trappist the monk]], out of 23 templates that implement the [[WP:CS1|CS1 citation sytle]], 17 of them place the publisher name (from {{para|publisher}}) between parentheses when there is a work title (from {{para|work}} or its numerous aliases like {{para|newspaper}}, {{para|website}}, etc.) In addition, {{tl|Citation}} also does this (with or without {{para|mode|cs1}}.) In all 24 cases, the parentheses do not appear when there is no work title.

The question is: Should we change the remaining 6 to adhere to this already-dominant style? In this discussion your verdicts may be:
# '''Support adding parentheses to 6 templates''' — Certainly one style (CS1) can only have one form used consistently, not two inconsistent forms for no reason whatsoever. Templates that need to be changed are {{tl|Cite web}}, {{tl|Cite encyclopedia}}, {{tl|Cite mailing list}}, {{tl|Cite newsgroup}}, {{tl|Cite press release}}, and {{tl|Cite podcast}}.
# '''Support removing parentheses from 18 templates''' — Templates that need to be changed are: {{tl|Cite AV media}}, {{tl|Cite AV media notes}}, {{tl|Cite book}},  {{tl|Cite conference}}, {{tl|cite DVD notes}}, {{tl|Cite episode}}, {{tl|Cite interview}}, {{tl|Cite journal}}, {{tl|Cite magazine}}, {{tl|Cite map}}, {{tl|Cite news}}, {{tl|Cite report}}, {{tl|Cite serial}}, {{tl|Cite sign}}, {{tl|Cite speech}}, {{tl|Cite techreport}}, {{tl|Cite thesis}}, {{tl|Citation}} (when {{para|mode|cs1}} is set)
# '''Retain status quo''' — in case you have a genius reason as to why consistency among different template ''implementing the same style'' must not be established. 

I'd like to invite the people already in the discussion to participate: {{u|Jonesey95}}, {{u|Jc3s5h}}, {{u|Redrose64}}, {{u|Trappist the monk}}, {{u|Imzadi1979}}, {{u|Izno}}, {{u|Nikkimaria}}

Hey all. For years we regularly get questions at various fora about maintenance template removal. (In fact, a few questions related to this issue were posted today ([[Wikipedia:Help desk#Ask for help|1]], [[Wikipedia:Teahouse/Questions#how to link up two articles?|2]].) The questions we often receive show that: 
*i) it is not obvious to many that maintenance templates are placed and removed manually. Many people assume there’s some mysterious automated threshold or A.I. program that governs removal; 
*ii) some people seem put off from helping out in the first place—refrain from tackling the problem the template flags—because the process of template removal is neither obvious nor transparent;  
*iii) because there’s nothing in the display of most templates to indicate to the reader that they can dive in to help, and no link to a page explaining the process (as proposed here), they assume it’s some job for an elite class of user (and so we lose the desperate help we need from the masses); and
*iv) people often do not grasp what needs to be done to address the issue flagged by the template, despite the links in them.
So, I’ve drafted [[Help:Maintenance template removal]]. The intent is that we ''add to the display of a variety of maintenance templates'' the following text, linked to this help page:
:* <span style="font-size:70%>[[Help:Maintenance template removal|Learn how and when to remove this template message]].</span>
I’ve spent a lot of time at this help page not just describing the ins and outs of the removal process, but a section addressing some some of our more important and high-use templates — explaining the issues involved, relevant guidelines and policies, and what needs to be done before removal.

If consensus is gained to add such a proposed link to maintenance templates, whether as currently drafted or as suggested after discussion, I will need some help from the more tech-savvy as to the proper way to incorporate the link into the templates. Right now my manner of adding it, as seen in the <nowiki>{{unreferenced}}</nowiki> example I used at the help page, does not play well with that template’s date parameter (“April 2016”), which should appear after the main text, not after the proposed link.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 01:57, 10 April 2016 (UTC)}}

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
{{tl|Infobox film}} states "''Insert the approximate production budget of the film. This is the cost of the actual filming, and does not include marketing/promotional costs (e.g. advertisements, commercials, posters) ... If there are conflicting estimates, do not cherry-pick; list each estimate either as an individual value or as a number range.''"

Film budgets are not usually released by film studios, but generally entertainment magazines and trade journals can obtain an approximate figure from industry insiders. The "budget" is usually taken to be the "negative cost" which is is generally defined as the costs incurred up to producing a negative, but will omit the distribution costs and profit participation for the stars. Sources will usually distinguish between the negative cost and the subsequent costs, such as ''[http://variety.com/2012/film/news/disney-to-finally-unleash-john-carter-1118051102/ Variety]'' observing "''the budget, which Disney quotes at around $250 million, with an additional $100 million to market the film worldwide''". If different sources provide different figures then these figures are represented as a range.

What is not so clear is how to represent figures that incorporate a tax credit and it is this quandary that is the subject of several ongoing film related discussions at [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Film#Film_budget_representation_in_infobox]]. For example, in the case of ''John Carter'' ''[http://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2014/10/22/revealed-the-307-million-cost-of-disneys-john-carter/2/#31f7d52e69d0 Forbes]'' obtained financial documents from the UK treasury which revealed "'''''Total costs''' came to $306.6 million ... The financial statements reveal that the British tax authority handed Disney $42.9 million (£27.1 million) to make John Carter ... The tax payment to John Carter gave the picture a '''net budget''' of $263.7 million which is far more than estimates predicted.''" Disney is on record as stating the budget is "[http://variety.com/2012/film/news/disney-to-finally-unleash-john-carter-1118051102/ around $250 million]".

The question being posed by this RFC is what should go in the infobox? These seem like the viable options to me:
#'''$250 million''' (EDIT: the cost as stated by Disney and widely reported at the time)
#'''$306.6 million''' (the total costs filed at HMRC)
#'''$263.7 million''' (the net budget, which is derived by subtracting the tax credit)
#'''$306.6 million ($263.7 million after tax credit)''' (the bit in brackets could actually go in brackets or as a footnote to avoid clutter)
#'''$263.7 million ($306.6 million before tax credit)'''
#'''$250–306.6 million ($263.7 million after tax credit)'''
#'''$250–306.6 million''' (the highest and lowest figure available)

Even though the discussions are spread over quite few articles they seem to be going in circles and would benefit from community input, which is the reason for the RFC. I think this article is the best "test case" for the RFC since it has some fairly concrete numbers and uses explicit terminology in how those numbers are delivered, such as an official statement on the finance by Disney, and exact details of the tax filings at HMRC.

The decision taken in the above [[Talk:Laura_Branigan#Consensus_discussion|Consensus discussion]] has been challenged. Additional sources have been presented suggesting a 1952 birth date. As such, the community is asked to decide whether the additional sources now listed in [[Talk:Laura_Branigan#1952_sources]] are [[WP:RS|reliable]] to the extent that the previous decision of "'''1957 with a footnote'''" should be overturned.

As there are two options that could replace that decision (no date at all, footnoted or both dates, footnoted) I would suggest that to keep the discussion simple, '''editors should respond with "support" or "overturn"''' the consensus found above.

Whichever decision is taken, appropriate text will have to be crafted. --[[User:Dweller|Dweller]] ([[User talk:Dweller|talk]]) <small>Become [[User:Dweller/Old Fashioned Wikipedian Values|old fashioned!]]</small> 08:02, 13 April 2016 (UTC)}}

There has a been string of comments on the Talk page discussing the nonsense of the current page name for the frisbee, given that frisbee, while originally a brand name, continues to be the universally accepted generic word for thrown toy discs. (The article was originally called Frisbee, but changed in an apparent attempt to help influence real world adoption of the term 'flying disc'. That hasn't happened, but in any case, Wikipedia articles should not be edited in an attempt to influence external circumstances. Consequently I propose '''RENAME'''.

It is time to bring further eyes to review this article. I have several concerns that cannot be resolved with the contributing editor.
:(1) the inclusion of alleged offensive and intimidating language which was denied by the subject, unsubstantiated and dismissed by a court. 
:(2) the inclusion of very minor traffic offences, such as an illegal U-turn, which appear to breach BLP considerations. 
:(3) a highly detailed list, including ABN and ACN, of every company with which the subject has been associated. 
I acknowledge that the subject has had a colorful and contentious past, however, much detail in the article seems trivial and muck-raking. Comments? Thanks, [[User:WWGB|WWGB]] ([[User talk:WWGB|talk]]) 05:49, 14 May 2016 (UTC)}}

Notoriously, Seymour was only 15 when she dated and subsequently moved in with her 41 year old modeling agent John Casablanca.

The above discussion on popular culture has highlighted a fervent but inchoate mix of ideas among editors as to the status of EHS, a mess which is preventing progress in that discussion. The present RfC is aimed at clearing this up. The issue may also be complicated by the fact that claimed sufferers of EHS fall into two groups, those who have misdiagnosed some real symptom caused by something else and those who have worried themselves into developing adverse symptoms via the [[nocebo effect]]. I would ask for comments on two issues:
#'''Is EHS a medical topic?''' Note that it is generally <s>accepted</s> classed as an alternative diagnosis, i.e. the condition has no medical recognition.
#'''Is EHS pseudoscience?''' Note that several other alternative diagnoses based on unsound ideas such as [[Leaky gut syndrome]], [[Drapetomania]] and [[Mucoid plaque]] are currently categorised as such.

'''This should be changed because:'''

1. 972mag.com grossly misquoted both the source it refrences in its own article, and the minister himself by mistaking the hebrew word for “thwarting” {{Hebrew|1=<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif">”</span> סיכול <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif">“</span>}}, for the word “elimination” {{Hebrew|1=<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif">”</span> חיסול <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif">“</span>}}. Therefore the source should be removed completely and changed to the original source Ynet so to maintain the integrity of this wikipedia article.

2. The source should be changed from the 972mag.com to the actual video recording of the quote in question. '''Reference to quotes are not subject to interpretation''' when they are in their original context, and thus should be made directly to the source if available, in order avoid violating the Wikipedia.org sourcing policy.

3. Changed "puns on the Hebrew word" to "play on the Hebrew term...".

4. Added context for the full quote by [[Yisrael Katz (politician born 1955)|Yisrael Katz]], where he elaborates on his use of the term. 

5. References to Yisrael Katz wiki page, so not to be confused with former Minister of Labour and Social Welfare also of the name Yisrael Katz.

6. Added link to Youtube video of interview containing english transcription.

{{rfcquote|text=
There has been a long-running dispute relating to the status of the Zahiri school. It seems to have arrived at a consensus with respect to the [[Zahiri]] article, but we still have a disagreement about presentation in this template. There are two relevant areas of controversy:

# Encyclopedias and general histories commonly refer to the Zahiri madhhab as "extinct" or "defunct", while other sources cited in the article note that the modern Ahl-i-Hadith movement "consciously identified themselves with Zahiri doctrine", and that the maddhab is "prominent" among Salafis, though it is "not formally operating today". 
# While there is argeement that the Zahiri school was historically considered part of the Sunni legal community, some sources state that it was then "excluded from the Sunni consensus". It was conspicuously listed apart from the Sunni madhhabs in the [[Amman Message]], and we haven't been able to find a RS that explicitly refers to its modern form as "Sunni".

The question is how the Sunni Islam template should be designed in view of the above. Here are the options which have been floated:

# Leave the template as it is.
# Move Zahiri under "extinct"
# Move Zahiri on its own line with "disputed" in parentheses.
# Rename the "extinct" subsection to "other" and move Zahiri there.
# Remove Zahiri from this template altogether.

This has [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam_Warlock&type=revision&diff=537975092&oldid=537949399 come up before], but [[User:Arionapollo]] has brought this up on [[User talk:Argento Surfer#Adam Warlock|my talk page]] and I thought I'd invite more voices to the table since this could apply to other characters as well.

Basically, the [[Adam Warlock]] publication history currently says "The character debuted in Fantastic Four #66-67 ... [and had] a second appearance as "Him" in Thor #165-166" Arionapollo, citing CGC and Overstreet, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam_Warlock&type=revision&diff=719894035&oldid=719888695 wants to note] the ''Fantastic Four'' issues are a cameo, and specify the character's "first full appearance" as the ''Thor'' issues. However, 
* The FF issues present his origin in full. 
* Old ''Wizard'' magazines note that FF 66 is a cameo, and FF67 is the first appearance. 
* Marvel says his first appearance was [http://marvel.com/universe/Warlock,_Adam FF 66]. 
* There was a 2 year gap between the FF and Thor stories. 

I think the current wording is sufficiently generic, and avoids making a judgment on what's a cameo and what's a true first appearance. Google [https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=adam+warlock+first+appearance+thor+165 provides some additional support] for the Thor books, but all the top hits are from sites promoting the book for its sale value. 

[[Venom (comics)]] gives his first appearance as ASM #300, and specifies in the publication history he appeared in cameo on the last page of #299. 
[[Apocalypse (comics)]] gives his first appearance as X-Factor #5 in the lead, and the infobox specifies #5 was "in shadow" and #6 was "first full appearance". 
The lead and PH of [[Wolverine (character)]] mentions Hulk 180 as his "first appearance" and Hulk 181 as his "first full appearance". The infobox has Hulk 180 listed as a cameo.

# Should the publication history section or infobox distinguish between cameos and first appearances?
# Is this disagreement significant enough to discuss within the article?

Historical Biblical Archaeology and the Future: The New Pragmatism. Ed. Thomas Evan. Levy. London: Equinox Pub., 2010. "Much work continues to be done in these regions, and not surprisingly this work is now of great interest to those studying the southern Levant (i.e. the region formerly identified as Syria-Palestine and including Canaan)...Nevertheless, despite such a well-reasoned basis for the identification of Levantine archaeology, the adoption of this term by many scholars has been, for the most part, simply the result of individual attempts to consider a wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus than that which is suggested by the use of terms like Canaan,Israel, or even Syria-Palestine. Regardless of the manner in which the term has come into common use, for a couple of additional reasons it seems clear that the Levant will remain the term of choice. In the first place scholars have shown a penchant for the term Levant, despite the fact that the term ‘Syria-Palestine’ has been advocated since the late 1970s. This is evident from the fact that no journal or series today has adopted a title that includes ‘Syria-Palestine’. However, the journal Levant has been published since 1969 and since 1990 Ägypten und Levante has also attracted a plethora of papers relating to the archaeology of this region. Furthermore, a search through any electronic database of titles reveals an overwhelming adoption of the term ‘Levant’ when compared to ‘Syria-Palestine’ for archaeological studies. Undoubtedly, this is mostly due to the fact that ‘Syria-Palestine’ is, correctly speaking, the title for a Roman administrative division of the Levant created by Hadrian (Millar 1993). The term ‘Syria-Palestine’ also carries political overtones that inadvertently evoke current efforts to establish a full-fledged Palestinian state.

{{rfcquote|text=
There has been some confusion as to the purpose of the draft namespace as well as the minimum standard for draft articles. Given this situation, I would like to propose the following standard for the draft articles in the draft namespace.
:''A draft article must clearly indicate the notability of the topic (but not necessary its importance which can be added later.) This requirement can be met, for example, by giving a relevant reference. The draft article should also be written in such a way that it is clear that, some day when it is developed enough, it can be moved to the main namespace.
Since I'm not a native English speaker, please feel free to suggest different phrasing if you can think any. Please also note what is missing. We don't require draft articles to have AfC reviews or some kind of submission procedures. This is very natural; there is no requirement like AfC submissions or deadlines for main space articles and it would be unnatural to demand more ''stringent'' review requirement for draft articles.

My hope is to dispel some confusion like the draft namespace is only for AfC or some other training-wheels-uses, as it is not. Also, most importantly, draft articles should be not deleted unless they fail these community-agreed requirements and not some other ''personal'' requirements editors impose as they feel like. I believe we should agree on ''what'' to delete before we discuss ''how'' to delete them.

As an adult, in 2008, she was "castigated in the British press" over her weight after appearing in a two-piece swimsuit in the [[Caribbean]].  In the aftermath of that, Beatrice said she promised herself she would lose weight. By 2011, the [[Daily Beast]] noted that she'd "lost a ton of weight", quoting one London stylist who noted that "Beatrice can actually fit into many more clothes now".''

There is something wrong when a majority of sources have Clinton's super delegate lead above 500 but we don't. My proposal is that we stop relying on our list, and do what is normally done on Wikipedia by following what the majority of reliable sources say. So I ask the community to please choose on what we should do going forward:

*'''Option A: Retain our list of super delegates (for reference), but go by what a majority of reliable sources are saying as a total.'''

I observe that the text of the External Link to the Act, which I added in conformity with the normal practice for such links, as requested in the header of the meme which I subsequently deleted, states that the text is the current and up to date version. This is generically incorrect in relation to all Acts of Parliament, legislation.gov.uk is kept as up to date as resources and the arrival of new legislation permit, but carries an alert when the Act in question has been altered in some way and the change has not yet been reflected in its pages. You should either detect that in loading the text and alter the wording accordingly, or alter the phrasing to include the word "recently", and possibly add another rider to the effect that the site itself may qualify that.

As is well known, our rules are supposed to codify existing practice. The existing practice for [[WP:NOSHARE]] seems somewhat up in the air, and I'm wondering if the community wants codify this, or double down on the old practice, or what. Therefore I'm raising the a proposal for a change. This is an advisory RfC in that I don't have a strong opinion either way, I am just wanting to gauge the current state of community opinion on a rule that probably was written some time ago, and may have drifted from current practice. [[WP:NOSHARE]] currently reads:
:{{xt|Any user account should represent an individual and not a group (and an individual should normally only have one user account; see next section). Sharing an account – or the password to an account – with others is not permitted, and evidence of doing so will result in the account being blocked.

:{{xt|Exceptions to this rule can be made for non-editing accounts approved to provide email access, accounts approved by the Wikimedia Foundation (see list), and bot accounts that are maintained by more than one contributor, provided the existence of such an arrangement is made clear and has consensus.}}
Here is the proposed change, based on what may be new practice. I've bolded the changes just to highlight them for this RfC, I'm not proposing that they actually be bolded in the text of the rule.

I contest that the journalist is not interpreting the material, but rather summarizing it, also that the author has virtually admitted that the album does follow a semi-coherent narrative structure.--[[User:Ilovetopaint|Ilovetopaint]] ([[User talk:Ilovetopaint|talk]]) 08:00, 29 April 2016 (UTC)}}

There have been disputes on several articles changing the grosses in charts to the all-time grosses (thus incorporating reissue grosses). For example, on its original 1982 release E.T grossed $359 million, but that rose to $435 million thanks to two re-releases in 1988 and 2002. The question here is which figure should ideally go in this chart? '''Option 1''': $359 million from the 1982 release; or '''option 2''': $435 million collated from the 1982, 1988 and 2002 releases?

==Background'''

{{see also|Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC 3|Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Archivedotisbot|Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Requests for closure/Archive 14#Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC 3|l3=complete list of related discussions}}
''[[Archive.is]]'' is an archiving service similar to sites like Webcite and the Wayback Machine.  ''archive.is'' is on the en.wikipedia.org [[Wikipedia:Spam-blacklisting]].  This prevents it's use as a reference source URL.

Based on the questions of consensus raised within [[MediaWiki_talk:Spam-blacklist#archive.is|talk Spam-blacklist]], the community should discuss and vote on whether the previous consensus, established in [[Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC 3]], should remain in force.

'''Effect of Blacklisting ("Blocking")'''

Article source links that refer to ''archive.is'' are currently disallowed.  Any edit incorporating a new URL that starts with <code><nowiki>https://archive.is/</nowiki></code>, will result in the editor being returned to their draft changes (''Edit'' view) with a warning notice which reads (in part)
<blockquote>
<div style="background:LightPink">
Your edit was not saved because it contains a new external link to a site registered on Wikipedia's blacklist.<br />
To save your changes now, you must go back and ''remove the blocked link'' (shown below), and then save.<br />
...<br />
</div>
<div style="background:Azure">
The following link has triggered a protection filter: '''archive.is'''
</div>
</blockquote>
([https://imgur.com/NVZxS2n Here is a picture of the entire warning notice]).
The warning notice prevents the change referencing the ''archive.is'' URL from being saved.

'''Previous RFCs'''

For review, there have been three previous RFC on this topic.
* [[Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC]]
* [[Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC 2]]
* [[Wikipedia:Archive.is RFC 3]]
The User is invited to consider them before voting.

'''Instructions'''

To add your vote,
# add a numbered entry under appropriate section like <code><nowiki># short comment. --~~~~</nowiki></code>, or simply <code><nowiki># --~~~~</nowiki></code>.
# (optional) further discussion can be added under the '''''Discussion''''' section.

For example, within the '''''Support Vote''''' section, an entry might read like

I'm trying to reach consensus over which table should be used in the main article. The first, smaller table, includes only the finalists of the merged version. The second includes finalists from the merged version as well as the national finalists of each branch during the cycle. It would be very appreciated if other users would put their imput into this discussion. For the record, I choose '''Table B'''. My logic is that while I agree that tables should be kept consistent to each other, the format of this show itself was vastly different from most other versions. That in itself demands that information be presented differently for a better understanding of the show. It's a bit more information yes, but the presentation of the table (airtade, cycle, winner, runner-up, contestants, number of contestants, destination) is exactly the same. The addition of all the contestants in no way takes away from the validity or accuracy of the information.

Greetings my fellow Wikipedians,

I just stumbled on this article and wanted to request comments on an addition of a section to this article. I am in the process of reading The Firm by [[John Grisham]]. This book, and its film adaptation, makes frequent reference to the Caymans and its establishments; additionally, the book's plot revolves heavily around the islands. I'm also very certain that other books, shows, or movies at least make passing mention of the island. I have seen numerous "In Popular Culture" sections in other articles. For example, take many of the military rank articles. I don't see these, however, on many other kinds of articles, even though they may be beneficial. I feel that is the case here. I'd like to hear other editors' opinions, and would very much like to see this section added here.

Thank you for your time and comments,

An editor altered the meaning behind the highlighting in the "multiple champions" table: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_world_snooker_champions&diff=718323216&oldid=718323069]. Specifically, the highlighting used to indicate that the player will be competing in the next world championship (once the draw is made), is competing in the current world championship once it begins, and competed in the most recent world championship once it ends. And thus the cycle begins again with the next draw. The changes have altered the highlighting to indicate whether a player is now retired or not. The two meanings are not tautological because a retired player can compete in the world championship, and it is possible that a non-retired player does not compete in the world championship (through suspension/illness). Should the highlighting refer to '''option 1''': the player is competing in the current (or most recent) world championship; or '''option 2''': the player is merely "active" on the circuit? I suppose there is also an '''option 3''', which is simply to drop the highlighting altogether. [[User:Betty Logan|Betty Logan]] ([[User talk:Betty Logan|talk]]) 01:30, 3 May 2016 (UTC)}}

{{Anchor|Discussion: Include the MergeHistory tool}}
I suggest that the <code><nowiki>mergehistory</nowiki></code> right also be included. It provides access to [[Special:MergeHistory]] through which [[WP:HM|history merges]] can be performed. 

Unlike manual history merges by admins (which involve a sequence of moves, deletions and undeletions), merges done using MergeHistory are easy to revert. It can only be used for merging histories that run non-parallely and [[Special:Log/merge|log entries]] exactly indicate the timestamp of the latest merged-in edit, making merge acrions easily revertible. MergeHistory can only be used for performing simple history merges. Many (which typically require the deletion of a few redirect edits) woud still require admin intervention. 

<u>Why this is needed?</u> There is a ''huge'' backlog at [[WP:WikiProject History Merge]] that has remained nearly dormant for ''years''. There is also a smaller backlog at [[:Category:Possible cut-and-paste moves]]. These backlogs could benefit from increased attention.

{{rfcquote|text=
This article up until March used to include the World Grand Prix results (the 2015 and 2016 entries in the table) until this was contested by Armbrust. Armbrust [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Open_(snooker)&diff=708032340&oldid=704346010 contested the view that the World Grand Prix was not a rebranded continuation of the World Open, but a new tournament and removed the WGP results]. He provided sources that referred to it as the "inaugural" tournament. This was contested by several editors who pointed out that World Grand Prix held the same spot on the calendar, had the same broadcaster and also used the historic Grand prix/World Open trophy which had the previous winners engraved on the trophy alongside those of the World Grand Prix. An IP editor [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Open_(snooker)&diff=708830190&oldid=708828806 initiated a cut and paste move] which was subsequently reverted. This led to me proposing a rename at [[#Requested move 11 March 2016]] for the article (to move the article to the World Grand Prix page) but the proposed move resulted in a "no consensus".

The question remains over what to do with the World Grand prix results. An IP is persisting in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Open_%28snooker%29&type=revision&diff=718335962&oldid=718070726 removing the results], effectively splitting the World Grand Prix content to its own article. The problem with this is that it has implications for performance table in the player articles. Case in point: if you look at [[Judd_Trump#Performance_and_rankings_timeline]], you will see there is an entry for the World Grand Prix twelve tournaments down the list. This entry combines the World Open and World Grand Prix results as this article did: the problem though is that if a completely new article is created to house the World Grand Prix results the World Open/World Grand Prix entries in the performance tables need to be also split into separate entries too, otherwise the performance tables link to the wrong tournament. Up to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/World_Open_(snooker)&limit=250 250 articles are affected in all].

So there are two options:
* '''No split''' - We retain the status quo in accoridance with the "no consensus" result from the move discussion and house the World Grand Prix results at the World Open article, and thus retaining the internal link integrity.
* '''Split''' - We split out the World Grand Prix results to its own article, but this will necessitate the fixing of the entries in the performance tables at the player articles that are effected by the split.

Currently, the policy states the following about appealing RevDel.
"Actions performed using this tool remain visible in the public logs. They are subject to review by other administrators (who can see redacted material), and to reversal upon clear, wider consensus. As with other administrative tools, good judgment and appropriate use are expected; improper use can lead to sanctions or desysopping."

Additionally, the [[WP:REVDEL#Misuse|section]] on misuse reads:

"Material must be grossly offensive, with little likelihood of significant dissent about its removal. Otherwise it should not be removed."

There was disagreement surrounding a [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive922#BLP_revdel_on_the_Gamergate_Talk_page|recent discussion]] at ANI about how RevDel appeals should take place, and this RfC seeks to make the process more clear. ~ <b>[[User:BU Rob13|Rob]]</b><sup>[[User talk:BU Rob13|Talk]]</sup> 23:26, 3 May 2016 (UTC)}}

Should this article's infobox include Blackstone Group in the "owner" parameter?

I submitted a request to remove Blackstone Group from the infobox (see the [[Talk:Hilton_Worldwide#Request_for_updates_to_infobox|Request for updates to infobox]] section above, or more specifically, the [[Talk:Hilton_Worldwide#Re:_Blackstone_Group|Re: Blackstone Group]] subsection). Hilton Worldwide is a publicly traded company. According to infobox template documentation (bold emphasis mine), we should "Use [the owner] parameter to list ownership percentages for private companies owned by a few key individuals or to list ownership percentages for joint ventures, if applicable. '''Do not use this field for publicly traded companies.''' When listing a company as an owner, use the full legal name of the entity that holds the ownership stake in the article's subject company."

[[User:Toohool]] disagrees with the infobox documentation. [[User:Altamel]] does not feel strongly either way, but offered the following compromise: "perhaps Blackstone Group could be removed from the infobox while writing a sentence in the introduction about Blackstone's plurality ownership stake". I agreed to this compromise. User:Toohool did not accept the compromise, and User:Altamel closed the edit request saying there is no consensus for update the article accordingly.

I think template documentation supports my argument, but Blackstone Group remains in the infobox and I am not willing to edit the article myself given my conflict of interest (see multiple sections above). I would like for more editors to weigh in on this discussion. Thank you in advance. [[User:Inkian Jason|Inkian Jason]] ([[User talk:Inkian Jason|talk]]) 19:55, 5 May 2016 (UTC)}}

There has been considerable edit-warring here lately by an IP removing the UK term. It has been restored by multiple editors.  I see this as a purely behavioural and POV issue, but before going to ANEW would like to confirm consensus from others.

IMHO, both terms are needed and should be used. This is our usual behaviour.

The IP has made similar edits at [[Mars (chocolate bar)]]. They have raised an RfC here to try and discredit a source showing the prior British invention, but that gained no support. They have claimed, incorrectly, that ENGVAR requires the UK alternative name to be removed (obviously it doesn't). They have used a variety of IPs (a large British ISP), but this is just technical and should not be construed as deliberate socking. They have even raised a protected edit request, when the article was protected against their own edit warring.

A common problem I come across while new page patrolling is tagging pages with CSD tags. It's a problem because they can take hours to be deleted. There are so many users who have very lengthy CSD logs with mostly red-links, and the encyclopedia would benefit greatly by allowing editors other than administrators to delete pages. The deletion log is likely the lengthiest log, because hundreds of pages are deleted daily. It's strange that such a common process can only be done by sysops. I'm proposing that these rights be added to the proposed 'deleter' user-group: <code>delete</code>, <s><code>undelete</code> and <code>deleterevision</code></s>. The deletion of articles would also be restricted to pages created in the last 24 hours and with less than a certain number of edits (I propose 15). <span style="font-family:sans-serif; color:red">&mdash; <span style="font-weight:bold">[[User:Music1201|<span style="color:green"> Music1201</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Music1201|<span style="color:red">talk</span>]]</sup></span></span> 03:53, 31 May 2016 (UTC)}}

Per {{U|Oiyarbepsy}}'s [[Template talk:Rfd2#Template produces hopeless technobabble|request to simplify the raw wikitext result of substituting rfd2]], I worked to build {{tl|rfd2 links}} and have implemented its use in {{tl|rfd2/sandbox}}.

When substituted, this sandboxed version of {{tl|rfd2}} leaves {{tlc|rfd2 links}} unsubstituted in place of what is usually a large and complex mess of wikitext markup for various links.

* It is proposed to make this the default configuration for {{tlc|rfd2}}.

There is a concern that whilst {{tlc|rfd2 links}} is transcluded in use, any changes to the template would be reflected in the transclusions, which at any time may be many. It is thus proposed that if this method is employed, {{tlc|rfd2 links}} should be template-protected from the start, and possibly automatically substituted by bot once it's ''archived''. {{u|Anomie}} who operates {{u|AnomieBOT}} (which is currently utilised for auto substitutions) may like to advise? <code class="nowrap" style="background:#DFF"> [[User:Fred Gandt|Fred Gandt]] <small>([[User talk:Fred Gandt|talk]]&#124;[[Special:Contributions/Fred Gandt|contribs]])</small></code> 10:02, 11 May 2016 (UTC)}}

Non-[[WP:AFC|AFC]] drafts in draftspace have no G13 method for automatic deletion or for any review at all. As such, [[User:MusikBot/StaleDrafts/Report|there are hundreds of stale drafts that haven't been edited in a long time]]. Attempts to add G13 or other criteria have been repeatedly and expressly rejected so instead these pages take up a lot of time at [[WP:MFD]] where deletion is somewhat routine. I'd like to propose that we allow for a new draft proposed deletion system with the following rules:
# Draftspace drafts that are not tagged with AFC that haven't been edited in six months can be considered.
# If the deletion is proposed, it would go into a dated category similar to [[:Category:Proposed deletion]] for at least ''one month'' at which time any one can remove the proposal for ''any reason whatsoever''. This is similar to the 5 month notification of [[:Category:AfC G13 eligible soon submissions]] with a month before G13.
# After a month with no deletion, an admin can then decide if it's worth deleting.
I've added header for support as is and a separate support in case people support the general concept but disagree on the six month/one prod timeline. -- [[User:Ricky81682|Ricky81682]] ([[User talk:Ricky81682|talk]]) 21:34, 20 May 2016 (UTC)}}

The name "Persian Gulf" is disputed (see [[Persian Gulf naming dispute]]) and although it is ''widely accepted'' in accordance with WP guidelines [[WP:WIAN]], it is not used by Arab states. A recognised (by BGN, Google maps and various atlases) ''alternative name'' is "Arabian Gulf". As a compromise:
:Should the name be determined by the article content? For example, an article about an Arab entity would use the term "Arabian Gulf", while an article on a Persian/Iranian entity would use "Persian Gulf"?

{{ARBGMO talk notice|style=long}}

This is a '''Request for Comment''', conducted under [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee/Discretionary sanctions|discretionary sanctions issued by the Arbitration Committee]], concerning how to indicate the scientific views on the safety of genetically modified crops for human consumption.

'''Introduction'''

[[#Comments|''Jump to comments section.'']]

'''Purpose of this RfC'''

The following pages are affected by this RfC:
{{cot|List of pages|bg=#F2E0CE}}
*[[Genetically modified food controversies]] (lead and health section)
*[[Genetically modified crops]] (lead and controversy section)
*[[Genetically modified food]] (lead and health and safety section)
*[[Genetically modified organism]] (controversy section)
*[[Genetically modified canola]] (controversy section)
*[[Genetically modified maize]] (controversy section)
*[[Genetically modified soybean]] (controversy section)
*[[March Against Monsanto]] (background section)
*[[Regulation of the release of genetically modified organisms]] (lead)
*[[Biotechnology]] (agriculture section)
*[[Denialism]] (genetically modified foods section)
{{cob}}

Each of these pages has language similar to: {{tq|There is general scientific agreement that food on the market derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but should be tested on a case-by-case basis.}} Editors are generally dissatisfied with this wording, but disagree about how to revise it. '''This RfC presents options for content to replace that wording, and is intended to determine community consensus about that.'''

Specifically, '''you are asked to address two questions''':

1. Based upon the policies, guidelines, and concepts related to [[scientific consensus]], listed [[#Policies, guidelines and essays to keep in mind|below]], do the preponderance of reliable sources (see citations in the [[#Proposals|listed proposals]]) indicate that there is a scientific consensus about the safety of genetically modified food with respect to human health?

2. Should the existing language be changed, and which content [[#Proposals|proposal(s)]], if any, best represent the answer to question 1 for inclusion in the articles listed above?

'''Rules'''

Under the authority granted to Uninvolved Administrators and by the terms of the [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Genetically modified organisms|Arbitration Committee GMO case]], and [[WP:ACDS|Standard Discretionary Sanctions]] as [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Genetically modified organisms#Discretionary Sanctions|authorized by that case]], the following limits are imposed on debate:

*'''All editors are required to maintain a proper level of decorum'''. Unnecessary rudeness, hostility, casting aspersions, and battleground mentality '''will not be tolerated''' here, in the interest of arriving at a clear, fair-minded consensus. Inappropriate conduct may be met with warnings, blocks, or bans from further participation in this RfC as the administrator deems necessary. To foster a collaborative atmosphere, editors are encouraged not to bring statements made here to Arbitration Enforcement, but rather to leave it to the patrolling admins.
*The '''sole purpose''' of this RfC is to determine consensus about a specific question concerning article content. It is not a venue for personal opinions about GMOs in general, nor a place to relitigate past disputes.
*All comments '''must''' be about article ''content'' or the ''content'' of users' proposals. Comments on any contributor, ''ad hominem'', attacks, aspersions, or that are found in any other way to not conform to the standards prescribed herein, '''are prohibited'''. 
**Any violations of these restrictions '''will be reverted, removed, or redacted'''. 
**Violating editors '''will face blocks or discretionary sanctions''', with or without warning and at the discretion of an administrator.
*If you came here because someone asked you to, or you read a message on another website, please note that this is [[Wikipedia:Polling is not a substitute for discussion|'''not a majority vote''']], but instead a ''discussion'' among Wikipedia contributors. Wikipedia has [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|policies and guidelines]] regarding the encyclopedia's content, and [[Wikipedia:Consensus|'''consensus''']] (agreement) is gauged based on the merits of the arguments, not by counting votes.
*If you believe that a user is violating policy or the rules set forth by Arbcom or by this page, and you cannot work it out between yourselves, please speak to an Enforcement admin at their talk page or at ANI, '''not here or on this RFC's talk page'''. If you believe an admin is behaving inappropriately, their decisions may be appealed to [[WP:ANI]], [[WP:AE]] or Arbcom directly.
*Please '''do not make changes''' in proposals that have already been posted. '''Anyone is permitted to post additional proposals''', below the existing proposals.
*'''Threaded discussion is prohibited on the RfC page'''. To comment in the RfC, you '''must''' create '''your own section''' within the [[#Comments|Comments]] section, placing your username in the section header. Within your own section, you may present your opinions on the proposals, and briefly pose questions to other editors or respond to questions from other editors. Do not make "support" or "oppose" comments under each proposal; indicate these opinions instead within your own section. '''Do not make any edits in any other editor's section'''. A section may be edited '''only''' by the editor to whom it corresponds, and by enforcing administrators. Editors are encouraged to discuss and collaborate with one another on the RfC Talk page, where threaded discussion is permitted and there are no word limits.
*In each comment section, each editor is '''strictly limited to 800 words''', including replies to other editors. ([http://wordcounttools.com Word Count Tool]) There will be no exceptions. Excessively long statements will be hatted until shortened.
*{{user|KrakatoaKatie}}, {{user|Nakon}}, and {{user|Deor}}, have agreed to serve as a panel of three experienced, uninvolved editors who will close the RfC after 30 days and determine the consensus (if any). Because this is such a contentious area, the RfC will run for '''the full 30 days''', unless additional time is needed to judge consensus, and closing early as per [[WP:SNOW]] is unlikely.
*The consensus reached (if any) '''will be imposed as a Discretionary Sanction''' on the topic area, broadly construed. It may be overturned only by another widely published full 30-day RfC, a consensus of administrators at [[WP:AE]], or by decree of the Arbitration Committee.

*Nobody is required to participate in this RfC, and anybody may cease participation at any time for any reason. However, it is in everyone's best interest that we solicit a wide range of opinions so that we may achieve a strong consensus.
*Finally, if you have issue with my own conduct or with these rules, we request that you please discuss with us on our own user talk pages before escalating. We am always willing to listen to a reasonable argument.

I don't see the point of A9 any more. Per [[Wikipedia_talk:Credible_claim_of_significance#RfC:_Can_SIGNIFICANCE_be_inherited.3F|this RfC]] having a notable recording artist would likely constitute a [[Wikipedia:Credible claim of significance|credible claim of significance]] anyway (those that have articles tend to be notable), making the no-recording-artist-having-an-article requirement totally redundant. I've seen articles about musical recordings whose artist does have an article tagged A9 when it's clear the artist's article will be deleted (they technically don't meet A9 until it has been deleted). I'm proposing that we scrap that requirement and merge what's left of A9 into A7; it's senseless to have them as separate criteria.

How should the directors of this film be presented in the lead of the article?

For context, the Wachowski Brothers have both come out as transgender women in the time since ''The Matrix'' was released. They are now credited as [[the Wachowskis]], not the Wachowski Brothers.

This is a matter that has been argued over extensively. A 2012 discussion at WikiProject Film ended with the determination that the infobox should reflect names as they appear in the credits, but I have not been able to find any such consensus for anything outside of the infobox.

This template uses a parameter, "end", to display a reason for the termination of a marriage. The template documentation advises that the end date should be the date a marriage was dissolved or the date that the spouse of the article subject died. However, in the event of a marriage ending by the death of the article subject, it is possible to signal that by using "end=widowed", for example <nowiki>{{marriage|Joan Smith|1916|1942|end=widowed}}</nowiki> produces the output "Joan Smith ({{abbr|m.|married}} 1916; {{abbr|wid.|widowed}} 1942)", attempting to indicate that Joan Smith was widowed in 1942.

Per the essay [[Wikipedia:Famous Residents]] I propose that we use these 3 criteria for inclusion on the [[Ipswich]] article:
# Notability: The person must be notable enough to have an article in Wikipedia.
# Residence: The person must be or must have been a true resident of Ipswich itself; not a seasonal or short-term resident; not a resident of a nearby locale or community. Such residence must be verifiable through cited, reliable sources.
# Significance to Ipswich: The person's notability must derive from the location OR the person must have derived the basis for their notability in that location OR the person must hold some significance to the location in general. Examples: an artist who was notable for painting scenes of the town; an author who wrote a book about the town; a singer who developed his/her talent and/or was "discovered" in Ipswich while they were living there; a professional athlete who developed his/her talent in a local athletic team; a mass-murderer who lived in the town when he/she murdered his/her victims; an actor who establishes his/her notability prior to living in the town, but is now a resident who uses his/her notability to benefit local charities or becomes a public servant.

Currently, [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Comics#Titles]] specifies that "comic book series, comic strips and comics publications should be italicized. For the titles of comic book storylines, chapters, comic strip episodes, an individual editorial cartoon or gag panel, editors should use quotation marks." It give as examples:
{{quote|* {{xt|''Identity Crisis''}}, the title of a [[DC Comics]] [[limited series]], should be italicized. {{xt|"Identity Crisis"}}, the title of a Spider-Man storyline that leads to the creation of the [[Slingers]], should be in quotation marks. [...]
* In 2006, Marvel published the {{xt|"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]"}} cross-over event. The flagship title of the event is the limited series {{xt|''Civil War''}}.}}

The MOS does not specify comic-book features. These currently appear generally in quote marks, i.e., the feature "Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD" in ''Strange Tales'' as opposed to the series ''Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD''. (See ''[[Strange Tales]]''.) But this is not formal MOS. How should the MOS address features? --[[User:Tenebrae|Tenebrae]] ([[User talk:Tenebrae|talk]]) 14:34, 11 May 2016 (UTC)}}

With two working demonstrations available, it is requested that the community comment on the possibility of implementing site wide, JavaScript enabled, interactive chess boards for visual demonstration of described ''plays''.

[[User:קיפודנחש|קיפודנחש]] (aka kipod) and [[User:Fred Gandt|Fred Gandt]] (me) have provided example demonstration code:
* [[User:קיפודנחש/pgn viewer demo|kipod's]] takes [[Portable Game Notation]] (PGN) and optional [[Forsyth–Edwards Notation]] (FEN) for non-standard set-up.
** It will output the PGN in a raw format for users with JavaScript disabled.
* [[User:Fred Gandt/sandbox/chessDemo|Fred's]] takes [[Algebraic notation (chess)|algebraic chess notation]] and optional partially plain English instructions for non-standard set-up.
** It will fallback to an animated .gif (if provided) for users with JavaScript disabled.
Both these demonstration examples require the addition of JavaScript to [[Special:MyPage/common.js|your common JS]] to see them. This RfC is to determine if and how such a feature might be woven into the fabric of Wikipedia such that ALL users will see the proposed functionality by default. Please view the demonstration examples in their scripted and unscripted conditions before commenting. Be aware that some [[CSS]] styling is also required, which is imported by the JavaScripts; thus the unscripted display may not be ''exactly'' as intended in any eventual site wide implementation.

As [[WP:INTDAB|INTDAB]] indicates, links in mainspace to disambiguation pages are usually (but not always) wrong. [[User:DPL bot|DPL bot]] does a great job of catching these links when they are added, and letting the editor know on their talk page, but, as [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links]] makes clear, there is significant non-response to these bot messages. It seems to me that we would have greater compliance if we could intercede ''before'' changes are saved.

I propose a high-attention message and two buttons that appear when "Save" is clicked (with the exception of disambiguation pages, which often intentionally link to other disambiguation pages), modeled on DPL bot, e.g.: "You have added [a link{{!}}links] pointing to the disambiguation page[s] [X, Y, and Z]. Such links are almost always unintended, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of "Did you mean..." article titles." Buttons: [Return to edit][Save anyway]. So:

If viewing this from the RfC page or an alert on your talk page, the full discussion starts at [[Talk:Eidetic memory#Eidetic vs. photographic]]. One concern is that "It should be very clear to readers that 'eidetic images' (in psychology) and 'photographic memory' are not the same things. Photographic memory does '''not''' exist, and eidetic images are generally not found in adults and they don't allow people to perform spectacular memory feats. [...] 'Eidetic imagery' in psychology is not 'photographic memory' -- it refers to the brief impression of an image that children sometimes see, and it has '''nothing to do with adults who memorize things'''. There is no science to support that." The other concern is that "'''most of the sources [...] are clear that the terms are used interchangeably''' or that photographic memory and eidetic memory '''are''' the same topic, but that the term ''eidetic memory'' is more accurate; if they distinguish photographic memory and eidetic memory at all, it's only slightly. In other words, sources usually treat these topics side by side and as the same thing while other sources distinguish them or slightly distinguish them."

So the issue is this: Should we be strict in stating that eidetic memory and photographic memory are not the same thing? Or should we should initially treat the terms as the same thing, with "photographic memory" as the [[WP:Alternative title]], and then relay that the terms are sometimes distinguished? Sources for examining the terminological matter are below. I will alert [[WP:WikiProject Psychology]] and [[WP:Biology]] to this discussion.

While eidetic imagery is most likely the source of the concept of a photographic memory, there are differences in the two concepts. An eidetic image fades soon after one sees the original image and does not stay with a person over time. The image is subjective, and the details of greatest interest to the person are the ones most easily reproduced. Moreover, a person cannot form an eidetic image in one second, as a camera can snap a photo; several seconds are required to scan the picture. Once the picture has faded away, eidetic images cannot be retrieved. Those who can form eidetic images do not seem to be able to use their special ability to improve long-term memory.}}

But a true photographic memory in this sense has never been proved to exist. Most of us do have a kind of photographic memory, in that most people's memory for visual material is much better and more detailed than our recall of most other kinds of material.

Per [[Wikipedia:Summary_style#Rationale]], for major topics Wikipedia should ''"distribute information across related articles in a way that can serve readers who want varying amounts of details, thus giving readers the ability to zoom to the level of details they need and not exhausting those who need a primer on a whole topic"''. It goes on to discuss the parent-child article structure. I have tried in different ways to get the community focused on this question for the huge and complex Israel-Palestine topic, but I have continually failed to get a proper discussion going, probably because I have been asking the wrong question. Here is another attempt, with a hopefully better question.

Please could editors comment as to whether you believe that this article should be the overall parent article of the whole conflict, which began in 1917 or 1920 depending which scholar you look at. Proposed options below:
* '''Yes, this article should be the parent article of the whole conflict'''
* '''No, the parent is at another article''' 
* '''No, we don't need a parent article; the split of three top articles is fine'''
