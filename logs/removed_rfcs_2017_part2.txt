{{rfcquote|text=
Based on discussions at [[WP:Requested moves]] and elsewhere, I think the general feeling is that [[WP:BOLD]] should not apply to page moves... moves require incoming links to all be changed, and back-and-forth moves mess up the logs, and sometimes admin action is required to move pages. Therefore I propose adding the following two-sentence paragraph after the end of the second long paragraph in the "Be careful" section (the one that ends "...Always use your very best editorial judgment in these cases and be sure to read the talk page".)

:{{xt|Don't usually make bold page moves. Pages should only be moved without prior discussion if you think no reasonable objection could be made to the new name. See [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]] for instructions on initiating page move proposals.}}

{{rfcquote|text=
We [[Wikipedia_talk:Did_you_know/Archive_139#Admin_responsibility|discussed the role of administrators]] in the DYK promotion process a month or so ago. The [[Wikipedia:Did_you_know/Admin_instructions|DYK admin instructions]] say that admins should check articles for verifiability, BLP, copyright, and image licensing, as well as formatting issues and "hookiness". The previous discussion, linked above, made it quite clear that current practice a) varies considerably, and b) does not always comply with said instructions. Without attempting to apportion any blame, I think we need to redetermine consensus here, so that admins can all follow the same procedure, and so we are clear about responsibilities for problem hooks/articles. As I see it, we have three options, which I have listed below. I would entreat you folks to keep comments on the question at hand, and avoid letting this degenerate into analyses of specific editors.

Does tagging the phrase "comprised of" in a quotation with a hidden sic tag help or harm Wikipedia?

A hidden sic tag is a tag for the "sic" template that uses the hide=y parameter.  It does not affect what a reader sees in any way; it is just used in maintenance of the encyclopedia.  The tag clearly marks a phrase as part of a quotation and confirms that it is correctly quoted.

This is a real issue, as there has been for some time an editor systematically tagging "comprised of" in quotations throughout the encyclopedia and another editor following the first editor and removing the tags.  If we had a consensus on whether the tag is helpful or harmful, these editors could presumably stop this wasteful activity.

{{rfcquote|text=
In the "[[Wikipedia talk:Citation overkill#Citations|Citations]]" discussion above on this talk page, a suggestion was made to include text that encourages more citations. For example, in this discussion, it was suggested that adding a citation after each sentence instead of having one citation at the end of a paragraph supporting the entire paragraph is beneficial, and that the text in the essay that discourages more citations should be replaced with text that encourages more citations. One view is that the essay is specifically about citation overkill (excessive citations) and that it offers leeway for cases where it is best to cite multiple sources, but that excessively citing should generally be discouraged. The other view is that more citations are beneficial; for example, adding a citation for each sentence of a paragraph assures the reader that all of the content is sourced, since readers can otherwise assume that some text is unsourced.

{{rfcquote|text=
We have a page at [[Anti-Hinduism]], and a page at [[Persecution of Hindus]]. These are theoretically distinct topics, in that this page is about Anti-Hindu sentiment, and the other is about physical persecution. This argument has also been made, and has received support, at the most recent deletion discussion for this page.

However, the two pages currently share a fair amount of material. For example, this page contains material about the ''jizya'', or religion-specific tax, applied to by Muslim rulers; which, logically, is a matter of actual persecution, not simply of anti-Hindu sentiment. Conversely, that page contains matters such as Pakistan's curriculum, which is ''not'' directly an instance of persecution, and belongs here.

Therefore, I propose that 1) this page be retitled "anti-Hindu sentiment" to make the scope of the page clear; 2) all content from this page that is about an instance of direct persecution be moved/merged to [[Persecution of Hindus]]; and 3) that all content at [[Persecution of Hindus]] that is not about an instance of direct persecution be moved/merged from there to here.

The consensus at [[WP:UP/RFC2016]] regarding section [[WP:UP/RFC2016#B4|B4]] was:

{{xt|'''B4. When a userspace draft is moved to mainspace by a user other than its author, but is then found to be unsuitable for mainspace for reasons which would not apply in userspace, should it be returned to userspace rather than deleted?'''

Clear consensus in favor of this proposal. The details (who moves what back where and when) should be discussed by the community.}}

I suggest we clarify it to:

''When a userspace draft is moved to the mainspace by a user other than its author, but is then found to be unsuitable for the mainspace for reasons which would not apply in the userspace, it should be returned to {{green|its former location in}} the userspace rather than deleted {{green|or if it has already been deleted}}. {{green|Requests to restore such deleted pages are uncontroversial and may be made by anyone at requests for undeletion}}.''

Secondly, I suggest we document this consensus at [[Help:Userspace draft]] and amend [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion]] accordingly.

Notifications sent out to all participants in section [[WP:UP/RFC2016#B4|B4]] of [[WP:UP/RFC2016]]. Notifications left at [[WT:User pages]], [[WT:Requests for undeletion]], and [[Help talk:Userspace draft]].

{{rfcquote|text=
There are a few things I was hoping to change but I don't think that will be happening with the [[User:‎Asileb]] constantly reverting my edits, despite my good intentions for my edits. The '''first problem''' is the confusing edit of the [[CeCe Peniston discography#Singles|Singles]]. The song "[[Keep Givin' Me Your Love]]" is claimed to have went number 1 on the [[Hot 100]] but there is no record of that. A note states it "denotes Bubbling Under 100 instead", but if this is the case, shouldn't the number "1" be changed to number "101" under that [100] column or just have a " — "? Because right now, that edit is promoting false and confusing info. The '''second issue''' is the abbreviation "DCS" for [[Dance Club Songs]], which I edited to "US Dance" to make it easier on reader to understand the chart meaning, but it was again reverted by [[User:‎Asileb]]. In the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=CeCe_Peniston_discography&action=history page's history], the user commented "No need. The columns have equal width and the abbreviation are used in all the tables.", which seems to imply a bit of [[Wikipedia:Ownership of content#Actions]]. I revised his edit and said "It's a well-known standard to write the word out so readers know what it is. It has nothing to do with perimeters." as when I changed "DCS" → "Dance", none of the columns/rows/perimeters overlapped. The '''last issue''' is the overuse of different color codes on this page. Why are there different colors for??? [[User:Horizonlove|Horizonlove]] ([[User talk:Horizonlove|talk]]) 01:58, 12 June 2017 (UTC)}}

Since an editor has unilaterally decided to delete from the "Post-1967" section of the article the status of Husan after the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]], and which accords had given a certain amount of civil authority to the [[Palestinian Authority]] over Husan, and which information I personally feel should not have been deleted, can we as involved editors (such as editor: [[User:Zero0000]], and others) agree on restoring a modified edit to the section that would mention the current status vis-à-vis Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as outline in brief the relegated responsibilities of each toward the residents of Husan? The second suggestion I would like to make is somewhat more out-of-the-ordinary, and that is, instead of wording the lead paragraph in the section to read: "Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Husan has been under [[Israeli occupation]]" - which edit takes a certain political position with respect to Israel, can we agree by consensus to change this edit to reflect a more neutral point of view, such as: "Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Husan has been under ''de facto'' annexation by Israel." "De facto" means "in fact", as opposed to "de jure", which means "in law". Simply put, a "de facto" annexation means that a piece of land has in fact been annexed to a different country, even though that country may not have made it official. For example, the "occupied territories" that Israel administers after taking them away from Jordan and the Lebanon have been "de facto" annexed to Israel, even though they've not *officially* said "They're now part of Israel." This will, in my humble opinion, lend some balance to the current edit, since, after all, the matter of Israel's presence in its own land is still disputed.[[User:Davidbena|Davidbena]] ([[User talk:Davidbena|talk]]) 22:40, 17 June 2017 (UTC)}}

Please forgive me for locating this RfC in this Wikiproject, but there seems to be no other logical place to put it. The issue is, there is currently not much consistency in the lead sentence in articles on singers who (sometimes) write the songs that they sing. Some will use "singer and songwriter", some "singer-songwriter", and some refer to them only as "singer". I'ld like to check if there is a rough consensus on what to use in the lead sentence in articles on singers who also sometimes write songs (somewhat exclusively) for their own use.

This article should be renamed "Islamic State (''to-be-decided'' qualifier)".

The time has come to accept "Islamic State" as the name of this organization. We should follow [[WP:COMMONNAME]] - common usage is now "Islamic State" typically with some qualifer such as "so-called", "self-declared", "group", "terrorist group" etc. Such usage is now between 4 and 10 times "Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant", so the current title is very and increasingly outdated. This has been researched bountifully before, archived [[Talk:Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant/Archive_37#Requested_move_15_July_2015|here (July 2015)]], again [[Talk:Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant/Archive_28#Requested_move_9_January_2015|here (Jan 2015)]] and more recently [[Talk:Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant/Archive_39#ISIS_vs_ISIL|here (Mar 2017)]], and see table "Google result counts" below.

Key objections from the past discussions (see "previously nominated to be moved" above) have included:

* "Islamic State" has other uses and is too generic: adding " (some qualifier)" deals with this.
* They are neither Islamic nor a State: policy [[WP:TITLECHANGES]] says "the choice of title is not dependent on whether a name is "right" in a moral or political sense.
* NPOV / wikipedia should not be a mouthpiece: how is the current title "Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant" less POV? It still contains the word Islamic, and imho the implicit suggestion that it is just an Iraqi/Levantine version of Islam and other Muslims need not take offence - that really is not OK particularly for the Iraqis, Levantines and Syrians implicated.
* Locals and much American media call them Daesh: that is an abbreviation of an Arabic name, which translates to "al-Dawlah al-Islamīyah fī al-ʻIrāq wa-al-Shām". This is the English Wikipedia, and should [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)|use English]]. If someone wants it to be Daesh, they can raise a separate RfC or move request.
* WP:TITLECHANGES "has been stable a long time" / [[WP:Recentism]]: the name change started 3-4 years ago, the current title has remained for that time, but has been out-dated for a large part of it; it is a mistake to confuse stability with simply avoiding recentism.

The [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2017-06-09/Op-ed|opinion piece]] in the latest ''[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost|Signpost]]'' criticised the trend toward more information included in parentheses in the first sentence of an article. {{u|Piotrus}} suggested an RfC on the matter, so I have opened one, as I don't believe one has been opened yet. Apologies if wrong. 

* Should [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section]] discourage metadata included parenthetically in the first sentence? 
* What kinds of information should be included? 
* How many variants of each kind? Eg, how many languages should the name be listed in the first sentence?
<small>{{flatlist|
* birth and death dates 
* names in other languages
* maiden and other previous names
* pronunciation written in systems like [[jyutping]] and [[pinyin]]
* scientific names
* inline audio files of pronunciation
}}</small>

Current relevant policy:
: '''Foreign language''' If the subject of the article is closely associated with a non-English language, a single foreign language equivalent name can be included in the lead sentence, usually in parentheses.<p>'''Pronunciation''' If the name of the article has a pronunciation that's not apparent from its spelling, include its pronunciation in parentheses after the first occurrence of the name. Most such terms are foreign words or phrases (mate, coup d'état), proper nouns (Ralph Fiennes, Tuolumne River, Tao Te Ching), or very unusual English words (synecdoche, atlatl). Do not include pronunciations for names of foreign countries whose pronunciations are well known in English (France, Poland). Do not include them for common English words with pronunciations that might be counterintuitive for learners (laughter, sword). If the name of the article is more than one word, include pronunciation only for the words that need it unless all are foreign (all of Jean van Heijenoort but only Cholmondeley in Thomas P. G. Cholmondeley). A fuller discussion of pronunciation can come later in the article.<p>'''Biographies''' The opening paragraph should usually have dates of birth and death. Birth and death dates are important information about the person being described, but if they are also mentioned in the body, the vital year range (in brackets after the person's full name) may be sufficient to provide context. Birth and death places, if known, should be mentioned in the body of the article, and can be in the lead if relevant to the person's notability, but they should not be mentioned in the opening brackets of the lead sentence alongside the birth and death dates. In some cases, subjects have legally changed their names at some point after birth. In these cases the birth name should be given as well. In the case of transgender and non-binary people, birth names should be included in the lead sentence only when the person was notable prior to coming out. It is common to give the maiden name (birth name) of a woman better known under her married name. <p>'''Organisms''' When a common (vernacular) name is used as the article title, the boldfaced common name is followed by the italic un-boldfaced scientific name in round parentheses in the opening sentence of the lead.

Looking for a ruling on the quality of references which can be used on detail articles, i.e. most of the articles linked to in this template. Placed here because it applies to all.

Question revolves around use of social media sites as reliable sources. It has been previously established that social media can be a reliable source, depending on the context: [[Wikipedia_talk:Verifiability/Archive_65#Reliability_of_social_media_sources_representing_companies]]

Further, [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Access_to_sources]] says:
    "Some reliable sources may not be easily accessible. For example, an online source may require payment, and a print-only source may be available only in university libraries. Do not reject reliable sources just because they are difficult or costly to access. If you have trouble accessing a source, others may be able to do so on your behalf (see WikiProject Resource Exchange)."
So therefore, a locked facebook group (and posts within) is no more or less reliable than an open group, and the group being closed is not in and of itself a reason to reject a source.

'''Item 1'''

If "Verified Expert X" uses their verified Facebook account to discuss the topic they are an expert in, then that specific post should be considered a reliable source? How is it any different to the above case study with the Yarra Valley Railway's facebook page, which can be manually verified by checking previous posts for legitimate content?

'''Item 2'''

Where should I list the personal facebook accounts which are controlled by people who are experts in this field as established by previous published works etc? For example, Daryl Gregory, who (in conjunction with others) published the books used as definitive sources for most of these articles. I'd posit that posts made by his facebook account should qualify as expert sources, and therefore be permitted.

So for example, a list could be:

'''Group A'''

URL to Group A
*Person1 & URL to profile page
*Person2 & URL to profile page

'''Group B'''

URL to Group B
*Person3 & URL to profile page
*Person4 & URL to profile page

'''Group C'''

URL to Group C
*Person5 & URL to profile page
*Person6 & URL to profile page

The list needs to be dynamic, with some sort of name submission system if reliable people create their first accounts, or if a person becomes reliable after getting promoted and gaining access to information.

{{rfcquote|text=
This Talk page of [[Qaboos bin Said al Said]] has been rife over a long period of time with discussion of whether claims about the sultan's sexuality should be covered in the article. Numerous people have chimed in, and there is a history of deletions and reversions of those deletions from the article. To summarize the key points made by both sides:
* That the claims exist is documented in several cited sources, and one can probably understand why the sultan's actual sexuality, if not heterosexual, would be significant given the culture of Oman.
* On the other hand, these sources aren't documenting the sultan's sexuality, they're documenting the existence of rumors ''about'' it, and the article doesn't provide context that would make coverage of these rumors relevant. Also, the sources aren't acceptable.

One editor posted the issue to [[WP:BLP]] on June 12, now archived at [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard/Archive255#sultan qaboos al said]]. Discussion there occurred over only a single day, and then one editor unilaterally concluded that he was going to remove the material from the article. There have been three more reversions since then, and now yet another thread has opened, immediately above, on this Talk page. I figured an RFC was in order.

{{rfcquote|text=
* '''Question''': Can [http://www.doctorwhonews.net/ Doctor Who News] be used as a [[WP:RS|reliable source]]?
* '''Previous discussion''': {{slink|Talk:Doctor Who (series 10)‎|‎Draft article for Christmas special}}, involving myself, {{u|Microbat98}}, and {{u|Drmargi}}.
* '''Elaboration''':
: Two weeks ago, Doctor Who News reported that the title of the upcoming 2017 Christmas Special of ''Doctor Who'' was "The Doctors". ([http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2017/07/doctor-who-at-san-diego-comic-con.html Source]: {{tq|the panel will give fans an exclusive sneak peek of The Doctors – the final special starring Peter Capaldi as the Doctor}}.) A discussion was started at the given link as to whether this could be considered reliable and official. Earlier today, an official announcement was given at the 2017 San-Diego Comic Con that the title would be "Twice Upon a Time". ([http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-07-23/the-2017-doctor-who-christmas-special-will-be-called Source]: {{tq|The title for this year's Doctor Who Christmas special has been revealed as Twice Upon a Time}}.)
: The former of the pinged editors above stated in the linked discussion that {{tq|Doctor Who News is a fan website}} and {{tq|DWN isn't official or reliable and probably just created their own working title for it}}. I supported the use of the website as a reliable source, stating {{tq|Doctor Who News has always been considered as a reliable source for Wikipedia when it comes to Doctor Who media; irrelevant if it is "official" or not}}.
: The reason for the question posed in this RFC is that Doctor Who News is currently used to support the viewer ratings for every aired episode of the series. This can be seen at the [[List of Doctor Who serials]] article, where in the header cell containing "UK viewers (millions)" in every season table, [http://guide.doctorwhonews.net/info.php?detail=ratings&type=date this] page is used. I stated this in the previous discussion: {{tq|it's being used as a source for the ratings and AIs of all 839 episodes}}. This can also be seen at individual episode articles; for example, at {{slink|The Pilot (Doctor Who)|Broadcast and reception}}. ([http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2017/04/the-pilot-official-ratings.html Source])
: As can be seen at [[Draft:Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)]], after the official title was announced, I added the information that the episode's title had previously been reported as "The Doctors" back into the article as production information ([[Special:Diff/792042134|diff]]), which the other editor then removed with the same reasoning as they gave in the previous discussion. ([[Special:Diff/792045366|diff]]).
: There does not seem to have been any other editor who has raised concern on whether the website can be used as a reliable source. So, can Doctor Who News be used as a reliable source? Based on my position in this, I clearly '''Support''' that it can. -- '''[[User:AlexTheWhovian|<span style="color:#1632E0;text-shadow:1px 1px 8px #324A6E;">Alex</span>]]'''''[[User talk:AlexTheWhovian#top|<sup><span style="color:#1632E0">TW</span></sup>]]'' 08:19, 24 July 2017 (UTC)}}

One major purpose of this RfC is to address the dearth of DR venues for conduct disputes. The only two venues as of now are [[WP:ANI|ANI]] and [[WP:ARBCOM|ArbCom]]. Both of these venues are exceptionally confrontational, and often directly result in sanctions. Therefore, it is proposed that an Interpretation Committee (IC) be formed. 

# The IC would comprise seven (7) members. To prevent conflicts of interest, no member of the IC could simultaneously serve on ArbCom, or on any other policy-established committee.
# The IC members would be elected on an annual basis by a simple [[approval vote]]. The top seven finishers would become members of the IC. If there are fewer than seven candidates, any unfilled seats would remain vacant until the next election.
# Editors could bring disputes of any sort—content or conduct—before the IC. As with ArbCom, at least some prior discussion between the parties would be required, and IC would be entitled to accept or decline a case. 
# If it agreed to consider a case, the IC would determine the merits of each party's argument, in light of the applicable Wikipedia policies and guidelines. When deciding the case, it would also issue directives as to what the parties must do in order to comply with said policies and guidelines. 
#The IC's directives would have binding force. However, the IC would not have the power to impose sanctions on the parties. In all cases, the IC would initially [[WP:AGF|assume]] that its directives will be complied with. This would be the unique and distinguishing feature of the IC—it would have a purely declaratory function. It would address the core substance of the issue, instead of just sanctioning individuals. It would thus be less confrontational. Sanctions could be imposed ''only if'' a party violated the IC's directive ''after the fact''. Alleged violations would be referred to [[WP:ANI|Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents]] for examination and possible sanction.
#Where necessary, the IC would clarify the meaning of ambiguous policies and guidelines. These interpretations would not merely serve an ''ad hoc'' function, but would be authoritative precedent.
#Decisions of the IC could be appealed to ArbCom. However, the appealing party would have to explain, using policies and guidelines, the errors in the IC's determination. And of course, ArbCom could always decline an appeal at its own discretion.

'''Support D'''

# '''Support'''. Editors need a way to resolve the underlying, substantive issues in disputes, without always having to fear sanctions just for seeking clarification. [[User_talk:Biblioworm|Biblio]] ([[User_talk:Biblioworm#top|talk]])  15:44, 23 July 2017 (UTC)}}

Should a section on fighter effectiveness be included?

:'''Fighter effectiveness'''

Should this article be limited to the single instance of Donald Trump disclosing information to Russia? Or should it be expanded to include other instances of information disclosure by Trump and his administration, and the title modified accordingly?

This article is primarily about a single incident on May 10, where Donald Trump disclosed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and Russian ambassador. There were two other disclosure incidents which are currently mentioned in the article but not expanded on: a disclosure by Trump on April 29 of classified Navy information, and a May 24 disclosure to the press by an anonymous Trump administration source of not-yet-released intelligence about the Manchester Arena bombing. I favor adding more information about those two incidents and changing the article title to the more inclusive title [[Trump administration disclosure of classified information]]. I thought consensus had been reached to do that and I made the move. Another editor disagreed and moved it back to the current title.

Is the statement in the introduction of this article: 'Often considered the best player in the world and regarded by some as the greatest of all time' appropriate for C. Ronaldo?

Like I pointed out: you can find a 'source' for pretty much every claim, but making a statement like this in the introduction of an article gives it the impression as if it's the majority view and an obvious fact. I gave the - rather cynical - example of the painter [[Bob Ross]]. What if you can find someone who thinks Bob Ross is the greatest painter of all time, is that enough to make a statement like: ''some consider him to be the greatest painter of all time''? This seems absurd to me, but it is the logical consequence if it's possible to say 'C. Ronaldo is the greatest of all time' when only one or two writers are claiming this. 

So when is it possible to make statements like 'regarded as the greatest of all time' or 'regarded by some to be the greatest'? When are the sources sufficient? [[User:Max Eisenhardt|Max Eisenhardt]] ([[User talk:Max Eisenhardt|talk]]) 23:14, 29 June 2017 (UTC)}}

So as many people are aware, InternetArchiveBot has been a major help to combating link rot in that it continuously and actively attempts to add archives to any URL that it sees as dead, or is tagged as dead.  This really makes sure all of our sources continue to remain accessible and helps with [[WP:V|verifiability]].  However there are those moments, when archives were not created in time and as such are unavailable when the original URL goes down.  Having the bot add archives not only allows us users to make sure that it has an archive in case of possible link rot, but for those URLs missing an archive, allows us to take the opportunity to archive them elsewhere before possible link rot and add them, thus also letting IABot know that an archive exists, or vice versa.

So how would this work?  Quite simple.  Most sources use the CS1 and/or CS2 citation templates, which has the "deadurl" parameter.  When set to "no", archive URLs are not made clickable on the rendered page, but when set to "yes" or when the parameter is omitted entirely, it will make the title link to the archive version instead.  This allows users that detect dead urls to only have to flip the switch to enable the archived version.  The bot will set deadurl=no to all cite templates it adds archives to that are still working, and of course it will set deadurl=yes to the dead ones as it does now.  The side effect of this is, the non-cite template references that use external links will have {{tlx|Webarchive}} attached to them if it can't convert the link to a cite template.

Hello all,

I want to propose the expansion of A7 to films and television shows.  I am aware that similar proposals have been mooted before however I think that I can do a good job of explaining why we need another discussion.  Recently, I have noticed a sharp increase in the number of articles about films that have come up in the [[Special:NewPagesFeed|new pages feed]].  A large proportion of these simply make no credible claim of significance and are always deleted when PROD-ed.  I have attempted to use this rationale for speedy deletions but the administrators who patrol the A7 categories, quite rightly, follow the policy and either decline it or PROD it themselves.

Web content such as podcasts and live-streamed shows can be deleted under A7 and television shows and films are, for all intents and purposes, the same as "web content" which ''is'' within A7's scope.  I see no reason why, for instance, a drama which makes no credible claim of significance should be exempt from A7 when it is broadcast on terrestrial television but can be tagged for A7 if it is streamed online.  Ergo, sticking something in the 7-day PROD queue which would be deleted via A7 if it had been broadcast in a different manner makes no sense to me.

<s>Due to the nature of deletions (CSD and PROD), I cannot provide diffs or examples but the administrators among you will be able to view deleted pages.</s>  I have provided 20 examples of uncontested AfDs on films and television shows from the past month below.

Therefore I propose that the wording of A7 should be updated to include films and television shows, with the first sentence reading {{tq|This applies to any article about a real person, individual animal(s), organization, web content, film, television show or organized event that does not indicate why its subject is important or significant, with the exception of educational institutions.}}

Thanks,

There is a clear disagreement on the proper use of the draftspace. For example, one edtior in the just above section wrote "a draft must be developed or face deletion". This is a very clear indication that, in his view, there exists a deadline of sort on the pages in the draftspace; the user is not alone in thinking that way (develop or die!). My understanding is that the draftspace was created to host drafts that are previously hosted in the user pages; so to improve discoverability or avoid duplicate efforts. This meant no deadline for example. Anyway, I just wonder what the other editors think and I want it to be on the record that the claim like "a draft must be developed or face deletion" is as fake as (put your favorite example). -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 21:10, 29 July 2017 (UTC)}}

== RfC: on the proper use of the draftspace '''

There does exist a need for some broad discussion about the proper use of the draftspace, as opposed to having local fights in MfDs and such. As I wrote above, the draftspace was created to hold draft pages that were previously kept in the user pages. The idea was this would reduce, for example, the duplicate efforts or allow a new editor to pick up when old drafts are left abandoned. This is why imposing a deadline or deleting abandoned drafts does not make sense. It is important to codify this fact somehow. (Moving the draft pages to the user pages also make no sense for the same reason.) The RfC is the best method for that. Can we just cool down and have actual discussion? (Obviously having discussion should not be opposed for the sake of opposition.) -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 03:31, 31 July 2017 (UTC)}}

There does exist a need for some broad discussion about the proper use of the draftspace, as opposed to having local fights in MfDs and such. As I wrote above, the draftspace was created to hold draft pages that were previously kept in the user pages. The idea was this would reduce, for example, the duplicate efforts or allow a new editor to pick up when old drafts are left abandoned. This is why imposing a deadline or deleting abandoned drafts does not make sense. It is important to codify this fact somehow. (Moving the draft pages to the user pages also make no sense for the same reason.) The RfC is the best method for that. Can we just cool down and have actual discussion? (Obviously having discussion should not be opposed for the sake of opposition.) -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 03:31, 31 July 2017 (UTC)}}

Hello all,

I want to propose the expansion of A7 to films and television shows.  I am aware that similar proposals have been mooted before however I think that I can do a good job of explaining why we need another discussion.  Recently, I have noticed a sharp increase in the number of articles about films that have come up in the [[Special:NewPagesFeed|new pages feed]].  A large proportion of these simply make no credible claim of significance and are always deleted when PROD-ed.  I have attempted to use this rationale for speedy deletions but the administrators who patrol the A7 categories, quite rightly, follow the policy and either decline it or PROD it themselves.

Web content such as podcasts and live-streamed shows can be deleted under A7 and television shows and films are, for all intents and purposes, the same as "web content" which ''is'' within A7's scope.  I see no reason why, for instance, a drama which makes no credible claim of significance should be exempt from A7 when it is broadcast on terrestrial television but can be tagged for A7 if it is streamed online.  Ergo, sticking something in the 7-day PROD queue which would be deleted via A7 if it had been broadcast in a different manner makes no sense to me.

<s>Due to the nature of deletions (CSD and PROD), I cannot provide diffs or examples but the administrators among you will be able to view deleted pages.</s>  I have provided 20 examples of uncontested AfDs on films and television shows from the past month below.

Therefore I propose that the wording of A7 should be updated to include films and television shows, with the first sentence reading {{tq|This applies to any article about a real person, individual animal(s), organization, web content, film, television show or organized event that does not indicate why its subject is important or significant, with the exception of educational institutions.}}

Thanks,

According to [[WP:FILMLEAD]], which is found within [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Film]]:
<blockquote>If the film's nationality is singularly defined by reliable sources (e.g., being called an American film), it should be identified in the opening sentence. If the nationality is not singular, cover the different national interests later in the lead section.</blockquote>
I propose that two nationalities should be allowed in the opening sentence. Just for reference as to how this has been in practice in numerous film articles, please see ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' ("British-American"; also listed as a GA-class article), ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]'' ("Japanese-American"), ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' ("Italian-American"), ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' ("British-American"), ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' ("British-American"), ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' ("American-German"), and ''[[Elle (film)|Elle]]'' ("French-German"). Now, of course, the fact that this has been done on such articles is not a clear reason to allow it, and I have seen several articles on internationally produced films that forego listing the countries in the lede. The above examples are to demonstrate the appearance of listing two countries in the opening sentence.

Adding two countries to an opening sentence does not make significant clutter. Now, when one goes over that limit, I find that it can indeed look cluttered. Take for example ''[[Hector and the Search for Happiness (film)|Hector and the Search for Happiness]]'', which is written as a "German-British-Canadian" film, or ''[[Night of the Sharks]]'', which is referred to as "Italian-Spanish-Mexican". This makes for unnecessary clutter, but I believe that having a maximum of two countries, rather than one or three+, gets the job done quite nicely.

This proposal first came to my mind when editing the article ''[[Baby Driver]]''. The film is a British-American co-production, and there have been [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baby_Driver&diff=prev&oldid=788726513 back-and-forth edits] which either list it as British-American in the opening sentence, or starting the first sentence of the second lede paragraph with "An American-British co-production,...", which falls in line with the current Manual of Style for Film articles. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baby_Driver&diff=prev&oldid=788819402 This] is how the article looks at the time I'm writing this proposal, wherein I edited the page to have "British-American" in the opening sentence, which I assumed was acceptable, as articles like ''Alien'' had done so for months, and possibly years of being in the mainspace.

So, long story short, I don't think there's anything wrong with listing two countries in a film article's opening sentence, and propose that a maximum of two nationalities in such opening sentences be officially allowed. If anyone has reasons against allowing such a thing, I'm open to hearing such concerns, but the only thing I can think of is the clutter that amounts from having three or more nationalities in the opening sentence, and I find that a maximum of two nationalities caps it off quite nicely without looking messy. It's straightforward and removes the obligation of having to include nationalities later on in a film's article's lede. –'''''[[User:MatthewHoobin|<span style="color:#0640e0; text-shadow:#66ff66 0.2em 0.2em 0.4em;">Matthew]]</span>''''' - <span style="font-size:80%">([[User_talk:MatthewHoobin|talk]])</span> 19:17, 3 July 2017 (UTC)}}

* The Willie Nelson song and the Thin Lizzy song both contain a repeated lyric that's a variation of "The night life/ Ain't no good life/ But it's my life".
* Other than that, the lyrics are different.
* The chords and melody of the two songs may have similarities as well, depending on whom you ask - you can hear them both on YouTube, if you're curious; the Willie Nelson song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vk_3kZ1EQI here] and Thin Lizzy song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEf2fB6mXbs here].
* Despite the potential similarities, there appears to be only one clearly reliable source that mentions the two songs together: this [http://www.rollingstone.com/country/lists/willie-nelson-20-essential-songs-w476467/night-life-1965-w476496 ''Rolling Stone'' blurb] about Willie Nelson's "Night Life", which begins, "It's no coincidence that guitar heroes like B.B. King and Thin Lizzy have taken their own stabs at "Night Life." ".
* For the record, B.B. King directly covered Nelson's "Night Life" throughout his career. [[User:Korny O&#39;Near|Korny O&#39;Near]] ([[User talk:Korny O&#39;Near|talk]]) 20:28, 6 July 2017 (UTC)}}

Multiple [[WP:RS]] call Donald Trump a Liar.

The article already states that many of his public statements during the campaign were controversial or false

1. Should the article assume intent and call statements lies, where justified and sourced by WP:RS?
2. Should the article follow [[WP:RS]]es, assume that Trump has an intent to deceive, and refer to him as a liar?

For Reference: per https://www.merriam-webster.com/

'''Liar''':  a person who tells lies has a reputation as a liar

'''Lie:''' to make an untrue statement with intent to deceive

I was browsing wildfire articles and I noticed that many of them had no lasting impact and only had coverage from when the wildfire was happening.

Below is a list of criteria to consider. If a fire does not meet any of the below criteria is highly unlikely to be notable." My problems with this is that WikiProjects can't override guidelines and policies, the WikiProject only has 13 members, and I hate typos on an important page (nitpicking on this one, but seriously).

There has been a huge dispute going on here about whether this is still the same club, following the bankruptcy of its old firm last year. It was  re-established prior to the bankruptcy by the merging of two other clubs, with the re-established entity striving to assume the history and legacy of CSKA Sofia. Some fans say it is still the same club, others that it isn't, and some even say another club is the "real" one, but the main thing is those are all opinions by fans i.e. impossible to reach any consensus with each other. An outside opinion is not only needed, it is the only way to pass the deadlock here. The current title of the article is '''PFC CSKA Sofia‎''' and little of the club's subsequent history (post-bankruptcy) is included in it. Including UEFA's refusal to [http://bfunion.bg/uploads/CSKA-SOFIA_UEFA.pdf allow it into the Europa League]. I am not sure what the policy towards such cases should be (as I have not witnessed any case like it), but any editor with experience with association football could help us here.

Editors commonly complain about the [[Wikipedia:Administrators noticeboard/Incidents|incidents section]] of the [[WP:AN|administrators' noticeboard]]. It is popularly perceived as a drama center, as a pile-on [[kangaroo court]], as chaotic and disorderly, and as a place where vicious personal attacks can be made with impunity. This can be easily confirmed by just looking at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&hidelinks=1&hidetrans=1 the plethora of redirects] to ANI: it is derisively referred to with the terms "[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:CESSPIT&redirect=no cesspit]," "[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Drama_board&redirect=no drama board]," "[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:PITCHFORKS&redirect=no pitchforks]," "[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:HAPPYPLACE&redirect=no happyplace]," "[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Great_Dismal_Swamp&redirect=no Great Dismal Swamp]," "[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:AIRINGOFGRIEVANCES&redirect=no airing of grievances]," "[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:POPCORN&redirect=no popcorn]," "[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Slough_of_Despond&redirect=no Slough of Despond]," "[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Zppix/enwikihell&redirect=no wikihell]," and "[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Complaints_Department&redirect=no Complaints Department]."

ANI does serve a necessary function, but the vast majority of editors would probably agree, in principle, that ANI has some issues. However, there has never been any substantive effort to address those issues. This RfC is intended to change that. 

Be aware that this RfC is mostly '''conceptual'''. The proposals in this RfC are, by design, generally phrased; the object is to get an overall consensus for broad ideas, so as to avoid arguments over petty details. Except for Proposal C, the proposals cannot be implemented immediately, as such. If a proposal passes, further discussions will be held to hammer out the details. 18:00, 5 August 2017 (UTC)}}

Since Nixon was more than President of the United States -- he is also noted for serving in the House, Senate, and as Vice President, I propose that the first sentence be divided into two and generalised to read:

"Richard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) was an American politician. Nixon served as the 37th President of the United States from 1969 until 1974, when he resigned from office, the only U.S. president to do so."

This would be somewhat more consistent with many of the other articles on American presidents, such as [[Lyndon_B._Johnson|this]] and [[Gerald_Ford|this]]. Thanks, [[User:Nechemia Iron|Nechemia Iron]] ([[User talk:Nechemia Iron|talk]]) 13:37, 12 August 2017 (UTC)}}

Not sure if I am opening the [[pandora's box]], but should the [[Film_censorship_in_China#List_of_edited_films|List of Edited Films]] contain two runtime columns as seen here at https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Film_censorship_in_China&oldid=785341359 to provide a quantitative approach to document film censorship? The history of the debate can be seen in the [[Talk:Film_censorship_in_China#Runtime_columns|Runtime column sections]] above. Basically, my opponent(s) from above and at DRN (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution_noticeboard#Talk:Film_censorship_in_China.23Runtime_columns) says no changes: no runtime columns, additions to "List of edited films" firmly supported by secondary sources, and any significant runtime differences noted in the existing notes column with contextualization and sourcing. Whereas, I agree mostly except for the addition of the columns, since we don't have enough textual analysis to provide further contextualization due to primarily budget cuts to the main journalism industry. At least 50+ films can't make it to the list because we can't find secondary sources other than [[Douban]]. Victims include [[The Mummy (2017 film)]], [[The November Man]], [[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (film)]], [[London Has Fallen]], etc. It's illegal now to watch any movie whose runtime is longer than the one approved by censor. Basically by supporting me, you support making this page the last sanctuary and historian of censored films. [[User:Supermann|Supermann]] ([[User talk:Supermann|talk]]) 17:54, 29 July 2017 (UTC)}}

Per [[WP:COATRACK]], the big section here about MIT-SAFE and its history should be [[WP:SPLIT|split]] to another article, [[MIT-SAFE]], leaving behind just the small part that's relevant to the actual topic of this article.  While it will make the current article more of a [[WP:STUB|stub]], that's okay.  A lot of material can be written about the topic, and probably would be (with material actually pertinent) if this were made a stub with a proper focus.

The MIT-SAFE material needs more independent sources, but the organization is probably [[WP:Notability|notable]], even if 2017 Google hits aren't very helpful; it will probably require sourcing from era material like ''Wired'' magazine back issues, etc.  One of its founders had an article here for a while, but it was deleted as a bio at [[WP:AFD|AfD]], because the individual was determined – just barely – personally non-notable (and also strenuously objected to the personalized attention that he thought should be focused on the organization).

I have a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] (former EFF employee), so am not just editing the page to do the split.  Doing this as an [[WP:RFC|RfC]], because this page probably has few active watch-listers; a regular discussion thread would likely garner little response.<br /><span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 22:53, 14 July 2017 (UTC)}}

Some time in the next month or so, the Wikimedia Foundation will be implementing [[WP:ACTRIAL]] at the request of the English Wikipedia community. (See [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Proposal to require autoconfirmed status in order to create articles|the RfC]].) During this trial, new (non-autoconfirmed) users will not be able to create new pages in the main (article) namespace. There is concern this could interfere with legitimate new article creation during edit-a-thons and similar events. In order to address this issue, I would like to propose that we modify the [[Wikipedia:Account creator|Account Creator]] user group (which is commonly assigned temporarily to people running edit-a-thons) so that users in this group can add other users to the [[WP:CONFIRM|Confirmed user group]], thereby allowing vetted users to create new articles at these events. (Note that these articles will still be added to the reviewing queue at [[Special:NewPagesFeed]].) The purpose of this change is basically to provide a work-around during ACTRIAL, so that disruption to these events can be minimized during the trial. As such, it can either be a temporary or permanent change, depending on what the community prefers. [[User:Kaldari|Kaldari]] ([[User talk:Kaldari|talk]]) 21:23, 4 August 2017 (UTC)}}

Note [[Wikipedia talk:Miscellany for deletion#Blatant disregard for the RfC, encouragement of that disregard, and overwhelming of MfD by worthless harmless drafts]], and for example [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Draft:Montenegro-United Kingdom relations]].  Legacypac is proving that there is near endless crap and mess abandoned in DraftSpace.  Unowned (no user caring for it), content-forked attribution-compliance-menacing scrambled mess.  There are few OK stubby things amongst them.  The stuff should be deleted for some many reasons, and page-by-page MfDing them is unworkable and trying is disrupting MfD.

Things in draftspace that are not drafts should be removed to elsewhere.  Users' notes should be moved to userspace.  Article sandboxes deleted per the same rationale written at [[WP:UP#COPIES]], there are good short term but long term they are attribution hazards.  Generally useful stuff, but not article drafting, move to ProjectSpace, and the few long term good drafts, probably a WikiProject in the several instances where this applies.

There are other ideas for this old crap.  DraftPROD.  DraftPROD will be pseudo-speedy deletion.  AfC-managed autodeletion.  Yes, AfC reviewers need to be able to delete completely hopeless things and tendentiously resubmitted stuff, but they do not go backwards for years old abandoned crap.  

Everything in DraftSpace untouched for 6 months should be speediable under G13.  Everything that would be hit by that and shouldn't be deleted should not be in DraftSpace.  Bot edits and minor edits, and tagging "worthless" should not necessarily delay G13, but it really doesn't matter.  --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] ([[User talk:SmokeyJoe|talk]]) 04:37, 25 July 2017 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
This is an extension of the failed proposal of a new criteria made some months ago at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion/Archive_61#Proposed_new_criterion here].
Prose : '''G14: Articles created in violation of the Wikimedia Foundation [[WP:TOU|terms of use]] that prohibit undisclosed paid editing'''
# The main difference this time is in the specifics :<s> This applies only to articles created by users blocked for paid editing or for being confirmed sockpuppets.</s>'''''This applies only to articles created by users blocked for paid editing or for being confirmed sockpuppets, and have no substantial edits by others.'''''
# '''Optional Specific''' : ''The articles must fall into either of the two categories - [[WP:BLP]] or [[WP:ORG]]. ''

Why this helps?
* Most paid editors are experienced folks, and they know how to write articles which rise above deletion. Most often they operate different accounts at the same time, which are not easily linked back to the original sockmasters due to their experience with SPI. So G5 is powerless as the articles were created before they were blocked.
* However I feel there should not be a difference between articles created ''before they were blocked'' and those created ''after they were blocked''. Why :
:# If they were blocked for paid editing, it is self explanatory as to why they should be deleted.
:# If they were blocked for being a '''confirmed''' sockpuppet, they mostly likely had a [[WP:COI]] in creating the articles. The emphasis on confirmed is to avoid any qualms of arbitrariness. For example in - [[WP:Sockpuppet investigations/Amitabhaitc/Archive]], the administrators blocked {{noping|KuwarOnline}} on the suspicion of being a sockpuppet, even without CU evidence to confirm that. So that would mean all the articles created by him would not be eligible for deletion under this criteria, but those by the other confirmed sockpuppets would be eligible for deletion. '''What this does is rule out deleting contributions by all the editors who were blocked as sockpuppets exclusively based on behavioural evidence'''.
* Most often Wikipedia is part of the package for online promotion, per [https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/296187 this]. So paid press often accompanies these articles, and are used as references. [[Voonik]] and its CEO [[Sujayath Ali]] were created by a large sockfarm, and many of its subsequent editors have also been blocked. However they will probably survive AfD, as there are references to satisfy [[WP:CORPDEPTH]] and [[WP:GNG]], and the article will continue to remain, with probably just a COI tag. Well meaning inclusionists will oppose moves to delete this citing the references, scuttling any efforts to delete this. 
* If the articles are deleted as soon as sockpuppets are identified, then it would break the back of paid editors, as customers will not be willing to pay for articles that are deleted soon. I also believe this would lead to more voluntary declarations of [[WP:PAID]] as they would try their best to stay away from being blocked. Suspected paid editors are always keenly watched by Sockpuppet hunters, as the paid editors know, and the fear of loosing all their work, and thereby their reputation among customers would invite more [[WP:PAID]] declarations.
* [[WP:BLP]] and [[WP:ORG]] is good for a start, as these are the most abused areas.
* As with all CSD, the reviewing administrator would still have discretionary powers to look at the suitability. So for example, our current AfD position is to let articles that satisfy [[WP:NPOL]] or [[WP:NFOOTY]] stay. However we do not extend the same for [[WP:NFILM]] and expect them to satisfy [[WP:GNG]]. Same goes with the CSD. If they are sure to survive AfD based on such provisions, they should not be deleted. However in all other cases they should be deleted.

The idea of six principal calendars is supported by the [http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php U.S. Naval Observatory] which states "There are [http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf six principal] calendars in current use. These are the Gregorian, Jewish, Islamic, Indian, Chinese, and Julian Calendars." [Hyperlink in original.]

It has been common to look to astronomy for information about calendars, and in particular, agencies responsible for the publication of nautical almanacs, because these have long been used by sea captains to inform themselves about what they will encounter in worldwide travel. I suggest the U.S. Naval Observatory, and the publication they cite, the ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'' (3rd ed.) are more authoritative on this matter than a dictionary.

==Israel listed as supporting the opposition'''

[https://www.alternet.org/grayzone-project/free-syrian-army-unit-uncovered-rebels-israeli-connection-and-switched-sides#.WYs-wm7xJGk.twitter This article] is used to support Israel as supporting the opposition. I have looked around, and I cannot see any other outlets reporting or corroborating any of this, but the writer of the article [seems somewhat credible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rania_Khalek). However, I see an extraordinary claim here without much evidence provided in the article, so on one hand leaning towards removing it until this is confirmed by more sources. On the other hand, Alternet's credibility as a source doesn't seem to be challenged and the writer seems well-established, so what do you guys think?

The end date of the Battle of Mosul is being disputed. Two editors ([[User:MonsterHunter32]], [[User:JoetheMoe25]]) state the battle ended on July 10th, when victory was declared by the Iraqi government and supported by CENTCOM. Four editors ([[User:LightandDark2000]], [[User:StuRat]], [[User:XavierGreen]] and me) consider the battle to have continued until at least July 20th since numerous sources stated that despite the Iraqi government's declaration of victory heavy air-strikes, shelling and fighting continued in the Old City of Mosul (a few sources saying outright the battle itself was not over). The Iraqi government and CENTCOM are calling it ''clearing operations'' and MonsterHunter32 and User:JoetheMoe25 do not consider it part of the battle. LightandDark2000, StuRat, XavierGreen and me do consider it part of the battle. I made two compromise proposals. One that the battle's end date be set as ''10/20 July 2017'', with a note (rejected). Second that we present two dates in the infobox, one ''16 October 2016 – 10 July 2017'' saying in brackets ''main phase of the battle'', the other ''July 11–20, 2017'' saying in brackets ''clearing operations'' (again rejected). I leave it to un-involved editors now to state their opinion and possibly help us find a compromise solution to the dispute.

[[Template:High-use]] and [[Template:High-risk]] are templates which are meant to be added to the documentation pages of templates which are transcluded on more than 2,500 ([[Template:High-use]]) or more than 100,000 ([[Template:High-risk]]) pages. They notify people viewing these templates that changes to them are risky since they are transcluded on so many pages. But, many templates that need the high-use or high-risk templates still don't have them. For example, many of the templates in the lower ranks of [[Wikipedia:Database reports/Templates transcluded on the most pages|the top 3000 most transcluded templates]] don't have the high-use template, even though most of them are transcluded on 5,000-6,000 pages. To solve this problem, I propose a bot that would look through the templates in [[:Category:Wikipedia templates]] and see how many transclusions they have. If one had more than 2,500 and less than 100,000 transclusions, the high-use template would be added to its documentation page. However, if it had more than 100,000 transclusions, the high-risk template would be added to its documentation page.

I made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neal_D._Barnard&diff=796379093&oldid=787017603 this] edit which consisted of mostly cosmetic improvements - in the infobox, I capitalized the first letter of the occupation, I added the birth and date template to the existing date of birth and put the date of birth from the infobox to the body of the article, I moved the individual's place of work to the title section, as suggested in the guidelines, I created the sections Bibliography and Filmography as per the MOS to give more visibility to some of the works that were already in the article, I removed the link to the doctor's website because it was a redirect.

I also added some new information that I believed was not questionable at all - the city of birth which could be found at the organization's website, two more films he's been in, some of the books he's written, and the fact that the person was vegan (I saw a video where he said that but I wasn't sure if it would be a great source, so I didn't back it up and instead added the article to my watch list, so that I would find a better source if anyone questions it, which I did eventually).

Minutes after that, the edit was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neal_D._Barnard&diff=796380583&oldid=796379093 fully reverted] by {{User|Alexbrn}}. As [[WP:ROWN]] reasonably says, this can be disruptive because it does nothing to improve the article. Instead of removing or asking for references for the things that were questionable, all of the cosmetic changes were removed as well.

Switching to the module allows for better parsing of output, more flexibility with input, easier updating as databases are added and removed, and cleaner integration with WikiData.

There are some differences in the output:
* The "Taxon identifiers" link points to [[Help:Taxon identifiers]] (currently a draft) instead of [[:Wikidata:Wikidata:WikiProject_Taxonomy]]
* Links are presented in alphabetical order
* More sources are supported from Wikidata, based on the list of sources included in [[:gl:Módulo:Taxonbar]], and Wikidata itself is used as a source
* The module hides itself if no sources other than Wikidata are found.

The module itself is located at [[Module:Taxonbar]], but all configuration of supported databases is at [[Module:Taxonbar/conf]] for easier updating. A sandboxed version of the module-based template is at [[Template:Taxonbar/sandbox2]], and the testcases page at [[Template:Taxonbar/testcases]] has been updated to show a comparison of the outputs of the current template and the module-based one.

Are there any comments, suggestions, or requests before the working template is switched over to use the module? --[[User:Ahecht|Ahecht]] ([[User_talk:Ahecht|<span style="color:#FFF;background:#00f;display:inline-block;padding:1px 1px 0;vertical-align:-0.3em;line-height:1;font-size:50%;text-align:center;"><b>TALK<br />PAGE</b></span>]]) 20:59, 26 July 2017 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
A month or so ago, it become apparent that changes to the inclusion criteria for this project (which governs around about 16 articles, [[2002]], [[2003]], ... [[2017]]) were subject to more scrutiny because the project guidelines had been advanced to become a fully-fledged Wikipedia guideline.  A quick look at [[:Category:Wikipedia editing guidelines]] shows that this is '''only Wikiproject currently enshrined as a full Wikipedia guideline'''.   The individual editor who promoted the criteria to being a Wikipedia guideline ({{U|Wrad}} has already accepted that his promotion of the project guide to a full-blown Wikipedia guideline was erroneous ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Recent_years&diff=prev&oldid=789171331 here]) and even attempted to remedy that situation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Recent_years&diff=prev&oldid=789170470 here]) only to be reverted by {{U|Beeblebrox}} who quoted a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Recent_years&diff=next&oldid=789170680 recent RFC] which apparently reinforced this view of the guideline being an official Wikpiedia guideline.  Wrad subsequently retired when his attempts to remedy the situation were reverted).

I submit that:
#This project, which covers just 16 pages, is more than entitled to a style guide (like Wikiproject Football, for instance) to define what kind of items do and do no belong here. 
#This guideline be downgraded to an [[WP:ESSAY|essay]], in keeping with all the other style guides and inclusion criteria for Wikiprojects across Wikipedia.
#The current criteria, however flawed, should probably be the default adopted position once this guideline is downgraded. 

In doing so, minor and common sense changes will be able to be made to the essay, without the necessity for admin intervention (e.g. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARecent_years&type=revision&diff=788325540&oldid=787922277 this]) or burdensome community interjection.  And in absolute terms, there is no good reason for this tiny Wikiproject's style guide to be treated with the same gravitas as [[WP:AGF]] or [[WP:BITE]] or [[WP:FORK]] or [[WP:RS]] or [[WP:BOLD]]....

{{rfcquote|text=
Hi all,

I'm proposing a change to the [[WP:PROF|notability guideline for academics]].

I am aware that a ''similar'' proposal was mooted about a year ago, however it was argued merely on the grounds of [[WP:GNG]] compliance whereas I am also arguing the case on consistency with other guidelines.  In other words, don't speedily close it on the grounds that it's already been discussed.

The sidebar on the [[WP:NOTABILITY|notability]] page gives eleven subject-specific notability guidelines, excluding the academic guideline.

These are:
*[[WP:NASTRO]], which specifically states {{tq|These criteria do not supersede WP:NOTABILITY, they merely supplement and clarify it within the context of astronomical objects. If an astronomical object does not meet the general notability guideline, especially if it lacks evidence of significant coverage in independent, reliable sources, then it risks being merged or redirected to an existing article, or deleted altogether.}}
*[[WP:NBOOK]], which specifically states {{tq|This is not an absolute guarantee that there will necessarily be a separate, stand-alone article entirely dedicated to that book.}}
*[[WP:NEVENT]], which specifically states {{tq|Events are probably notable if they have enduring historical significance and meet the general notability guideline, or if they have a significant lasting effect.}}
*[[WP:NFILM]], which specifically states {{tq|For the majority of topics related to film, the criteria established at the general notability guideline is sufficient to follow.}}
*[[WP:NGEO]], which specifically states {{tq|Per Wikipedia's Five pillars, the encyclopedia also functions as a gazetteer; therefore, geographical features meeting Wikipedia's General notability guideline (GNG) are presumed, but not guaranteed, to be notable.}}
*[[WP:NMUS]], which specifically states {{tq|Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; conversely, meeting any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. Rather, these are rules of thumb...}}
*[[WP:NNUMBER]], which doesn't mention the general notability guideline because numbers themselves don't really get coverage in themselves.  Maybe this could be changed but that's a separate issue.
*[[WP:NORG]], which specifically states {{tq|No organization is considered notable except to the extent that independent sources demonstrate that it has been noticed by people outside of the organization.}}  This is almost identical to the provisions laid out at [[WP:GNG]] so it complies with it in everything but name.
*[[WP:NPERSON]], which specifically states {{tq|Failure to meet these criteria is not conclusive proof that a subject should not be included; conversely, meeting one or more does not guarantee that a subject should be included.}}
*[[WP:NSPORT]], which specifically states {{tq|Please note that the failure to meet these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; conversely, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. These are merely rules of thumb...}}
*[[WP:NWEB]], which specifically states {{tq|These criteria are presented as rules of thumb for easily identifying web content that Wikipedia should probably have articles about. In almost all cases, a thorough search for independent, third-party reliable sources will be successful for content meeting one or both of these criteria. However, meeting these criteria is not an absolute guarantee that Wikipedia should have a separate, stand-alone article entirely dedicated to the content.}}

Please note that all of these guidelines either explicitly state that meeting their provisions and not the [[WP:GNG|general notability guideline]] (or just merely meeting their provisions) does not ''necessarily'' establish notability, or offer deference to the general notability guideline and incorporate it into their criteria.

However, [[WP:PROF]] is the only subject-specific guideline which explicitly states that its provisions supersede the general notability guideline and that the latter is irrelevant when discussing the notability of academics, specifically stating {{tq|If an academic is notable under this guideline, his or her failure to meet either the General Notability Guideline or other subject-specific notability guidelines is irrelevant.}}

The whole idea of a general notability guideline is that it can be applied to everything because it makes the process of establishing notability fair and even across different topics or at least evens the playing field.  While in practice at AfD, stubs on sportspeople who meet [[WP:NSPORT]] but not [[WP:GNG]] are likely to be kept under the former, [[WP:NSPORT]] specifically states that it is merely a {{tq|rule of thumb}} and is merely to be used as an easy method of ''interpreting [[WP:GNG]]: {{tq|The guideline on this page provides bright-line guidance to enable editors to determine quickly if a subject is likely to meet the General Notability Guideline.}}  I see no reason why we should allow academics to receive a free pass over the general notability guideline.  

'''Therefore, I propose that we remove the paragraph from [[WP:PROF]] which reads {{tq|This guideline is independent from the other subject-specific notability guidelines, such as WP:BIO, WP:MUSIC, WP:AUTH etc. and is explicitly listed as an alternative to the General Notability Guideline.[1] It is possible for an academic not to be notable under the provisions of this guideline but to be notable in some other way under one of the other subject-specific notability guidelines. Conversely, if an academic is notable under this guideline, his or her failure to meet either the General Notability Guideline or other subject-specific notability guidelines is irrelevant.}}'''

Thanks,

'''Should "Sir" and "Dame" be treated as pre-nominals or as an integral part of a name?''' Despite repeated debates, no consensus has yet been reached. The most recent MoS talk page discussion may be found here: [[WT:MOS#Using "Sir" as a pre-nominal]]. The OP there pointed out that with no clear policy on this matter, some editors remove the Sir, with others re-adding it later. This can lead to unintentional edit-warring. A pre-nominal is something which is added to the start of someone's name, rather like MBE/OBE may be tacked onto the end. An example is 'Sir Winston Churchill'. NB, this was initially raised due to concerns about Sir/Dame being removed from ''infoboxes''. –[[User:Sb2001|<span style="font-family:Impact;font-size:10.5pt;color:#800080">Sb2001</span>]] [[User talk:Sb2001|<sup><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:8pt;color:#008000">talk page</span></sup>]] 18:47, 23 August 2017 (UTC)}}

Should we change our procedures on adminbot trials to hold them on bot accounts instead of the operator's main account (when it is technically infeasible to trial without admin actions)? ~ [[User:BU Rob13|<b>Rob</b><small><sub>13</sub></small>]]<sup style="margin-left:-1.0ex;">[[User talk:BU Rob13|Talk]]</sup> 23:03, 1 August 2017 (UTC)}}

In a recent [[WP:TH#Periods in College Degrees? (BA) vs. (B.A.)|discussion]] at the [[WP:TH|Teahouse]] there was disagreement as to whether the Bachelor of Arts degree should be listed as "B.A." or "BA" when it follows a name in the lead section of an article, in an infobox, or elsewhere in an article. Relevant MOS sections cited seemed to differ on this point. These were:
* [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Abbreviations#Abbreviations widely used in Wikipedia]] specifically says {{xt|BA (or AB)}} without periods or spaces.
* [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Full_stops_and_spaces]] The MoS indicates that STOPS should be used in American English style articles. 
* [[MOS:POINTS]] says {{tqqi|Modern style is to use a full point (period) after a shortening (although there are many exceptions) but no full point with an acronym}}. 
There was also disagreement as to whether {{xt|BA}} is an acronym for purposes of applying the MOS rule about acronyms. The same rule might or might not apply to PhD vs Ph.D.

The arguments made in the Teahouse discussion can be seen at greater length there, and I rather expect will be more or less repeated here. I am asking that we develop a clear and specific consensus on which form should apply, and whether it depends on [[WP:STRONGNAT|strong national ties]] in a particular article.

I'm proposing a new policy that would also affect the BLP policy. I suggest that there be a policy that forbids articles from describing a living person's political views differently from how the person himself describes them '''in a direct statement'''. In other words, we shouldn't be able to call Donald Trump a liberal even though he clearly isn't one. We shouldn't be able to call Richard Spencer a white supremacist even though he rejects that label. We shouldn't be able to call MLK a black supremacist and so on.
My policy wouldn't necessarily require a person to embrace the label for it to be acceptable, but if the person says "No, that is not what I am" to a certain label, we should be forbidden to call that person that.
I strongly encourage any editors, before opposing the rule, to suggest how to make it better. <span style="color:blue">'''THE DIAZ'''</span> <sup>[[User talk:The Diaz|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/The Diaz|contribs]]</sup> 21:38, 5 August 2017 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
*I am seeking comments on a proposal to color code the [[group 12 element]]s as [[post-transition metal]]s in the Wikipedia [[periodic table]], rather than [[transition metal]]s as they are currently color coded.

:The origin of this proposal can be traced to a 1983 article by Bill Jensen, in the ''Journal of Chemical Education,'' [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed080p952 here], in which he noted that there was "roughly a 50–50 split between those texts that included the Zn group among the transition metals versus those that did not." In the same article he gave supporting arguments for treating group 12 as other than transition metals.

:IUPAC does not take a firm position on this question. They say that groups 3 to 12 are the d-block elements and that these are commonly referred to as transition metals though group 12 is not always included (see [https://www.iupac.org/fileadmin/user_upload/databases/Red_Book_2005.pdf here], p. 51). Certainly, the group 12 elements do not satisfy the IUPAC Gold Book [https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/T/T06456.html definition of a transition metal,] which is "An element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell."

:Most of the chemistry of group 12 is that of main group elements rather than transition metal chemistry. This is due to d-shell being inaccessible in these elements. Physically, there is a related abrupt and significant reduction in metallic character going from group 11 to group 12.

:My impression is that groups 3–12 are treated as transition metals at least in part due to (a) a misguided conflation with the d-block metals: (b) the previous absence of a good name for the group 12–16 metals; and (c) a "tail wagging the dog" phenomenon, wherein a minority of similarities the group 12 metals have with the transition metals is used to leverage the whole group into the same category as the transition metals.

:For example, the transition metal article says:

::[1] "When discussing the crystal field stabilization energy of first-row transition elements, it is convenient to also include the elements calcium and zinc, as both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> have a value of zero against which the value for other transition metal ions may be compared."

:The same article goes on:

::[2] "Another example occurs in the Irving-Williams series of stability constants of complexes."

:The first example strikes me as highly dubious given Ca is effectively never categorised as a transition metal.

:The second example is elaborated in the [[Group 12 element|Group 12 element]] article:

::"…they [group 12] share many characteristics with the neighboring group 11 elements on the periodic table, which are almost universally considered to be transition elements…Zinc complexes merit inclusion in the Irving-Williams series as zinc forms many complexes with the same stoichiometry as complexes of copper(II), albeit with smaller stability constants."

:My response to this is to note that (according to ''Advanced Inorganic Chemistry,'' Cotton et al. 1999, p. 598) zinc forms none of the other typical sorts of transition metals complexes i.e. the similarity is passing rather than substantial.

:The [[Group 12 element|Group 12 article]] goes on to say that, "There is little similarity between cadmium and silver as compounds of silver(II) are rare and those that do exist are very strong oxidizing agents. Likewise the common oxidation state for gold is +3, which precludes there being much common chemistry between mercury and gold, though there are similarities between mercury(I) and gold(I) such as the formation of linear dicyano complexes."

:I don't see anything here that warrants categorising group 12 as transition metals.

:Smith's approach in ''Inorganic Substances: A Prelude to the Study of Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry'' (1990, p. 113) strikes me as wise: "Textbook writers have always found difficulty in dealing with these elements. In this book, they will be placed with either the transition elements or the Main Group elements, as the occasion demands."

:So yes, categorise them as post-transition metals, and feel free to include or make reference to them in the transition metal article or the Irving-William series article, for comparative purposes.

:There was a flurry of excitement a little while back when it seemed that HgF<sub>4</sub> was a real compound and CnF<sub>4</sub> was predicted to be possible (and hence both Hg and Cn could arguably have perhaps been regarded as transition metals, since such compounds would require the involvement of either 5d or 6d electrons), however new experiments have not found any evidence of HgF<sub>4</sub>, and newer calculations also cast serious doubt on the existence of Cn(IV).

:The fact that (a) nearly effectively everyone agrees 3–11 are transition metals; (b) it's about 50-50 when it comes to treating group 12 as transition metals; (c) IUPAC is either no help or contradictory; (d) the chemistry of group 12 is very largely main group chemistry, suggests to me that the default position for categorising transition metals should be 3–11, unless a robust case can be made for 3–12. In my view, there is no such case. As noted, if group 12 were to be categorised as post-transition metals, they can still be referred to, for comparative purposes, in e.g. the transition metal article.

Per [[WP:COATRACK]], the big section here about MIT-SAFE and its history should be [[WP:SPLIT|split]] to another article, [[MIT-SAFE]], leaving behind just the small part that's relevant to the actual topic of this article.  While it will make the current article more of a [[WP:STUB|stub]], that's okay.  A lot of material can be written about the topic, and probably would be (with material actually pertinent) if this were made a stub with a proper focus.

The MIT-SAFE material needs more independent sources, but the organization is probably [[WP:Notability|notable]], even if 2017 Google hits aren't very helpful; it will probably require sourcing from era material like ''Wired'' magazine back issues, etc.  One of its founders had an article here for a while, but it was deleted as a bio at [[WP:AFD|AfD]], because the individual was determined – just barely – personally non-notable (and also strenuously objected to the personalized attention that he thought should be focused on the organization).

I have a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] (former EFF employee), so am not just editing the page to do the split.

The discussion here is two part.  
*1. Whether mention of the Women's Media Social Media Award is appropriate for inclusion and whether the sourcing is proper.  It was initially only sourced to a release of the award ceremony.  However, [[User:Dennis Bratland|Dennis Bratland]] has provided four additional sources mentioned above.  
*2. Second issue is whether the quote:--
:{{bq|''I hear a lot these days about the lazy, aimless 'millennials' – about how all we want to do is sit around twerking our iPods and Tweedling our Kardashians – and I also hear people asking, 'Where is the next generation of the social justice movement? Where are all the young feminists and womanists and activists?' Dude, they're on the internet.''}}
::should be included. I argue its promotional, poorly sourced and soapboxey.  [[User:Dennis Bratland|Dennis Bratland]] argues that it provides valuable information about the subject.

Should the article include the December 1976 [[Jack Anderson]] column in ''[[The Washington Post]]''?

<blockquote>Among the first public attention to the fire safety of Ford automobiles was December 30, 1976 when columnist [[Jack Anderson]] and investigative journalist [[Les Whitten]] writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said that Ford testing had revealed a fire hazard posed by the placement of the fuel tank behind the rear axle in some Ford models, and that "thousands" had died or been disfigured in fires after crashes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Corporate Crime Under Attack: The Fight to Criminalize Business Violence |first1=Francis T. |last1=Cullen |first2=Gray |last2=Cavender |first3=William J. |last3=Maakestad |first4=Michael L. |last4=Benson |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2014 |page=146 |isbn=9781317523666 |quote=Jack Anderson and Les Whitten were perhaps the first to claim that Ford, despite having the technology to do so, had consciously refused to fix the potentially lethal hazard posed by the placement of the Pinto's gas tank. They began their December 30, 1976, column in ''The Washington Post'' by claiming, "Buried in the secret files of the Ford Motor Co. lies evidence that big auto makers have put profits ahead of lives." This "lack of concern," they lamented, "has caused thousands of people to die or be horribly disfigured in fiery crashes." All this, they said, was preventable: "Secret tests by Ford have shown that minor adjustments in the location of the fuel tank could greatly reduce the fiery danger." Moreover, "repositioning of the tank would cost only a few dollars more per car" - not much of a price when human lives are at stake. "In the long run," they warned, "the auto makers are saving little with this 'cost cutting'" Nine months later, these criticisms were elaborated in Mark Dowie's scathing condemnation of Ford, called "Pinto Madness."}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Danley|first1=John R.|title=Polishing up the Pinto: Legal Liability, Moral Blame, and Risk |journal=[[Business Ethics Quarterly]] |date=April 2005|volume=15|issue=2|pages=205-236 |quote= Beyond the legal problems, Ford was taking a public relations beating...Several months before the article, Jack Anderson had written a column claiming that thousands of people were either killed or disfigured as a result of this poorly designed vehicle.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first1=Jack |last1=Anderson |authorlink1=Jack Anderson |first2=Les |last2=Whitten |authorlink2=Les Whitten |date=December 30, 1976 |title=Auto maker shuns safer gas tank |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |quote=Buried in the secret files of the Ford Motor Co. lies evidence that big auto makers have put profits ahead of lives.

The years have been removed from headings with no justification. The justification was that there were overlaps, however, before the years were removed, there weren't any overlaps, all the sections were concise. But now the years have been removed, there are huge overlaps, which is due to the fact that mulitple parts of Grande's career took place around the same time, like her work on Nickelodeon and ''Yours Truly''. Removing the years only works if there is no overlap between parts of an person's career and there have never been multiple projects at once, which is the case with Ariana. The fact that the reasoning given is completely incorrect means that it needs to be discussed, as currently there is no reason for it, not to mention the fact that the change was made without discussion and was only discussed at all due to it being challenged, even then it wasn't really a proper discussion, the editors in favour simply would not provide any reason or evidence as to why the years should be removed, it was just repeated that more editors were in favour than opposition.

I won't revert-war over a {{who}} tag, but instead, I'll turn this into an opportunity to elaborate my questioning of the claim: 
''{{quote|"State atheism is the name given by scholars to the incorporation of positive atheism or non-theism into political regimes"}}''
The term "state atheism" is not present in any mainstream reference I can find, and the 'scholarly reference' that is supposed to be a justification for reverting leads only to a badly-reviewed [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dictionary-Atheism-Oxford-Reference-Online-ebook/product-reviews/B01N539KSD/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_top?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews] not-even-print 'dictionary' (really, a collection of 'atheist terminology', as the book own description says, "neologisms by or about atheists"[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191816819.001.0001/acref-9780191816819]). What's more, the dictionary entry does not at all reflect the claim it is purported to support, as it says only 'is the name given to' without any mention of 'by who' let alone 'scholarly'... adding 'by scholars' to the claim 'because' the publishing house ('Oxford Quick Reference Online'?) is 'scholarly' is seemingly intentionally misleading [[WP:SYNTH]] and [[WP:OR]].

If the term is as common and authorative as the claim tries to suggest, it should be a simple matter to demonstrate it. If not, the claim must be changed to reflect the concept's real origins, or it should be removed altogether, as, as is, it goes against several Wikipedia policies. <span style="font-family:Futura, Helvetica, _sans;font-size:85%;text-shadow:1px 1px 3px #111111;">[[User:ThePromenader|<span style="color:#ddd;">THE<span style="color:#fff;">PROMENADER</span></span>]]&nbsp;<span style="color:#fff;">[[User_talk:ThePromenader|✎]]&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/ThePromenader|✓]]</span></span> 17:18, 2 September 2017 (UTC)}}

Since Wikipedia is (one of) the world's most consulted website-references that 'anyone can edit', that makes it a prime target for anyone seeking to [[WP:SOAPBOX]]-'broadcast' it. I've seen this a ''lot'' in my ~13 years here, but have seen little done to counter it.

And always it's the same behaviour pattern repeating: those [[WP:PUSH]]ing a claim, since reason nor evidence is on their side, will engage in all the worst 'tactics', and drown any discussion in sophist-distraction... often answered point-by-point by well-intended contributors (whose demonstrations of evidence are often just ignored), but the result is always a too-long-to-read mess (and this itself has become a soapbox-er disuasion-confusion-muddle 'tactic'). Admins involved in any conflict this generates tend to balk at this and not dig down through all the distraction to the central issue, resulting in a judgement that actually aids the soapbox-ers, and I've seen this same thing happening time and time again.

Is there any place contributors could go to seek the advice/administration help of those who are familiar with this trend?

[[WP:RAPID]] is perhaps the most antithetical policies on Wikipedia. According to RAPID it is best not to rush to create an article:
:''It is wise to delay writing an article about a breaking news event until the significance of the event is clearer as early coverage may lack perspective and be subject to factual errors. Writing about breaking news may be recentism, and Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. It is recommended that editors start a section about the event within an existing article on a related topic if possible, which may later be split into its own article if the coverage suggests that the event is independently notable.''
However, in the same breadth, it advices us not to rush to delete articles. Writers completely disregard the first section of the policy but regularly apply a rationale at AfD similar to this: "Per RAPID. Let us wait for more reports before deleting the article". When we allow this "logic" to flourish at AfD, we are encouraging editors to disregard the criteria outlined by [[WP:EVENTCRIT]] in favor of their good ol' ace in the hole: "Keep... well because RAPID".
*For that reason I propose we include a disclaimer in RAPID similar to this: ''RAPID cannot be the basis for keeping an article on a current event. A participant at an [[WP:AfD|article deletion discussion]] must apply the criteria for inclusion of an event''.[[User:TheGracefulSlick|TheGracefulSlick]] ([[User talk:TheGracefulSlick|talk]]) 23:30, 7 September 2017 (UTC)}}

(I should probably disclose that [http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/71.208.245.45 I am an occasional contributor at Rational-Wiki myself, but without being registered]) There are numerous policy concerns with a board member of the Rational-Media Foundation adding a link to [[Rational-Wiki]] in this article, including [[WP:ELNO]], [[WP:SPAMMER]], [[WP:PROMOTION]], and since adding the link is more or less validating their viewpoint, [[WP:NPOV]]. Rational-Wiki blatantly fails [[WP:ELNO]] and the matter has been discussed on numerous other articles, as I have explained in the previous section. Some other users have used [[WP:USEFUL]], [[WP:HARMLESS]], and [[WP:VALINFO]] arguments but have not provided any policy-based argument for its inclusion. In my opinion, policy trumps sympathy, and I see no policy-based grounds to include a link to Rational-Wiki in this article.

* RFC Text:

{{rfcquote|text=
George E. P. Box is famous for, among other things, saying that "all models are wrong" and "all models are wrong, but some are useful". Related to that, this article included the following sentence and reference.
<blockquote>Box wrote that "essentially, [[all models are wrong]], but some are useful" in his book on [[response surface methodology]] with Norman&nbsp;R. Draper.[*]
{{refbegin}}[*] Box, George E. P.; Norman R. Draper (1987). ''Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces'', p. 424, Wiley. {{isbn|0-471-81033-9}}. [[q:George Box|(more details at wikiquote)]]{{refend}}
</blockquote>

There is a Wikipedia article about the saying: [[All models are wrong]]. As that article details, Box first published the saying in a 1976 paper in the ''[[Journal of the American Statistical Association]]'', which is the most-prestigious statistical journal. The article [[All models are wrong]] also gives three other publications in which Box published the saying, including "Box's widely cited book ''Statistics for Experimenters''". Additionally, the article contains substantial discussion of the saying, and many references. (It is worthwhile to read the article.)

The above-quoted sentence mentions only the 1987 book with Draper. Ergo, the above-quoted sentence is misleading: because people reading the sentence will believe that the 1987 book is the first/prime/only instance for Box's saying. Clearly, then, the sentence should be revised.

What should the revised sentence be? Recommendations are welcome.

I do not have a strongly-held opinion on what the sentence should be. I lean toward including no references and instead wikilinking to the article [[All models are wrong]], because that article includes all the references and discussion. Hence, I changed the sentence to this: &ldquo;Box famously wrote, in various books and papers, that "[[all models are wrong]], but some are useful".&rdquo;

[[User:DanielPenfield]] has repeatedly reverted the article to include the sentence that cites the 1987 book. I attempted to discuss the issue on his talk page, but we did not seem to communicate adequately—and he repeatedly accused me of vandalism etc. Hence, this Request for Comment.

*Upon examination of its content and sources, most of this article is [[WP:SYNTH]] and [[WP:OR]] (and arguably [[WP:ATTACK]]) content hung on a [[WP:NEOLOGISM]] [[WP:COATRACK]].

Even the only available 'source' (a poorly-reviewed and uncited-by-any-author e-book compiled by religious authors [https://www.stmarys.ac.uk/staff-directory/stephen-bullivant?filtered=1]) defining the term is, by its own description, a collection of "neologisms by or about atheists" [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191816819.001.0001/acref-9780191816819].

In the section above [[#revisiting local edit filter helpers group]] there is local support for creating a new user right called <code>edit filter helper</code> that will allow read only access to private edit filters. That section is also where all the discussion leading up to this RfC took place. The details of the specific rights included, and the associated processes, are at the new information page [[Wikipedia:Edit filter helper]] ([[WP:EFH]]). While this RfC is in progress, please do not make significant changes to that page. 

If this RfC is successful, a request will be made at Phabricator for the right to be created (an RfC or similar display of community support is a prerequiste for this), and once created [[Wikipedia:Edit filter helper]] will be changed from a proposal to an information and process page and updated appropriately.

This is the paragraph at the centre of controversy. 

{{talkquote|Hyderabad violated all clauses of the agreement: in external affairs, by carrying out intrigues with Pakistan, to which it secretly loaned 15 million pounds; in defence, by building up a large semi-private army; in communications, by interfering with the traffic at the borders and the through traffic of Indian railways.{{sfnp|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=480–481}} India was also accused of violating the agreement by imposing an economic blockade. It turned out that the state of [[Bombay State|Bombay]] was interfering with supplies to Hyderabad without the knowledge of Delhi. The Government promised to take up the matter with the provincial governments, but scholar Lucien Benichou states that it was never done. India also delayed arms shipments to Hyderabad from India, which is considered a breach of the standstill agreement.<ref>{{harvp|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=480–481}}; {{harvp|Raghavan, War and Peace in Modern India|2010|p=77}}; {{harvp|Benichou, From Autocracy to Integration|2000|pp=213–215}}</ref>}}
{{reflist-talk}}

The issue here are:

1.Should this sentence (i.e. {{tq|‘Hyderabad violated all clauses of the agreement’)}} be written in Wikipedia voice?

I think keeping the later issues in mind, it shouldn’t. Actual facts described in RS are more nuanced than this. Hyderabad had its own side of the story too (see issue 2). We cannot write the perspective of my Indian countrymen as blanket facts.

2.Whether this clause should be added after the sentence in issue number 1.

{{tq| Hyderabad protested that its loan to Pakistan was a non-political investment<ref>{{harvp|Benichou, From Autocracy to Integration|2000|pp=213}}</ref> and the private army was for the defence of Muslims.<ref>{{harvp|Benichou, From Autocracy to Integration|2000|pp=214}}</ref>}}

I think it should as it explains some of the Hyderabadi perspective about their ‘violations’ of the Standstill agreement. It is cited to a reliable source too.

3.Should {{tq|‘considered a breach of the standstill agreement’}} in the contentious passage be changed to was a {{tq|‘definite breach by India of the Standstill agreement’?}} 

My reason for saying it was a '''definite''' breach is that is how the cited RS describes it. <ref name="Benichou2000">{{cite book|author=Lucien D. Benichou|title=From Autocracy to Integration: Political Developments in Hyderabad State, 1938-1948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Loiq3YrFy40C&pg=PA213|year=2000|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-1847-6|pages=213–}}</ref> {{tq|‘Considered to be’}} appears to be weasel wording, [[WP:EUPHEMISM]].

4.Should India’s support for border raids on Hyderabad, cited to scholar Lucien D. Benichou, be included?

My stance is that it should. My opponent [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AStandstill_agreement_%28India%29&diff=794196251&oldid=794115039 called] Lucien D. Benichou a sloppy source. I disagreed and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AStandstill_agreement_%28India%29&diff=794301645&oldid=794196251 pointed out] the favourable scholarly reviews of Benichou’s book in contrast to other sources used for this article such as Srinath Raghavan. 
My opponent then [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AStandstill_agreement_%28India%29&diff=795339907&oldid=795339339 said] ‘Benichou is not acceptable beecause he provides no evidene’. 

My stance again is that he is a reliable scholar who has studied the Hyderabadi integration into India in detail and has received favourable scholarly reviews.<ref> Peter Lehr (2002) Review of ''From Autocracy to Integration: Political Developments in Hyderabad State (1938-1948)'' by Lucien D.

Why are significant artists of the Dutch Golden Age not represented? You can't add all the painters that were of significance to art history, but considering the representatives of Italian, Spanish and French art, surely the painters from the Dutch Golden Age are far from being adequately represented (only 3 of them are included!). So why is adding [[Jan Steen]] problematic? He's regarded as one of the major painters of the baroque. The same goes for [[Gerard ter Borch]], [[Pieter de Hooch]] and [[Gerrit Dou]]. They were highly important painters, especially for the development of [[genre art]]. Then the exclusion of [[landscape painting]] and [[marine painting]], which got a massive impulse in 17th century Dutch art. Why are painters like [[Jacob van Ruisdael]] or [[Meindert Hobbema]] - who are generally considered to be two of the greatest landscape artists - not included? The same goes for [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]], a major innovator in the genre of [[marine painting]] and a massive influence on [[J. M. W. Turner]]. Considering the painters who are represented in the article (many of whom are not at all 'major' painters), the painters from the Dutch Golden Age are far from being adequately represented.

Most of the details of my concerns are in the section immediately preceding this RfC, but I'll reiterate: 

To my eye, the scanned document certainly appears genuine, and I wouldn't be at all surprised that Sugarmann would get an FFL in order to do 'research' as the document suggests. The problem is, 'appearing to be genuine' is not the threshold we need to meet. We don't know whose Google document account this is - nor is a Google docs page a verifiable source. The FOIA that unearthed the document is not provided and thus unverifiable. The document only shows that Sugarmann may have ''had'' an FFL in the early 2000's - it does not establish that he currently has one, as the edit suggests. Likewise, the edit claims that they are rare in Washington D.C. - also something that wouldn't generate any surprise from me, but we need a reliable source for that, not the author's feelings. And lastly, it doesn't belong in the lede unless and until the details I am questioning are fleshed out within the body of the article. I'd appreciate if others could weigh in. We had a mini-revert war going, but no discussion is taking place. I'm not willing to risk censure over this matter.

Should the WP article on Schopenhauer, which currently includes a short list of prominent thinkers who were influenced by him, mention George Bernard Shaw?  In the introduction to ''[[Major Barbara]]'', Shaw points out that numerous contemporary critics considered it obvious that his (Shaw's) ideas were heavily influenced by Schopenhauer, but, Shaw denied this, perhaps jokingly.  I myself think that the commonalities are so significant, and Shaw's role in popularizing Schopenhauer's basic ideas in the English-speaking world so consequential, that the article is fundamentally incomplete unless it mentions Shaw. And surely Shaw's own comment about the question is a reliable source!  

Also, maybe the whole list of thinkers influenced by Schopenhauer should be moved from the lead paragraph to elsewhere in the article, according to [[WP:LEAD]]; maybe into a new section entitled "Prominent thinkers influenced by Schopenhauer" or some such.

What say you, fellow Shaw-junkies and Schopenhauer-freaks?

Hello. I would like to propose adding a {{para|cite}} field to verify the codes. Much like the College color module (and anything else on Wikipedia), we need to prove where we received the hex codes, not just add them. I could go through and type the hex codes when using the 'inspect element' tool on the team websites, but they may be different than those listed in a brand guide and others could disagree with the changed colors. If there is no way to verify, we need to come up with another solution.

This is a follow-up to the [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)#Allow_users_in_the_Account_Creator_user_group_to_add_users_to_the_Confirmed_user_group|previous RfC about extending the Account Creator user group]]. Per the comments in that RfC, there seems to be general agreement that there should be some technical means for people who have experience running edit-a-thons and similar events (and have a proven track record of successfully onboarding new editors) to be able to work around the limitations of [[WP:ACTRIAL]] during its duration—specifically, the limitation that non-autoconfirmed users can't create new articles. The main objection raised in the previous RfC was that the Account Creator user group wasn't a good user group to use for this purpose since it is given out freely to editors who haven't been adequately vetted for the ability to onboard new editors and thus shouldn't be trusted to grant autoconfirmed status to other users. For this RfC I am proposing the following:
* A new user group is created called <code>Event coordinators</code> with the following rights: <code>noratelimit</code> (can create more than six accounts in a 24-hour period with Special:CreateAccount), ability to add group <code>Confirmed users</code> (See [[WP:CONFIRM]]).
* This new user group will have the following requirements to be granted:
** User must be auto-confirmed themselves
** User must have a proven record of running successful Wikipedia editing events
** User must have good understanding of key Wikipedia policies and guidelines related to article creation

{{rfcquote|text=
Hello, fellow Wikipedians! {{u|Kolja21}} and I were having having a [[de:Benutzer_Diskussion:Kolja21#File:EU28-further_enlargement_map.svg|debate]] (in German) over which countries should be included in the map. Unfortunately, we were unable to resolve the dispute between the two of us, and I am hence writing to you in order to spark a wider discussion on the matter.

I believe that the map should also color Russia green ("membership ''possible''" -- I'm putting an accent on the latter word), but Kazakhstan should remain gray. My main point for this is that according to the Treaty on European Union, Article 49, every European country can join provided it fulfills certain criteria. Then comes the question of which countries are European to begin with. The European Union provides the answer to this [https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries at their official website]: scroll down to the list of "other European countries," where you can see Russia listed as one (and not Kazakhstan). I believe there possibly couldn't be any authority that could be more reliable on further EU expansion than the EU itself.

To this I have not heard any objections. However, a few other points were raised that were meant to show the impracticality of coloring Russia green. However, I did not find any of them particularly prohibitive and overcoming the argument above:

*"Russia does not fulfill the Copenhagen criteria." True. But then again, this does not make membership impossible, because there is a chance the criteria are met and then the country could be accepted. Compare to the case of Morocco, in which membership is impossible no matter what the country does. (Except, of course, for attaining some European territory, but a map cannot reflect such a possibility.) In addition to that, this does not seem to be the problem in case of all EaP countries, so it couldn't be the problem here.

*"The Caucasus countries, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova all participate in Eastern Partnership, which Russia does not do." That is not relevant at all. First, Eastern Partnership is not concerned with future membership of these countries. Here is the first sentence of the article [[Eastern Partnership]] past the lead section: "The Eastern Partnership complements the Northern Dimension and the Union for the Mediterranean by providing an institutionalised forum for discussing visa agreements, free trade deals, and strategic partnership agreements with the EU's eastern neighbours, while avoiding the controversial topic of accession to the European Union." Second, Russia not participating in EaP does not in any way deny it of a possibility of a future membership. As the saying goes, "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" (except the evidence in question is not really evidence to begin with).

*"Russia's membership anytime soon is very improbable." Yes, that's exactly what it looks like. But the map does not say, "membership probable"; it says, "membership possible." (Also, from what I know, a vast majority of people did not see around 1980 the European communism would crumble in a decade and a great number of those former communist countries would be parts of the EEC (which later became the EU) in less than 25 years.) But even saying that Russia certainly couldn't join in an equal period of time from now solely on that basis is the OR I am trying to avoid in this map (even though it looks very unlikely, we're not talking about "likely"; we're talking about "possible").

*This is an exact quote, translated by Google Translate: "If you do not agree with a frequently used graphics and can not convince the creators of the map from your point of view, you can not simply change them by yourself, but you have to create your own graphics. Anything else would be cheating on the authors, which they deliberately incorporated as file him their articles." First of all, factual errors do not fall under this description. Second of all, authors' feelings play no role at all. Moreover, if feelings even come up in a discussion like this, then it is most certain this quote from a Commons guideline should be applied: [[commons:Commons:Ownership_of_pages_and_files#Control_of_Wikimedia_content|"You can't stop everyone in the world from editing "your" stuff, once you've posted it to a Wikimedia project"]].

*Another exact translated quote: "The selection in the map is also conclusive in this respect, since there are also no Russian efforts to join the Eastern Partnership or even to apply for membership of the EU. Instead, the Eurasian Economic Union (EAWU) was founded as a counter-project." First, "no Russian efforts" is by no means "no possibility," as common logic dictates. Second, I couldn't find any traces of Azerbaijani efforts; yet Azerbaijan is not denied the possibility. I couldn't think of any practical Belorussian attempts to join, either (EU sanctions against particular Belorussian individuals and companies were only abolished last year), and the country is also a founding member of the said Eurasian Union; Armenia made a faithful decision to join in 2014. Third, the Eurasian Union was not meant -- or at least declared -- as the counter-project to the EU. According to Putin in 2011, "Some of our neighbours explain their reluctance to participate in advanced integration projects in the post-Soviet space by saying it allegedly contradicts their European choice. This is a false divide. The Eurasian union will be built on universal principles of integration as an integral part of greater Europe, united by common values of freedom, democracy and market laws." Fourth, even if it were, it does not mean that a country couldn't leave this union for the EU. This has even happened in the past a number of times: some examples to begin with are Sweden (leaving EFTA) and Poland (leaving CEFTA). Lastly, there shouldn't be any selection in the first place. I applied simple criteria rather than making editorial decisions. Editorial decisions are fine in minor contexts (what color to choose) but not when it comes to facts.

Then again, none of these precisely contradicts my general point, which is: every European country is granted a right for membership in the EU under certain conditions; Russia is recognized as a European country by the EU; therefore, it is correct to include under "membership possible" (and not correct not to do so). Maybe the map was intended to show something else; then, however, it should say something else in its legend.

I'd love to hear from you on this topic. When I suggested we have a wider dialogue, I invited Kolja to a future (=this) discussion, but he rejected the offer. I will send (upd: have sent) a link to this discussion just in case, anyway.--[[User:R8R|R8R]] ([[User talk:R8R#top|talk]]) 19:57, 18 August 2017 (UTC)}}

So far, we have a solid consensus not to count Israel as belligerent nor supporter at the [[Syrian Civil War]] page, but it appears that other Syrian Civil War related pages are becoming confused - one page claiming this and the other claiming that, with much lower editorial participation in decisions. This doesn't seem to be logical and consistent and hence I would like to ask editors whether the consensus achieved at RfC above (Israel is not a notable belligerent nor supporter) is to be applied to all other Syrian Civil War topic pages, including for instance [[Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War]] and [[Quneitra offensive (June 2017)]].

'''Further explanation:''' According to [[WP:CITEVAR]], "citations within any given article should follow a consistent style". As this article existed up till August 2017 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norse_religion&oldid=792420751]), that was not the case, with a wide variety of different citation styles being employed. As there was no community of editors active on the page, I was [[WP:BOLD]] and in my expansion of the article standardised the referencing using Option 1, the sfn/harv style ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norse_religion&oldid=796906735]). I considered it particularly appropriate given that this is the citation system employed at thematically linked articles like [[Norse mythology]] and the FA-rated [[Heathenry (new religious movement)]]; alternately, related articles like [[List of Germanic deities]] use a system like option 2. [[User:Yngvadottir]] has since started rewriting the article's prose, replacing instances of option 1 with a mix of options 3 and 4, on the basis that these are easier to edit with. Concerns have been raised by [[User:PBS]] that option 3 generates confusion in the context of this article, because "Andren, p. 56" does not stipulate which of Andren's works (for instance) is being referred to (multiple works by the same author are cited in this article). As per Wikipedia policy, there needs to be a standardised system introduced and the decision which to adopt should be made via [[WP:Consensus]], after which all editors should abide by it in their edits.

:'''Should the Infobox image of a woman holding her head be removed?'''

I believe so because: 
*it is distracting: Image is very large, and takes your attention from the matter at hand.
*it is a poor image:  poorly lit, poorly composed, background is overexposed, everything beneath her wrists can be cropped
*it doesn't illustrate properly: Our article on GSW doesn't show a shot man writhing on the ground. Our article on [[Heart attack]]s doesn't show a senior clutching his chest. [[Ovarian torsion|Torsioned ovary]] doesn't show a woman bring loaded into an ambulance on her way to ER. 

I disagree with [[User:Doc James]] on his points for the above reasons. I feel the image rapidly distracts from the topic at hand and fails to illustrate any difference between Tension headache and any other [[Headache]]. And I don't approve of that image either, though it is better composed. I am aware that articles like [[depression]] and [[ADHD]] have images along the same lines. <small>But [[Erectile dysfunction]] doesn't! </small> If a picture is going to be included for this article, '''can a better one be submitted?'''

{{hatnote|Moved from [[Wikipedia talk:Teahouse]] to formalize the [[WP:RFC|request for comment]].}}

[[Wikipedia:Editor review]] (ER) was a process for editors to receive feedbacks on their editing before it was [[Wikipedia_talk:Editor_review#Mark_Historical.3F|marked historical in May 2014]]. While the page received consistent traffic and requests, there was always minimal reviewer activity. In October 2015, there were two discussions ([[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Optional RfA candidate poll|1]] and [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Archive 239#Revisiting Editor Review|2]]) that took place concurrently to figure out some kind of process to replace some of the former functions of ER, one of which was to serve as a platform to solicit opinions from the community before [[WP:RFA|running for adminship]]. The former (optional poll) was adopted, while the latter discussion never received the consensus needed for revival. Do you think it would be a reasonable idea to revive this page?

{{rfcquote|text=
Since January of this year, editors have been conflicted about which pronouns to use in Quinn's BLP article. As a result of controversies and events in the subject's life ([[Gamergate]] is the obvious one), any discussion like this can become contentious, heated, and personal. But the point of Wikipedia is to rise above these controversies and display facts from as close to a [[WP:NPOV]] as possible, while following the [[WP:BLP]] guidelines as closely as possible. In this case, the relevant guidelines are [[MOS:GENDERID]], which clearly states that we should "give precedence to self-designation as reported in the most up-to-date reliable sources, even when it doesn't match what's most common in reliable sources." I'll summarize the points made by all sides below:

:In the case of Quinn, some editors pointed to [https://web.archive.org/web/20170402213912/https://thezoequinn.tumblr.com/post/155785701663/a-gender a blog post published on the subject's personal tumblr] that says "I don’t ever want to have the pronouns conversation because I feel equally apathetic to being called “he” or “she” so I guess if you just want to be accurate go for “they” but I won’t be offended by any." In this, the subject remarks on apathy for gendered PGPs, but defaults to "they/their/them." 
:Some editors remarked on their distaste for the [[Singular they]], but wikipedia is pretty clear on this. The singular they is a perfectly acceptable use of english grammar on this site. As is stated in MOS:GENDERID, it does require a note of explanation when nonconventional or if it would be confusing to the general public.
:Further complicating the issue is that Quinn has since deleted the blog post in question. Whether a deleted blog post can still be said to be the author's "most up-to-date" "self-designation" is up for debate.
:Numerous reliable sources from the source's publisher,<ref>{{cite web|title=Crash Override: How Gamergate (Nearly) Destroyed My Life, and How We Can Win the Fight Against Online Hate|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/crash-override-zoe-quinn/1126093101|website=Barnes & Noble|publisher=PublicAffairs|accessdate=16 September 2017|language=en}}</ref> personal website,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Quinn|first1=Zoë|title=Crash Override|url=https://zoequinn.squarespace.com/crash-override|website=Zoë Quinn|publisher=SquareSpace|accessdate=16 September 2017}}</ref> and retweeted, blogged, and referenced by the subject use "she/her/hers."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Malone|first1=Noreen|title=The Woman Targeted by Gamergate on Surviving a World-Altering Trolling Attack|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/07/zoe-quinn-surviving-gamergate.html|website=Select All|publisher=New York Magazine|accessdate=16 September 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Burns|first1=Katelyn|title=Zoe Quinn on Surviving Gamergate and the Rise of the Alt-Right|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/9k3wy8/zoe-quinn-on-surviving-gamergate-and-the-rise-of-the-alt-right|website=Broadly|publisher=Vice News|accessdate=16 September 2017|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/transscribe/status/908381568481288192|title=Twitter|publisher=Katelyn Burns (Twitter)|accessdate=16 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Myst Galaxy Books|url=https://twitter.com/MystGalaxyBooks/status/908390157291843584|publisher=Myst Galaxy Books (Twitter)|accessdate=16 September 2017}}</ref> But, as has been noted in MOS:GENDERID, this isn't about what is published the most widely.

On July 25th 2017, Washington D.C. Capitol Police, the FBI and Customs and Border Protection, were involved in the arrest of [[Imran Awan]] at [[Dulles International Airport]] as he tried to catch a flight to Pakistan. 

Awan was Wasserman-Schultz' DNC IT staffer. Awan plead not guilty to bank fraud, where he was accused of attempting to transfer several hundred thousand dollars to a Pakistani bank.  
This hill staffer had been employed by Wasserman Schultz as of the date where he was arrested.

{{rfcquote|text=
Hi all,

I'm proposing a change to the [[WP:PROF|notability guideline for academics]].

I am aware that a ''similar'' proposal was mooted about a year ago, however it was argued merely on the grounds of [[WP:GNG]] compliance whereas I am also arguing the case on consistency with other guidelines.  In other words, don't speedily close it on the grounds that it's already been discussed.

The sidebar on the [[WP:NOTABILITY|notability]] page gives eleven subject-specific notability guidelines, excluding the academic guideline.

These are:
*[[WP:NASTRO]], which specifically states {{tq|These criteria do not supersede WP:NOTABILITY, they merely supplement and clarify it within the context of astronomical objects. If an astronomical object does not meet the general notability guideline, especially if it lacks evidence of significant coverage in independent, reliable sources, then it risks being merged or redirected to an existing article, or deleted altogether.}}
*[[WP:NBOOK]], which specifically states {{tq|This is not an absolute guarantee that there will necessarily be a separate, stand-alone article entirely dedicated to that book.}}
*[[WP:NEVENT]], which specifically states {{tq|Events are probably notable if they have enduring historical significance and meet the general notability guideline, or if they have a significant lasting effect.}}
*[[WP:NFILM]], which specifically states {{tq|For the majority of topics related to film, the criteria established at the general notability guideline is sufficient to follow.}}
*[[WP:NGEO]], which specifically states {{tq|Per Wikipedia's Five pillars, the encyclopedia also functions as a gazetteer; therefore, geographical features meeting Wikipedia's General notability guideline (GNG) are presumed, but not guaranteed, to be notable.}}
*[[WP:NMUS]], which specifically states {{tq|Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; conversely, meeting any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. Rather, these are rules of thumb...}}
*[[WP:NNUMBER]], which doesn't mention the general notability guideline because numbers themselves don't really get coverage in themselves.  Maybe this could be changed but that's a separate issue.
*[[WP:NORG]], which specifically states {{tq|No organization is considered notable except to the extent that independent sources demonstrate that it has been noticed by people outside of the organization.}}  This is almost identical to the provisions laid out at [[WP:GNG]] so it complies with it in everything but name.
*[[WP:NPERSON]], which specifically states {{tq|Failure to meet these criteria is not conclusive proof that a subject should not be included; conversely, meeting one or more does not guarantee that a subject should be included.}}
*[[WP:NSPORT]], which specifically states {{tq|Please note that the failure to meet these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; conversely, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. These are merely rules of thumb...}}
*[[WP:NWEB]], which specifically states {{tq|These criteria are presented as rules of thumb for easily identifying web content that Wikipedia should probably have articles about. In almost all cases, a thorough search for independent, third-party reliable sources will be successful for content meeting one or both of these criteria. However, meeting these criteria is not an absolute guarantee that Wikipedia should have a separate, stand-alone article entirely dedicated to the content.}}

Please note that all of these guidelines either explicitly state that meeting their provisions and not the [[WP:GNG|general notability guideline]] (or just merely meeting their provisions) does not ''necessarily'' establish notability, or offer deference to the general notability guideline and incorporate it into their criteria.

However, [[WP:PROF]] is the only subject-specific guideline which explicitly states that its provisions supersede the general notability guideline and that the latter is irrelevant when discussing the notability of academics, specifically stating {{tq|If an academic is notable under this guideline, his or her failure to meet either the General Notability Guideline or other subject-specific notability guidelines is irrelevant.}}

The whole idea of a general notability guideline is that it can be applied to everything because it makes the process of establishing notability fair and even across different topics or at least evens the playing field.  While in practice at AfD, stubs on sportspeople who meet [[WP:NSPORT]] but not [[WP:GNG]] are likely to be kept under the former, [[WP:NSPORT]] specifically states that it is merely a {{tq|rule of thumb}} and is merely to be used as an easy method of ''interpreting [[WP:GNG]]: {{tq|The guideline on this page provides bright-line guidance to enable editors to determine quickly if a subject is likely to meet the General Notability Guideline.}}  I see no reason why we should allow academics to receive a free pass over the general notability guideline.  

'''Therefore, I propose that we remove the paragraph from [[WP:PROF]] which reads {{tq|This guideline is independent from the other subject-specific notability guidelines, such as WP:BIO, WP:MUSIC, WP:AUTH etc. and is explicitly listed as an alternative to the General Notability Guideline.[1] It is possible for an academic not to be notable under the provisions of this guideline but to be notable in some other way under one of the other subject-specific notability guidelines. Conversely, if an academic is notable under this guideline, his or her failure to meet either the General Notability Guideline or other subject-specific notability guidelines is irrelevant.}}'''

Thanks,

See the bottom of the [https://philpapers.org/surveys/demographics.pl demographic statistics of the PhilPapers surveys] with the heading "Non-living philosophers most identified with". Since Hume came before Kant, the top three would be: Plato, Hume, Kant.

Even better yet, replace Plato with Aristotle. But Plato does have historical significance; arguably the Western philosophy proper starts with Plato, so I don't make the proposal here. [[User:Ailenus|Ailenus]] ([[User talk:Ailenus#top|talk]]) 14:14, 29 August 2017 (UTC)}}

Worldbruce, Is there anything I could change, add, or remove from my article to help it get reconsidered? Is the problem my references? Is it because the independent ones still cover the same topic (vegetarian and vegan culture)? If so, that’s a tough one because it’s a niche magazine. Just like when I read a Wikipedia article on a video game where the references are mostly videogame magazines and websites, vegan magazines are mostly written about by other vegetarian and vegan media outlets. The NYTimes and cnn.com are unlikely to do a writeup on this magazine’s formation and history. The mainstream media largely ignores the vegan movement, but it persists, in growing numbers, with vegan media outlets supporting one another in a word-of-mouth sort of way, and this magazine has been an important and historic part of that movement. You mentioned Billboard and Wall Street Journal as examples. This magazine isn’t as big as those publications, but it’s still notable. It has international distribution, which is a huge deal for a magazine that covers this topic. I don’t know if you live in the U.S., but you could go into any Whole Foods, Barnes and Noble, or Sprouts (just to name a few) and pick up a copy, and it’s also widely available in health food stores and high-end booksellers throughout Canada and the UK.

Is the problem my conflict of interest? I don’t feel that I’ve written the article using any non-neutral language or misrepresenting any facts. I read the rules – or thought I did, I might be missing something – before writing the article and I feel I was hearing “we recommend not writing about a company you work for” and not “don’t write about a company you work for.” If I misunderstood that please correct me. I’m not trying to trick anyone or misrepresent any facts. Yes, I created my Wikipedia account because I wanted to write this article. Yes, I work for the company I’m writing about. No, I don’t want it to sound like an advertisement, and that wasn’t my reason for writing this article. I’m writing it because of the countless people who have approached my coworkers and myself wanting to learn more about this magazine’s creation and history, and because of all the people, casually or otherwise, who’ve said they couldn’t believe they couldn’t find anything about this magazine’s history on Wikipedia. I’m confident that, should I give up on this article, someday someone outside the company will write an article on this magazine for Wikipedia, but I didn’t want to give up just yet because I’ve put a lot of time into it, and I don’t feel that I’ve done anything particularly or irreparably wrong here. Any advice you can give is appreciated as I am, admittedly, new to this. [[User:Rpfergu|Rpfergu]] ([[User talk:Rpfergu|talk]]) 17:14, 28 September 2017 (UTC)}}

I believe that a couple changes need to be made to the article.

1. Posobiec denounced the alt-right on Twitter, claiming that he is not part of the movement but rather of the [[alt-lite]] or [[New Right]]. See [https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/897499256746942464  https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/897499256746942464], along with the article of [[Paul Joseph Watson]]. The article's lede states that he has denounced the alt-right and has aligned himself with the new right. The proposition that he is alt-right should be changed to the one I made earlier, stating that he has been described as alt-right by multiple sources, but has denounced it and identifies as something else. Keeping a claim that is disputed by the subject of the article itself fails NPOV.

2. In the notable activities section of the article, a claim is made that Posobiec "led a campaign to discredit anti-Trump protesters by planting a 
"Rape Melania" sign. The source cited either needs to be improved, modified to state that there are allegations that he did such a thing, or the claim should be removed altogether. See https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/inside-the-alt-rights-campaign-to-smear-trump-protesters-as?utm_term=.kgrE2dmY4#.ykbQJ7xDr . It is a BuzzFeed article which I wouldn't consider a reliable source along with many others at Wikipedia. The evidence BuzzFeed provides are screenshots with his name attached to it, which anyone can do. It should be noted however, that the only other source that is ''somewhat reputable'' is the Daily Beast who reported on this, seen here: http://www.thedailybeast.com/jack-posobiec-pizzagate-and-seth-rich-conspiracy-theorist-has-top-secret-security-clearance . Posobiec also denied the claims seen here: https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/798697704469708802

There are several issues with the article that I think need to be addressed. This article is bordering on an almost wholly negative BLP that needs major source improvement. 60% of the article is a list of his controversial activities and it makes the article look almost like an attack page. For now, I will not revert the edits I proposed back, but I will tag the article while consensus is generated on how to proceed.

::2. ''The Moors were the Muslim inhabitants of the Maghreb, the Iberian Peninsula, Sicily, and Malta during the Middle Ages. They initially were the Berber autochthones of the Maghreb. The name was later also applied to Arabs.''

All opinions are welcome. [[User:Tarook97|Tarook97]] ([[User talk:Tarook97|talk]]) 04:08, 1 September 2017 (UTC)}}

The following revision is proposed to the three bullet points of [[MOS:DATEVAR]] (a.k.a. [[MOS:DATERET]]), which immediately follows [[MOS:DATETIES]]. The revision was developed from a very lengthy discussion higher up this talk page.

'''Proposed wording:'''
{{talk quote|1=<nowiki />
* If an article has evolved using predominantly one date format, this format should be used throughout the article unless there are reasons for changing it based on the topic's strong national ties or consensus on the article's talk page.
* If consensus on a preferred date format does not arise, retain the format chosen in the first major contribution that included a date.
* Where an article uses both date formats with neither predominating, and does not meet the requirements specified in [[MOS:DATETIES]], impose consistency throughout the article by using the date format chosen in the first major contribution that included a date.
}}

{{collapse top|left=y|title=Current wording:}}
* If an article has evolved using predominantly one date format, this format should be used throughout the article, unless there are reasons for changing it based on strong national ties to the topic or consensus on the article's talk page.
* The date format chosen by the first major contributor in the early stages of an article should continue to be used, unless there is reason to change it based on strong national ties to the topic or consensus on the article's talk page.
* Where an article has shown no clear sign of which format is used, the first person to insert a date is equivalent to "the first major contributor".
{{collapse bottom}}

The revised wording was chosen, from quite a selection of proposed variations, for maximum consistency and compatibility with other *VAR provisions, like [[MOS:ENGVAR]] and [[WP:CITEVAR]]. A specific goal of this revision is replacement of "contributor" with "contribution" to resolve [[WP:OWN]] problems. Another is to eliminate the excessive redundancy between the current first and second items. The inclusion of "throughout the article" in the third item is optional, as is "that included a date" in the same item, since both are already given in the first two items. Various minor copyedits can be made after the fact; please do not dwell on trivial punctuation or wording quibbles.<br /><span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 12:19, 21 September 2017 (UTC)}}

Mapframe is an extension that is being developed by the WMF to show small OpenStreetMap maps in articles. Background information is at [[:mw:Help:Extension:Kartographer]]. It is currently enabled on some Wikipedias that have opted in, and I think it would be useful here as well. Personally, I'm interested in using this in Wikidata-driven infoboxes such as the one at [[Lovell Telescope]] to replace {{tl|Location map}} with OSM data, but it also has wider applications. I don't think that it interferes with existing coding here, so it just adds functionality that we can use. I can't spot any previous discussions about this, so I'm starting this discussion here to try to determine consensus. Also see [[phab:T138057]] and [[phab:T175102]] Thanks.

:'''Should the Infobox image of a woman holding her head be removed?'''

I believe so because: 
*it is distracting: Image is very large, and takes your attention from the matter at hand.
*it is a poor image:  poorly lit, poorly composed, background is overexposed, everything beneath her wrists can be cropped.
*it doesn't illustrate properly: Our article on GSW doesn't show a shot man writhing on the ground. Our article on [[Heart attack]]s doesn't show a senior clutching his chest. [[Ovarian torsion|Torsioned ovary]] doesn't show a woman bring loaded into an ambulance on her way to ER. 

I disagree with [[User:Doc James]] on his points for the above reasons. I feel the image rapidly distracts from the topic at hand and fails to illustrate any difference between Tension headache and any other [[Headache]]. And I don't approve of that image either, though it is better composed. I am aware that articles like [[depression]] and [[ADHD]] have images along the same lines. <small>But [[Erectile dysfunction]] doesn't! </small> If a picture is going to be included for this article, '''can a better one be submitted?'''

First forgive me if I am doing this wrong as I am new to Wikipedia.  I have had a problem editing on the page mentioned (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_ether_theory) using a certain source that always gets reverted. I had made the adddition that a neo-Lorentzian Theory was still an active area of research and dialogue. Then I cited the 3 Volumes edited by Michael C. Duffy, Joseph Lèvy and one Volume was edited by Volodymyr Krasnoholovets. I was told that it was reverted because there was not a quote on this by them saying exactly that. I explained that that was the purpose of the book which shows it is by them (it is a compilation of articles by Physicists on the their research and talking about it) so I didn't understand why that was needed. It got nowhere. So today I decided to add in a words that are mine but made explicit in the text instead then. I added in that it is explicit this time. I also gave information on who the editors were (I previously mentioned at least another previously who is in the book namely Franco Selleri and that a previous book by one of the editors was Jean-Paul Vigier who helped comment on it and supported him so as to help forestall uneasiness about the editor and contributer of the book I cite, I did not mention Simon J. Prokhovnik or others who did as well. Nor anyone one else in the Volumes mentioned as there are many). Unfortunately it was reverted again as he said the Publisher was a fringe source even though I gave (via links) the qualifications of the editors and their contribution in the foreward, it seems like an ad hominen perhaps as they are modern neo-Lorentzian's. I did not talk with him again as it appears to me that the excuses changed as to why it cannot be included and this makes me feel uneasy and quit upset as I am trying my best. Anyway sorry for the long comment. Thanks for your help.

There were 6 !votes and the close was [[nationalism]]; this result was extended to the body of the article as well.  The issue remains unsettled, as people come by and change it back and forth.

[[WP:RAPID]] is perhaps the most antithetical policies on Wikipedia. According to RAPID it is best not to rush to create an article:
:''It is wise to delay writing an article about a breaking news event until the significance of the event is clearer as early coverage may lack perspective and be subject to factual errors. Writing about breaking news may be recentism, and Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. It is recommended that editors start a section about the event within an existing article on a related topic if possible, which may later be split into its own article if the coverage suggests that the event is independently notable.''
However, in the same breadth, it advices us not to rush to delete articles. Writers completely disregard the first section of the policy but regularly apply a rationale at AfD similar to this: "Per RAPID. Let us wait for more reports before deleting the article". When we allow this "logic" to flourish at AfD, we are encouraging editors to disregard the criteria outlined by [[WP:EVENTCRIT]] in favor of their good ol' ace in the hole: "Keep... well because RAPID".
*For that reason I propose we include a disclaimer in RAPID similar to this: ''RAPID cannot be the basis for keeping an article on a current event. A participant at an [[WP:AfD|article deletion discussion]] must apply the criteria for inclusion of an event''.[[User:TheGracefulSlick|TheGracefulSlick]] ([[User talk:TheGracefulSlick|talk]]) 23:30, 7 September 2017 (UTC)}}

The question is thus: '''should the ISIS claim that Paddock was ideologically influenced by the group be included in the article?'''

A summary of media responses citing a single New York Times editorial has been provided in the header. Two from National Review were provided to cite the relevant counter-opinion but deleted with the justification of it being "just one opinion" (as though the adjacent one were not).

Subsequently, an edit war ensued over the insertion of a quote deemed relevant for quotation by NBC which has been demanded by a consensus of politically aligned editors to be unacceptable to reprint for fear of conspiracy theorizing, even though it could be made clear that heart attack due to trauma is perfectly common, and as though that were a reason to arbitrarily obfuscate information anyhow.

Among the prevailing consensus, this [[WP: NPOV]] and [[WP: AGF]] gem:

Regardless, and as requested, multiple sources from the likes of Newsweek and the Washington Post were added to the counterpoint in the header, but deleted on the justification that edits were not discussed, when the discussion page has devolved into referring to other users as "nazi civil-tards" without controversy.

Does there stand any coherent reason not to undo the following revision? https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unite_the_Right_rally&diff=802961526&oldid=802960642 <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Equilibrium103|Equilibrium103]] ([[User talk:Equilibrium103#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Equilibrium103|contribs]]) </small>

{{rfcquote|text=
Given all that's been said in the general-discussion RfC above, it is proposed here to change the third bullet of [[MOS:JOBTITLES]], on when to capitalize titles, to the following, including some additional examples (to make it clearer there isn't a different rule for civic and noble titles on Wikipedia):
* When a formal title (or conventional translation thereof) is addressed as a title or position in and of itself, is not plural, is not preceded by a modifier (including a definite or indefinite article), and is not a reworded description:
** {{xt|Richard Nixon was re-elected President of the United States on November 7, 1972.}} But: {{xt|Nixon was the 37th president of the United States.}} {{xt|Nixon was one of the more controversial American presidents.}} {{xt|Controversial US president Richard Nixon resigned.}}
** {{xt|Louis XVI became King of France and Navarre in 1774, later styled King of the French (1791–1792).}} But: {{xt|Louis XVI was a king of France.}}  {{xt|Louis XVI was the king of France when the French Revolution began.}} {{xt|French king Louis XVI was beheaded.}}

The present wording of this line item is:
* {{tq|When the correct formal title is treated as a [[Proper name (linguistics)|proper name]] (e.g., {{xt|King of France}}; it is correct to write {{xt|Louis XVI was King of France}} but {{xt|Louis XVI was the French king}})}}
It has been termed confusing and disputed, in multiple ways, including: perceptions of self-contradiction; conflicts between [[Proper name (linguistics)|linguistics]] and [[Proper name (philosophy)|philosophy]] conceptions of the meaning of "proper name"; complaints that "correct formal title" is PoV or simply meaningless; lack of guidance about cases of the form "<var>Name</var> was a/the <var>title</var>"; and implication that every occurrence of something like "King of France" should be capitalized regardless of context (e.g. use as a common-noun phrase or plural). <small>[This is not my personal opinion, but a summary of debate above and of previous discussions.]</small>

{{collapse top|left=y|title=The current wording of the entire section}}
{{fake heading|Titles of people}}
Offices, titles, and positions such as ''president'', ''king'', ''emperor'', ''pope'', ''bishop'', ''abbot'', and ''executive director'' are common nouns and therefore should be in lower case when used generically: {{xt|Mitterrand was the French president}} or {{xt|There were many presidents at the meeting.}} They are capitalized only in the following cases:
* When followed by a person's name to form a title, i.e., when they can be considered to have become part of the name: {{xt|President Nixon}}, not {{!xt|president Nixon}}
* When a title is used to refer to a specific and obvious person as a substitute for their name, e.g., {{xt|the Queen}}, not {{!xt|the queen}}, referring to [[Elizabeth&nbsp;II]]
* When the correct formal title is treated as a [[Proper name (linguistics)|proper name]] (e.g., {{xt|King of France}}; it is correct to write {{xt|Louis XVI was King of France}} but {{xt|Louis XVI was the French king}})

When an unhyphenated compound title such as ''vice president'' or ''chief executive officer'' is capitalized (unless this is simply because it begins a sentence),<ref>This includes headings, entries in tables and the like, where sentence case is used rather than title case.</ref> each word begins with a capital letter: {{xt|On October 10, 1973, Vice President Agnew resigned and Gerald Ford was appointed to replace him.}} This does not apply to unimportant words such as the "of" in {{xt|White House Chief of Staff John Doe}}. When hyphenated, as ''Vice-president'' is in some contexts other than U.S.&nbsp;politics, the second (and any subsequent) elements are not capitalized. 

Honorifics and [[Royal and noble styles|styles of nobility]] should normally be capitalized, e.g., {{xt|Her Majesty}}, {{xt|His Holiness}}, but see also {{section link|WP:Manual of Style/Biographies|Honorifics}}.
{{talkref}}
{{collapse bottom}}

I believe this proposal will be about the best compromise we can achieve any time soon, while the current wording is definitely confusing to a lot of editors and leading to recurrent dispute, while off-Wikipedia style guides do not give consistent advice on the matter, though they mostly lean in this direction, and the proposed solution should be stable for a long time.<br /><span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 17:16, 21 September 2017 (UTC)}}

<s>'''[[WP:JOBTITLES]] currently offers us conflicting advice with regard to capitalization.''' A general rule is stated that titles are “common nouns and therefore should be in lower case when used generically.” This includes “king” and “French king,” but not “King of France,” at least according to this puzzling example: “{{xt|Louis XVI was King of France}} but {{xt|Louis XVI was the French king}}." This example goes against the advice of ''The Chicago Manual of Style'', which gives "King Abdullah; the king of Jordan" (8.21) and “Charles I (king of England)” (16.98). This mistake has been in the Manual of Style for a long time. It at one point, it was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Capital_letters&oldid=212130034 supported by bogus CMOS and ''Guardian'' references]. In the archive, I found a history of editors puzzling over this passage, but no one who could explain what it means or where it came from. Various editors have, in good faith, interpreted the “King of France” example to mean that Wikipedia style is to upper case titles. This interpretation is in opposition to the rule the example is supposed to be illustrating. '''I propose that we resolve the conflict by removing the bulleted section with the “King of France” example.'''

'''Differences''' between the two seals include:
# Seal 2 has horizontal lines in the field of the shield (possibly [[hatching (heraldry)|hatching]] for the color blue) that are absent in Seal 1
# Seal 1 is full color while Seal 2 is black and white
# Seal 1 has a blue border around the shield while the shield in Seal 2 has no border
# The star in the top left corner of the shield is larger on Seal 2 than on Seal 1

The guidelines at [[WP:DAYS#Style]] state:
{{quotation|"References are not needed in Wikicalendar articles. However, references to support listed entries must be found in linked Wikipedia articles and not external links."}}
This seems to have been added years ago and is now taken as an obvious tenet.  However it seems to fly in the face of [[WP:V]] and specifically [[WP:BURDEN]].  I propose that this be changed to the wording from [[WP:BURDEN]]:
{{quotation|"Any material lacking a reliable source '''directly supporting it''' may be removed and should not be restored without an inline citation to a reliable source."}}

I know there is another RFC still open but it does not seem to be going anywhere meaningful. I propose to replace the section "Inclusion and exclusion criteria" with the following: 

*"Recent years pages are intended to provide an overview of events of ''international'' and ''lasting'' notability that occur during that year:
*In general, events meeting this criterion should recieve significant independent news reporting from at least three continents or should recieve coverage by multiple reliable sources as one of the most significant global events to have occured during that year. (For example in a year in review article in a major newspaper).
*Births or Deaths which recieve significant independent news reporting from three continents or recieve coverage by multiple reliable sources as one of the most important global events to have occured during that year are included in this criterion. 
*Some categories of  reccuring events often recieve significant international coverage but are still not usually of ''lasting'' notability. We have special additional rules to deal with these categories. If such events recieve coverage by multiple reliable sources as one of the most significant global events to have occured during that year this may be evidence that they are of unusual importance and should be included.

Then, we would retain the other sub-sections - with the exception of  the three continent rule, births and deaths which would be subsumed above. 

I think that this change would improve the balance of recent years articles. Dramatically reduce squabbling over dumb things and give a more balanced overall picture. There might be a lag with a few things until reliable sources start to round up a year but I think that is emmiently preferable to the current arbitrary standards which manage to be both too flexible (to allow random dead musicians and athletes who happen to be [[WP:BIAS]] beneficiaries) and too inflexible (not allowing election of Donald Trump on [[2016]] even though we can now clearly see it was one of the most significant events of the year.)

I am not a wiki policy wonk and I am sure there are some flaws in what i have put above, but we can correct small things later. I hope this would be a positive change that would fix a lot of the big issues we nearly all seem to acknowledge.

Following discussion at [[WP:AN#The Rambling Man]] and [[WP:VPP#Editing through protection]], I'd like to propose a system which will give editors with the Template Editor privilege (TEs) the ability to indirectly edit the Main Page (MP). 

There are five main templates that make up the MP. All of them are protected at admin level, and cascade protected. AFAIUI, it means that it is impossible to grant TEs the ability to directly edit the templates. However, it would appear that the is a way around this. If there were subpages of these templates, protected at TE level but outside cascade protection, TEs could edit them. Each template could take the name of the main template with /TE as its subtemplate name. An admin-level bot could then copy across any changes to the relevant template (it would also need to copy over any changes made to the main templates to the subtemplate). Thus allowing TEs to indirectly edit the MP without impinging on the cascade protection. This would increase the number of editors who are able to respond to issues raised at [[WP:ERRORS]].
TEs are obviously a trusted bunch of editors. The risk of vandalism to the main page would be very low, and any such instances could be swiftly dealt with by immediate removal of the privilege and other administrative action.

*'''2''' – Keep the statistics-based inclusion criteria but move all seven articles so that they do not have the culturally distinct term "one-hit wonder" in the article name, or
*'''3''' – Redirect all seven decade articles back to [[List of one-hit wonders in the United States]] while changing the inclusion criteria of the main article from any maths or statistics derivation to instead be a list of artists that have been called one-hit wonders in multiple reliable sources, with two sources cited for each entry.

'''Simple question:''' Which citation style should this article employ? 
*Option (1): <code><nowiki>{{sfn|Andren|2011|p=56}}</nowiki></code>
*Option (2): "Andren 2011: 56" (as plain text)

*Option (5): "Andren 2011, p. 56."
*Option (6): <code><nowiki>{{sfn|''Old Norse and Germanic Religion''|p=56}}</nowiki></code>

'''Further explanation:''' According to [[WP:CITEVAR]], "citations within any given article should follow a consistent style". As this article existed up till August 2017 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norse_religion&oldid=792420751]), that was not the case, with a wide variety of different citation styles being employed. As there was no community of editors active on the page, I was [[WP:BOLD]] and in my expansion of the article standardised the referencing using Option 1, the sfn/harv style ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norse_religion&oldid=796906735]). I considered it particularly appropriate given that this is the citation system employed at thematically linked articles like [[Norse mythology]] and the FA-rated [[Heathenry (new religious movement)]]. [[User:Yngvadottir]] has since started rewriting the article's prose, replacing instances of option 1 with a mix of options 3 and 4, on the basis that these are easier to edit with. Concerns have been raised by [[User:PBS]] that option 3 generates confusion in the context of this article, because "Andren, p. 56" does not stipulate which of Andren's works (for instance) is being referred to (multiple works by the same author are cited in this article). As per Wikipedia policy, there needs to be a standardised system introduced and the decision which to adopt should be made via [[WP:Consensus]], after which all editors should abide by it in their edits.

{{rfcquote|text=
The officially given recording dates on this album have been challenged by one of Morrison's biographers, [[Clinton Heylin]], in the 2003 book ''Can You Feel The Silence?''.[https://aux.avclub.com/clinton-heylin-van-morrison-can-you-feel-the-silence-1798198989]. Heylin's research is noted in the article (in the [[The_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(album)#Recording_dates|Recording dates]] section), and the alternative dates, with rationales, are given. However, Heylin's dates are also given in the [[The_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(album)#Track_listing|Track listing]] section as though authoritative. There has been some discussion on this matter  [[User_talk:Kitchen_roll#The_Philosopher.27s_Stone|here]].

Pursuant to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_requests#Bot_for_automatically_dating_redlinks this discussion], I'm opening an RfC to hopefully gain consensus on the creation of a bot that will automatically date redlinks.

My idea is that, similar to how [[:Template:Citation needed]] without specifying additional params will lead a bot to automatically date the template, a similar template be created to mark redlinks, which a bot (perhaps even the same bot) could then tag with the current month and year (if there's a way to forego the template and just have a bot detect and tag redlinks, even better). I feel it would be useful to be able to see, when editing an article, whether a redlink has been relatively newly-created, or has existed for some time, so that editors can make more informed decisions as to whether a redlink is really merited. Even if this was only applied to redlinks going forward (i.e. no searching through existing ones) I feel it would be an improvement over the current approach, where it can be difficult if not impossible to determine when a redlink was created. 

The linked discussion includes some thoughts on indexing redlinks and more advanced functionality, but for the purposes of this RfC I would consider that out of scope. If others feel the advanced options should be pursued, I would encourage them to say so in any ensuing discussion, or initiate a subsequent RfC.

Please indicate your support or opposition for the creation of such a bot (and associated template if necessary), and feel free to bring up any questions or concerns in the discussion section.

I propose to include the following footnote in MoS, which has various explanatory footnotes (keeps the main text more concise):

{{talk quote|1=A general term for the <code>.</code> character is ''full point'' or just ''point'', while the ''full stop'' is the role the character plays in terminating a sentence; not all style guides and dictionaries maintain it today {{crossref|(see {{section link|Full stop|History}} for more information)}}. In North American usage, it is usually referred to as a ''period'' regardless of role; in mathematics as a ''decimal point'' or ''point''; and in computer jargon often as a ''dot''. Use the same character for all of these roles. In particular, English Wikipedia does not use alternative [[decimal marks]].
}}

{{collapse top|left=y|bg=LightGrey|title=Ealier draft, revised above to account for some comments below:}}
{{talk quote|1=Technically, the term for the <code>.</code> character in general is ''full point'' or just ''point'', while the ''full stop'' is the role the character plays in terminating a sentence; while the distinction has been drawn since at least 1897, not all style guides and dictionaries maintain it today {{crossref|(see {{section link|Full stop|History}} for more information)}}. In North American usage it is usually referred to as a ''period'' regardless of role; in mathematics as a ''decimal point'' or ''point''; and in computer jargon often as a ''dot''.
}}
{{collapse bottom}}

The rationales for this are
*It's actually important that everyone be clear that ''full point'', ''full stop'', ''period'', ''decimal point'', and ''dot'' all refer to the same <code>.</code> glyph in different contexts. We take such care with various other punctuation matters, such as: quotation mark glyphs; the differences between different bracket types; distinctions between dashes of two kinds, the hyphen, and the minus; and so on.
*Two editors in two days have reverted previous attempts at clarification, with the counterfactual assertions that ''full point'' isn't correct or is somehow confusing, despite being what ''New Hart's Rules'' (the British counterpart to ''Chicago Manual of Style'') among other sources call the character in an overall sense.
My theory is it is better to have a clarifying footnote and precise terminology used contextually, than to have a slow editwar to force the same term (''full stop'') to be used in every context when this term is not universally used that way.

An editor has reverted the addition of this footnote, as well, so I'm opening this discussion about it.<br /><span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''']] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] &gt;<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>&lt; </span> 20:55, 11 October 2017 (UTC)}}

Currently [[Help:IPA for English|our IPA transcription system for English]] acknowledges the phoneme/[[diaphoneme]] {{IPA|/ɔər/}}, which is used only by a minority of General American speakers and no Received Pronunciation speakers (which are the only accents that are encoded by major dictionaries). Furthermore, it is transcribed in only some dictionaries and so transcribing it puts an unnecessary burden on editors who'd like to use e.g. ''Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary'' to source their IPA.

This is what I propose we add to the standard Reception section, not under any special heading that would lend undue weight. I am proposing this addition because this issue has been widely covered in the media including BBC, NBC and basically every single "tech" outlet, therefore warranting it at least a small mention in the article.

This is an extensive article about the history of the current of thought in Catalan nationalism in the late 19th and 20th century which held/developed the ideology that the Catalans were a superior, more racially pure and more European nationality than other ethnicities in Spain. The body of the article contains secondary academic sources and discussions and direct quotes from early and late Catalan intellectuals and Catalanist politicians expressing and developing such beliefs, such as [https://books.google.com.af/books?id=InmEAwAAQBAJ this one] in English (most other ones are in Spanish and Catalan). Certain editors claim the exact term "Catalan supremacism" is not being used in most of the sources (even though they all explain the ideology of catalan racial superiority with direct quotes), so having it in lead is POV and OR. The question is: Do sources which explain ideas of racial superiority and purity support the title (Catalan Supremacism) and the use of the term in the lead, or do we need the exact term "Catalan Supremacism" to be used in all of them? Reading the body of the article is suggested, since the technical issue to address is link between body and title/lead.[[User:Sonrisas1|Sonrisas1]] ([[User talk:Sonrisas1|talk]]) 03:02, 25 October 2017 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Based on the international opinion and that there is another page for the Catalan Republic, I suggest changing the first two introductory paragraph to: 

"Catalonia (Catalan: Catalunya, Occitan: Catalonha, Spanish: Cataluña) is a region of Spain in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula between the Mediterranean coast and the Pyrenees. Politically, Catalonia is considered by the Kingdom of Spain and the international community as one of 17 autonomous communities of Spain and has the designation of a Historic Nationality (Spanish nacionalidad histórica) by its Statute of Autonomy. However, the regional Catalan parliament views it as an independent state following a unilateral declaration of independence on 27 October 2017.

Catalonia consists of four provinces: Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona. The capital and largest city is Barcelona, the second-most populated municipality in Spain and the core of the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Catalonia comprises most of the territory of the former Principality of Catalonia (with the remainder Roussillon now part of France's Pyrénées-Orientales). It is bordered by France and Andorra to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the east, and the Spanish autonomous communities of Aragon to the west and Valencia to the south. The official languages are Catalan, Spanish, and the Aranese dialect of Occitan."

In the late 8th century..."

It is proposed that the ''Timeless'' skin available at [[:mw:Skin:Timeless]] is added to the en-wikipedia configuration as a optional skin which could be enabled in user preferences. There are currently 5 skins available in preferences. This will be the sixth.

The current default skin that controls how most people see Wikipedia is ''Vector''; this '''will not change'''.

Unless an individual user wants to use the ''Timeless'' skin and enables it in their preferences, it will not be visible or change the user interface in any way. This skin has been tested and is currently enabled as a non-default preference on other Wikipedia including the French language Wikipedia, Wiktionary (fr), Wikinews (fr) and on the MediaWiki wiki.

Please don't oppose this just because you don't like it; you never have to know it is there, it will not affect any other skins or appearance settings. It is a completely optional choice, new users will still use Vector, and everyone who doesn't change their settings will still use Vector (or their other skin choice such as Monobook).

*Rename to Catalan-speaking territories as per [[WP:NPOV]], [[WP:RELIABLE]],[[WP:FRINGE]]

*'''Rename/Support''' "Catalan countries" is a highly politicized and controversial name which is used in most English and Spanish language sources as "so-called Catalan countries" - normally referring to Catalan political expansionism. It is highly controversial in most areas it purports to include and its use is avoided even by many Catalan nationalists to avoid alienating its neighbors. As such it is a POV term. I don't think the article should be deleted but title should at least be NPOV. There is no such thing as Catalan countries except as an irredentist political project which is extremely unpopular everywhere outside Catalonia. However, there are territories where Catalan is spoken - this is a reality. The only sources which use it without a qualifier (which implies it is controversial) are those under the orbit of the Catalan independence movement. So rename as per WP:NPOV.[[User:Sonrisas1|Sonrisas1]] ([[User talk:Sonrisas1|talk]]) 04:26, 2 November 2017 (UTC)}}

Hello. I believe that the Spanish empire should have a map of JUST the Spanish empire without the claimed territories, Habsburg dominions, and Dynastic unions. My [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Location_of_the_Spanish_Empire.png image] I've posted earlier is just that. The image is simpler to understand and decently accurate. The map that JavierNF96 posted is inaccurate in some areas, and is too vague in the pink color coding, as it can represent several different meanings. The map that {{u|Ruepc}} posted is much better and more accurate. However in my opinion, it should not be posted as the infobox picture, as it is misleading to what is actually the Spanish empire. An image like Ruepc's should be posted somewhere else in the article, hence it already is in section 2. Please share your thoughts and hopefully we can come up with a resolution. Thanks.

I copied this discussion from [[Talk:Asahi-ekimae-dōri Station]] because it is inaccessible due to a bot-bug which does not handle unicode characters.  The basis of the discussion is the same.

We have 200,000 unreferenced articles. Several hundred of these are articles on tram stops and train stations.  There is no doubt that they exist. They are in linked lists of the previous and next stations. They are named places (of a sort) and therefore are assumed to have inherent notability. Many have photographs. Some perhaps have references in another language.  The ones addressed here have no secondary references.  They fail [[WP:GNG]].  I know editors like these articles.  Well composed PRODS are reverted without comment or improvement.  I am asking for a discussion of a policy here. I reject the first option, letting these articles molder for another ten years.  One of the next two is what we need to decide on -- if another easy option is not proposed:
# No action 
# Remove the unreferenced tag if the article seems to be legit.  This would appear to be in contravention to [[WP:GNG]]
# Delete the articles in one fell swoop, or at least allowing a speedy for each one. [[User:Rhadow|Rhadow]] ([[User talk:Rhadow|talk]]) 20:45, 6 October 2017 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
Currently, [[WP:NOTMEMORIAL]] states that "Wikipedia is not the place to memorialize deceased friends, relatives, acquaintances, or others who do not meet [the requirements at [[WP:BLP]]]". Many, including myself, have interpreted this as prohibiting lists of victims in the articles of tragedies. However, many others disagreed, and in June 2016 there was [[Talk:2016 Orlando nightclub shooting#Archive 6#RfC: List of victims|a discussion]] as to whether to add such a list to [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]]. In the closing statement, it was suggested that while there is a precedent to include such lists, such precedent may conflict with NOTMEMORIAL, and a separate RfC should be held about the general interpretation of the NOTMEMORIAL and to determine whether or not a list of victims violates the policy. Indeed, local consensus for [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]] was "to allow the list untill it is either removed to a separate article or a higher level consensus abolishes the use of such lists acrosss wikipedia" ''<small><nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sic]]]</small>''. The full closing statement by {{u|Maunus}} is below for reference:
:I count 22 !votes to include vs. 16 to exclude. However, several arguments for excluding are temporary opening the possibility of having separate page listing the victims. The argument against is WP:NOTMEMORIAL, which suggests that wikipedia should not memorialize people who are not themselves notable biographic subjects. Arguments for allowing, suggest that WP:MEMORIAL does not apply to embedded lists in articles, and point out the precedentfor having such lists in other articles about mass shootings. I think that there is a conflict between WP:MEMORIAL and the existing precendent, but this should be addressed in a separate RfC about the general interpretation of the WP:MEMORIAL. In such an RfC i would vote to exclude lists of victims in articles on mass deaths (especially given the inequal possibilities afforded different kinds of victims in different pats of the world), but in this case the local consensus regarding this article in specific is to allow the list untill it is either removed to a separate article or a higher level consensus abolishes the use of such lists acrosss wikipedia.

That brings us here. I propose that we add a line to [[WP:NOTMEMORIAL]] that would '''prohibit listing individual victims of tragedies if they do not meet [[WP:N|our notability guidelines]] and/or [[WP:BLP]]'''. This would apply to not just lists, but general naming of non-notable victims as well, either in the article or as a separate article. This proposal, if approved, would also override any local consensus and precedents.

I'm doing this as [[WP:BOLD|a pre-emptive measure]] because there seem to have been quite a lot of user categories and userboxes that are being brought to the attention of both [[WP:CFD]] and [[WP:MFD]]. The earliest discussion I can find is [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2017 February 14#Category:Politically leftist Wikipedians]], which saw both that category and an equivalent for right-wing Wikipedians get deleted. It seems that for awhile things were quiet, until we had this discussion, [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2017 September 4#Category:Wikipedians who are against Donald Trump]], which also saw that category get deleted. I've nominated a category recently myself, but only one, and I didn't realize how widespread these materials are, or how much momentum this trend of nominating these things is gaining. There is also [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2017 October 6#Political support categories]], which seems to be gaining a steady delete consensus (it's about user categories that specifically and unambiguously endorse candidates on both sides of the spectrum). Elsewhere, however, the solution is not so clear-cut, with many categories, in the view of users such as myself, expressing support for one sociopolitical viewpoint or another without using it to imply interest in collaboration with other Wikipedians in editing those same topic areas regardless of whether they personally agree with each other. Personally, my view is that these userboxes stand in clear violation of [[WP:UBCR]], while the categories violate [[WP:User categories#Inappropriate types of user categories]], namely "Categories which group users by advocacy of a position". This is not merely a fringe view either, as there's enough of us who think this way that it's clouding consensus on the issue, warranting broader discussion.

I believe the best way to go about this is to list examples of what might end up being discussed at either MFD or CFD. I encourage others to add to it, but within reason - this is {{em|not}} a substitute for discussion at either venue. Whether we decide to keep them or get rid of them, we'll likely still have to take it over there. It is not my goal to try to circumvent either venue; it is not merely about these specific examples or others like them, but the idea of them as a whole. I just want to nip this in the bud and give us some peace of mind. If you add something to this list, please leave a ping for the user who originally made it unless that user has already been pinged here.

Keep in mind that userboxes can also be categorized in a confrontational way, so on the face of it they may seem to express a message everyone can agree with, but in adding them to your own page you'll add a category you may not necessarily feel you belong in. Userboxes may be kept, but should be recategorized as the community sees fit. Feel free to point out problematic categorization wherever you see it.

And that of {{u|Jack Sebastian}}:
: [[Jamie Chung]] as [[Blink (comics)|Clarice Fong / Blink]]: A "sarcastic, lively" mutant with teleportation powers.<ref name="Chung" /> An "independently minded" member of the mutant underground, Blink begins the series using her abilities as "a way out of situations she doesn't want to be in", but her abilities and relationship to them evolve throughout the series.<ref name="NixCBRSep20173" /> Nix wanted to use the series as a chance to develop the character further than her appearance in the film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'',<ref name="NixCBRSep20173" /> Chung credits her casting as Blink to the increased diversity of Asians in films and television.<ref name="Chung2" />
I believe that since we discuss the version of the character from the films as well as this television version, we need to note that a different actress played the character in the film so we aren't implying to readers who haven't watched the films that Chung was in them. Jack Sebastian believes that since the connections between the show and films are not clearly defined (there has been a lot of back-and-forth regarding this as can be seen in the article, though the consensus from the series' showrunner seems to be that the show is connected to the films via an alternate timeline plot device) there should be no mention of the film actress at all. I also have interpreted [http://www.cbr.com/the-gifted-jamie-chung-blink-interview/ this interview] as Chung praising some notable examples of Asian American representation, and then noting that she was likely only considered for the role because an Asian actress was cast for the film (given that the character is not Asian in the comics). Jack Sebastian interprets the same interview as Chung feeling that she was only cast in the role because of a growing trend in Asian American representation. There doesn't appear to be any compromise between the two coming, so we are hoping for some outside opinions here.

There are multiple issues on the page on the Catalan independence referendum. They are mainly regarding POV, relevance and wording. They involve several recent editors: myself ([[User:Munci]]), [[User:BallenaBlanca]], [[User:Crystallizedcarbon]], [[User:Impru20]] and [[User:BrendonTheWizard]].

Specific issues include the changing statistics, prominence of the word 'illegal' and the relevance and description of injuries described in different ways by different sources.

The statistics for injuries to Spanish policemen changed dramatically from the 1st October to the 2nd October. The change involved having much wider inclusion criteria: rather than just including those who had received medical treatment, the Spanish government started including those who had just received scratches or bruises. This resulted in the figures being ten times as high as those of the previous day. Some users feel that this information ought to be included whereas others do not.

Prominent inclusion of the word 'illegal' is proposed on the basis of the Spanish government position on the matter, and opposed on the basis of the multiple viewpoints. The fact that the Spanish government is opposed to the idea is already mentioned elsewhere in the same paragraph.

Description of specific violent incidents and injuries are disputed, including an injury to an ERC politician which was described differently in different sources. It is also being discussed to what extent footage from previous demonstrations is relevant (apparently presented as being of the current vote) and to which extent this matter deserves its own independent section.

Also, there are often differing descriptions between Spanish, Catalan and international sources.

And there are other problems which arise also.

'''Proposed:''' In [[WP:ADVICEPAGE]] add to the examples, this example: "or guidelines/criteria must be met for information to be included in an article" as displayed here: 

:::''However, in a few cases, projects have wrongly used these pages as a means of asserting ownership over articles within their scope, such as insisting that all articles that interest the project must contain a criticism section or must not contain an infobox, or that a specific type of article can't be linked in navigation templates, '''or guidelines/criteria must be met for information to be included in an article''' and that other editors of the article get no say in this because of a "consensus" within the project. An advice page written by several participants of a project is a "local consensus" that is no more binding on editors than material written by any single individual editor. Any advice page that has not been formally approved by the community through the WP:PROPOSAL process has the actual status of an optional essay.''

'''Reasons:''' I have encountered projects that have set guidelines/criteria for editors to include information in articles, and editors use the guidelines/criteria to reject information, regardless of other editors and regardless of the [[WP:NPOV]] policy. The projects may be trying to minimize what they consider "trivia" or may not realize they are trying to violate WP:NPOV or may think they can override WP:NPOV with a ''"Local Consensus"'' for information the project dislikes.  I think add the additional example will help educate project editors that the advice pages guidelines/criteria are not binding, as explained in the existing "However" paragraph and WP:NPOV cannot be overridden. 

Additional thoughts are welcome.[[User:CuriousMind01|CuriousMind01]] ([[User talk:CuriousMind01|talk]]) 00:13, 9 October 2017 (UTC)}}

[[Talk:Milo Yiannopoulos#2017 11 05 Reversions|On the article's talk page]], editors have expressed concern about whether or not a specific piece of text is [[WP:Synthesis]], off-topic and/or editorial commentary. The '''original piece''' (seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milo_Yiannopoulos&diff=808829762&oldid=808828573 here]) includes text and sources that are and are not about Yiannopoulos. A '''proposal''' has been made to only include the text and sources that are specifically about Yiannopoulos. The proposal has been made because the article includes Yiannopoulos [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milo_Yiannopoulos&oldid=809344772#Alleged_support_for_child_sexual_abuse stating] that he did not endorse [[pedophilia]] and elaborating by commenting on the technical definition of pedophilia, and some commentators charging that he did endorse pedophilia. As a result, it has been argued that we should additionally include commentators stating that his definition of pedophilia is technically correct, but also that the term colloquially equates to adults engaging in sexual activity with minors (or specifically committing child sexual abuse), as this analysis relates to Yiannopoulos's pedophilia and child sexual abuse arguments. So should the material be included? For the original and proposed text, see the collapsible templates below.

 I've been recommended by other editors to start an Rfc for this issue, which originated from this article but is actually much broader in scope. 

As you can probably see in the Description section of this article, as well as that of ''[[Eolambia]]'' (the descriptive text in these two articles is largely my own work; I am sure there are additional examples written by different editors in other articles), anatomical descriptions of dinosaurs can become quite protracted despite the best efforts of editors. 

This is mainly because some dinosaurs - especially newly-named taxa - receive relatively little attention in layman-accessible publications; and also because some of these taxa have few or no "noticeable" distinguishing characteristics which can be communicated generally with no need for jargon.

Opinions of editors belonging to [[WP:DINO]] on this subject, from what I have seen, can be roughly subdivided into two camps (excluding those who have neutral stances): anatomical detail is useful information that should be retained; and anatomical detail is information that can be obtained from the paper, which thus does not need to be repeated in Wikipedia articles. 

I'm curious as to what the wider community of Wikipedia editors might think of this issue. ''[[User:Lythronaxargestes|Lythronaxargestes]]'' ([[User talk:Lythronaxargestes#top|talk]] &#124; [[Special:Contributions/Lythronaxargestes|contribs]]) 23:32, 10 October 2017 (UTC)}}

I've got an OTRS ticket from the subject of this biography, looking to have it re-inserted into the mainspace.  They have noted a number of potential reasons they meet the notability criteria, the most compelling of which in my view is that they are the composer of the official song of the [[Belgian First Division A]].  This is apparently played before every game, and is also frequently used in television broadcasts of the league.  Soccer is not my game (I'm more of a cricket person), so I'm not sure if this would count as a "notable composition" per [[WP:COMPOSER]].  I also welcome opinions on whether there are any other reasons to believe they meet [[WP:N]]; they are certainly prolific but I'm drawing a blank when it comes to the usual sorts of sources we like to see.  Could someone more familiar with the topic material than I have a look and venture an opinion on whether this would be good enough to save this article from immediate deletion if it were moved into mainspace?

{{shortcut|WP:NACDEL}}

In the early days of Wikipedia, admins were conferred with [[Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrators.27_abilities|a number of powers not granted to all editors]].  As a consequence of admins being the only editors who could delete pages, closing deletion discussions was an activity reserved to admins.

At some point, the workload in forums like [[WP:AFD]] grew to the point where the existing cadre of admins could not keep up and the queue of completed, but not yet closed, discussions was growing.  The solution to this was that in 2008, the concept of [[Wikipedia:Non-admin closure|non-admin closure (NAC)]] was adopted.  In a nutshell, the policy said that as long as the outcome was a slam-dunk keep, it was OK for a non-admin to close the discussion.

We are currently at a point where non-admin closures are often being questioned, not because they were bad closes (i.e. would have been overturned even if an admin had done it), but simply because the closer was not an admin and the discussion was not a slam-dunk keep.  Some of the people performing NACs have been active on the project for 10 years or more, have upwards of 10,000 edits to their name, have extensive experience at XfD, and are as conversant with our policies as most admins.

This is a bad situation.  It means we are taking people who are skilled and motivated and telling them that their contributions are unwelcome simply because they do not hold a certification.  One might counter that they should simply become admins, but many people do not want to do that.  I don't fully understand all of their reasons, but at least one reason is obvious; [[WP:RFA]] is as much a hazing ritual as it is an evaluation of somebody's qualifications, which (understandably) turns people off.  Whatever the reason, we have very few people applying for adminship these days.

I propose we split the ability to delete files as a result of a deletion discussion off into a distinct "user right", which can be conferred through a much lighter weight process than standing for adminship.  Admins will still be needed to apply user blocks, protect pages, delete under [[WP:CSD]], [[WP:PROD]], etc.  Anybody with this user right will be able to close any XfD, with the same effect as if they were an admin.

On occasion, XfDs will result in a consensus to perform some action other than a simple deletion of the page under discussion (salt, a rename which requires moving a protected page, etc).  To keep things simple, I propose that the non-admin closer would be able to write up the close decision, and then find an admin to perform the required action.

Obviously, this will require some changes to the MediaWiki software.  I'm a software engineer.  While I only have only a vague familiarity with the MediaWiki codebase, I'm assuming this would not be complicated to implement.  We need some way to identify eligible pages, and a check in the deletion codepath for both the user and the page meeting the right criteria.  And something in the U/I to render the appropriate button/link.

The sorting of subcategories in this category is inconsistent.  What should be done with it?

Two sorting types are used in here at present:

* Alphabetically by subcategory base name (e.g. [[:Category:ICC World Twenty20]] is sorted under "I" for "ICC" instead of "C" for "Cricket").
Additionally, someone has been adding sortkeys to some subcats (e.g. "+Cue sports" to [[:Category:Cue sports world championships]]) to create a separate list above the A–Z listing, by sport.

Above all of that are some "*" sorts to put a few overarching entries at the top, e.g. [[:Category:Women's world championships]], which seems fine. <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''']] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] &gt;<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>&lt; </span> 22:52, 13 October 2017 (UTC)}}

I have attempted to edit this article towards what I understand to be the style prescribed by [[WP:MOSNUM]].

However, these edits have been disputed by other editors, as can be seen on the talk page above.

Hello, and welcome to this RfC concerning guidelines as to when a !vote in a requests for adminship discussion should be removed.

This RfC has been caused by controversy surrounding a vote being [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Megalibrarygirl&diff=805041091&oldid=805040441 struck], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Megalibrarygirl&diff=805044170&oldid=805043778 unstruck], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Megalibrarygirl&diff=805056779&oldid=805053701 struck again], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Megalibrarygirl&diff=805062940&oldid=805062655 unstruck for a second time], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Megalibrarygirl&diff=prev&oldid=805077221 struck for a third time], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Megalibrarygirl&diff=805077815&oldid=805077325 unstruck for a third time], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Megalibrarygirl&diff=805087772&oldid=805086527 struck for a fourth time], and then finally [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Megalibrarygirl&diff=805095191&oldid=805094087 unstruck], with instructions from {{u|Cyberpower678}} to not strike the vote again, and the dissent relating to the vote [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Megalibrarygirl&diff=next&oldid=805096116 moved to the talk page].

I do not want to set the agenda -- that, friends, is up to you -- but the vote in question was not vandalism, and was not ''directly'' insulting {{u|Megalibrarygirl}}. Therefore, the RfC below is to establish clear guidance concerning removal of votes before the final count, and preventing incidents like above.

In addition, a similar incident occurred in the same RfA concerning questions, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Megalibrarygirl&diff=805154757&oldid=805154285], thus the RfC will establish the same as above but for questions. A [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Megalibrarygirl&diff=804648468&oldid=804648419 previous question] by the same editor who wrote the oppose vote above was also [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Megalibrarygirl&diff=804685324&oldid=804683715 struck] by {{u|Drmies}}. Both were answered anyway by the candidate.

Although not the same thing entirely, {{u|Paulmcdonald}}'s [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/TonyBallioni#Oppose|oppose]] in {{u|TonyBallioni}}'s RfA received heavy criticism from various editors, to the point where he felt pressured to move to the [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/TonyBallioni#Neutral|neutral]] section. As a result, I have extended this RfC to include discussion of whether threaded discussion of !votes should be allowed.

I said on the discussion on [[WT:RFA]] that this sort of oppose-hounding is new, but I am wrong, see this RFA from two years ago -- [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Wbm1058]] with {{u|GregJackP}}'s notorious oppose (see also the discussion at [[Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Wbm1058#GregJackP]] that was moved there).

For many years, al-Khwarizmi is said to be Persian in the first sentence of the lead. For many years also, there are lengthy discussions in this talk page about his ethnicity. It appears that the only fact that is really known about this is the part "al-Khwarizmi" of his Arabic name. On the other hand, al-Khwarizmi lived and worked in [[Baghdad]], and all his known writings are written in Arabic. Thus, whichever was his ethnicity, al-Khwarizmi was an Arabic scholar. Thus presenting al-Khwarizmi as Persian in the lead is "stating seriously contested assertions as facts" (see [[WP:YESPOV]]), and breaks Wikipedia policy of neutral point of view. By [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi&diff=803907742&oldid=803898752 this edit], I have tempted to fix this; my edit has been reverted, although it has been supported by two other editors, and this led to a week of full protection of the article.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should MoS clarify that capitalized eponyms do not lose their capitalization when used adjectivally?  The test case for this is the very long-running dispute about using "[[Gram stain]]" but "[[gram-negative]]" (i.e. negative in a Gram stain test) when both of these are eponymous (of [[Hans Christian Gram]]) and refer to exactly the same dye-staining process in microscopy. (It has nothing to do with the metric unit [[Gram|gram/gramme]].) The rationale offered for the inconsistency has been that some medical publishers/organizations (like the US [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]], and some medical dictionaries) like to lower-case eponyms in adjectival usage, a rule that WP's Manual of Style (and most other style guides) do not have.  Doing that would require a special exemption to [[MOS:ARTCON]], the overriding consistency guideline of MoS. Use of lower-case "gram-negative" style is not consistent in reliable sources in bacteriology, medicine, histology, microscopy, and related fields.  It's purely a [[house style]] choice (as our own articles indicate, with sources).

<small>This RfC does not address cases where an eponym's connection to its namesake has been effectively severed and the meaning has shifted (e.g., we would continue to capitalize in constructions like [[Platonic solid]], [[Platonic love]], and the [[Draconian constitution]] of Athens, but permit lowercase for figural usage like "His relationship with his roommate was platonic", "She said her parents' rules were draconian", though in encyclopedic writing we'd be better off avoiding such wording).  Lower-case is also used in various other cases when virtually all sources agree on lower case ([[eustachian tube]], [[Cesarean section|caesarian or cesarean section]]), again due to loss of a clear connection to the namesake in the public mind (contrast [[degree Celsius]] and other units, [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and other diseases, [[Newtonian mechanics]] and other scientific principles, etc.)</small>

Hello all-
Suggest we eliminate the redundant "This edit"/"This is" language from the descriptions of the edit types. To my eye, the current legend reads a bit children's book-ish. I tried to get at the code that generates the legend, but can't find it.

I would change this:

{{quote frame|
Legend (help):<br>
'''r''' This edit may have problems and should be reviewed (more info)<br>
'''N''' This edit created a new page<br>
'''m''' This is a minor edit<br>
'''b''' This edit was made by a bot<br>
'''D''' This edit was made at Wikidata
}}

to this:

{{quote frame|

'''r''' Edit should be '''r'''eviewed for problems (more info) [or maybe simply: Edit marked for '''r'''eview (more info)]<br>
'''N''' '''N'''ew page<br>

I can't believe we have to start a discussion about this, but here it goes. The following statement in the introduction: <blockquote>'Raiders of the Lost Ark is often ranked as one of the greatest films of all time, both in the action-adventure genre, and in general. The film also ranks #2 on Empire's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.'</blockquote> is completely ridiculous. The fact that an average film magazine with no authority at all is calling ROTLA one of the greatest (action)-films of all time, doesn't mean a statement like the above is justified. At best you could say: 'Empire Magazine called ROTLA...'. Also the sources are highly dubious. At least two of the three sources are referring specifically to action films, so a statement that includes 'often considered' and 'in general' is already highly inappropriate. Can we get rid of this POV nonsense? Or do the fanboys want an extensive discussion? [[User:Wim Kostrowicki|Wim Kostrowicki]] ([[User talk:Wim Kostrowicki|talk]]) 14:44, 19 October 2017 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
When categorizing articles about past ''political and military events'', we tend to categorize them (only) in the tree of the country that existed in the past during the event. For example the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] took place in the former Austrian Empire and the battle field is currently in the Czech Republic. For categorization it means that the article is in [[:Category:1805 in the Austrian Empire]] but not in the tree of the Czech Republic.

However, when it concerns ''non-political events'', e.g. establishments of buildings and structures, the existing categorization practice is a bit different, then many articles are categorized by current country rather than by past country. For example [[Andechs (restaurant)]] is in [[:Category:15th-century establishments in Germany]] but not in the tree of [[:Category:Duchy of Bavaria]]. 

Should we keep the two different existing categorization principles next to each other, or should we enforce that all goes into past country categories only? (I'm assuming that all into current country categories is definitely not an option.) [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 13:50, 20 October 2017 (UTC)}}

The [[Social Progress Index]] cover a lot of information about social progress, which includes a range of relevant parameters about health, education, jobs, violence, etc. It's a very complete and reputable ranking (and – only an opinion - more relevant than the HDI ahd GPD, for example). Futhermore, there is no information in the infobox about these social issues. Therefore, I think this index should be added in the infobox of the countries.

Hi and thanks to everyone for contributing :-)  The word ''limes'' meant the boundary between two fields.  It came to be used to refer to paths, a typical feature of such a boundary and other passages, like roads.  It would appear that it's sometimes been erroneously defined as "fortifications" such as were common on the frontiers of the empire ([http://www.constantinethegreatcoins.com/articles/Isaac_The_Meaning_of_the_Terms_Limes_and_Limitanei.pdf See "Conclusions" section (pg.146)], and [http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/1989/077pdf/077287.pdf this article] in support of Isaac's position).

The ''Limes'' article leads with the false definition.  The ''Etymology and sentiment'' (?) section is a disaster.  There are also various categories that likewise make the same mistake.

Suggestions? <br>

It appears to be traditional that Governors General of Canada, and possibly other similar democracies, confer titles on the subject of "Her Excellency the Right Honourable" (or "His" for male subjects). Prior to that, the subject is known by an honorific title. For males, it is usually, "Mr." although some have also been "Dr." For married females, it is usually, "Mrs." [http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/astronauts/canadian/former/bio-julie-payette.asp We have a reference], that refers to the subject as "Ms. Payette".

Discussion is necessary over whether to keep this as a redirect and, if so, where to redirect. I note that the most common use of this term is as a ''slogan'' and we have a paragraph at [[white nationalism#United States]] that explains its origins. It is currently a redirect to [[white pride]] which is, as an article, well-developed with decent sourcing, but I find, actually, more sources discussing the "white power" slogan. Other options include writing an entirely new article, writing a new section in a current article, or simply keeping the status quo. Note the preliminary discussion on this matter which has already taken place at [[Talk:White_pride#White power]]. Broader input would be welcome.

The article contains phrases such as "In Scandinavia, intellectuals were also searching for their authentic Teutonic roots" and "This law also marks a shift in our national awareness; it gives voice to the national understanding that diversity within the country is a unifying feature, not something that separates us." Is this OK? [[User:Bloodofox|&#58;bloodofox:]] ([[User talk:Bloodofox|talk]]) 04:38, 23 October 2017 (UTC)}}

I am proposing a guideline, that using what I call a "Top Down Approach", if a song is notable, if the tune is an original composition by an artist, and the album that contains that song is the first album, and/or the only album to contain that song, that the album should probably be notable.  I ran into this with "[[Makin' This Boy Go Crazy]]", whose history used to be an album article before being deleted at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Makin' This Boy Go Crazy|AFD]].  An album is a collection of songs, and if the songs are extensively reviewed, the album is essentially being reviewed.<br>
Similarly, if an album by an artist is notable, the artist probably should also be notable, as the article can discuss the albums, and potentially the songs.  This "Top Down Approach" can be applied to large companies, and other entities as well.  I appreciate your thoughts on this matter.

Should the operation of Treblinka gas chambers include the description of the type of fuel used to produce deadly fumes? Some historians say, it was the gasoline (i.e. petrol), other historians say it was the diesel fuel. The controversy goes back several decades. — The SS functionary who installed the fuming engines at the extermination camps of Operation Reinhard (including Treblinka); and, who testified at the postwar trials in Germany, did not describe his own Treblinka installation. Others did it instead of him ... thus igniting a fiery debate in the following decades between Holocaust historians, Holocaust deniers, and even the most prominent American politicians.

The heart of this document, is that people with a COI should disclose it, and should put proposed edits to mainspace through prior review instead of making them directly (in other words, put drafts through AfC for new articles, and for existing articles, make proposals on the talk page).  The document mentions that per our [[WP:PAID|paid-contribution disclosure policy]] and the ToU, paid editors must disclose.  The document includes the common sense notion that conflicted and paid editors can directly make noncontroversial edits in mainspace like removing vandalism, and it accommodates GLAM/WIR editors in a common sense way.   
The document makes it clear that [[WP:HA|the policy against harassment]] takes precedence over it, and that OUTING is strictly enforced.
It has been a long time since we assessed the status of this document.  The question here is: is this "policy" or "guideline" '''in the community'''?  I am asking about what we normally expect from each other, what we actually do and say as we work, the kinds of arguments that people actually make on noticeboards, etc. [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]] ([[User talk:Jytdog|talk]]) 16:37, 26 November 2017 (UTC)}}

Proposal:
A link to Wikinews should be on the main page, perhaps in the "In the news" section.

Rationale:
A recent RfC on [[WP:NOTNEWS]] stated that the policy should be loosened because "Wikinews is dead". Regardless of the outcome of that RfC, I believe that Wikinews' problem is the lack of outside readership, and therefore editors. A more prominent location on Wikipedia's homepage would likely do wonders for the traffic to Wikinews, which is likely the only viable solution for its lack of readership and contributors.

As I put it in the Idea Lab, which I posted when I was more awake and by extension a lot more convincing:
<blockquote>
The rationale is "Wikinews is dead". You know, sure. It's not the most popular WMF project - not by a long shot. However, the problem is mainly that:

# No one seems to know it exists (except the more active Wikipedians)
# Not many non-editors go there
# No one seems to know it exists (again, I know, but no one does)

I know Wikinews is ''technically'' on the main page by the other WMF pet projects, but a link in ''In the news'' will be more beneficial to WN.
</blockquote>

As I've been slowly converting the thousands of United States electoral maps currently in .jpeg/.png format to .svg, I've been coming across many inconsistencies, even with maps made in 2016. For example, when comparing 2016 presidential election maps to 2016 senate election maps, an entirely different color scheme is being used, as well as a lack of color keys.

Should we streamline our electoral map making template for the United States to include all relevant elections (President, Senate, and any other state-wide election)? If a different map is better suited, then of course use that, this is just to streamline the process.

Should algorithms for converting between Julian Day and calendar date be written in a way that may be misinterpreted or which may lead to wrong results? (See discussion in Section [[#Reversion]].) Basic'ly we agree that a couple of algorithms will work correctly if one "rounds" certain quotients toward minus infinity whether they are positive or negative, but the person whom we cite for the algorithms didn't say that, so the other editor wants us to say that the algorithms are only good for positive Julian Day. We also disagree about whether to write one of the algorithms in a simple way, or using a table of constants instead.

Someone's put the following into [[Wikipedia:Categorization of people]]:

{{talk quote|1=Some people are known primarily by their first name only. When it is not possible to set the first name alone as the article title, as with many articles in Category:Brazilian footballers, you should sort with the first name first to make the article easier to find in the categories. For example, Leonardo Araújo is commonly known as Leonardo, and should be sorted as <code><nowiki>{{DEFAULTSORT:Leonardo Araujo}}</nowiki></code>.}}

'''It is proposed to replace this much clearer, narrower wording''' that does not have the [[WP:CONLEVEL]] policy problem of carving out a strange exemption for a single wikiproject:

{{talk quote|1=Some people are known primarily by their first name (or a stage name) only. If an article's title is at that single name – alone, as in the case of [[Pelé]], or disambiguated, as in the case of [[Pink (singer)]] – then do not use <code>DEFAULTSORT</code> at all; the article will automatically sort by the article title. If the article is at a full name (at least one given name and family name), sort normally in <code><var>familyname, given name</var></code> order.  (Be aware that some cultures use family name first in natural language, so do not blindly assume that the last part of a subject's name is the family name); examples: <code><nowiki>{{DEFAULTSORT:Araujo, Leonardo}}</nowiki></code> [[Leonardo Araujo]] (often called simply Leonardo), and <code><nowiki>{{DEFAULTSORT:Utada, Hikaru}}</nowiki></code> for [[Utada Hikaru]] (often known as Utada).}}

The parenthetical about family name order could be put into a footnote.

As it isn't about the article per se, someone may wish to suggest a more appropriate venue. Regardless, I want it held neutral ground, rather than [[User talk:AlexTheWhovian|the talk page of the person I'm in dispute with]]).''

'''tl;dr version - Hatnote keeps being cut down because "(TV series)" qualifier in the article's title supposedly renders most of it unnecessary. However, the hatnote in question is a {{tl|redirect}} one, and it's the unqualified redirected term [[Wentworth Prison]] that's being disambiguated, not the article title.''' 

To cut a long story short, I came across this page and noticed [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wentworth_(TV_series)&diff=prev&oldid=757924533 a hatnote I remembered adding to] had been cut down.

A quick search of the history showed [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wentworth_(TV_series)&diff=prev&oldid=780959060 this edit]. No explanation or justification for what appeared to be removal of legitimate content and degradation of functionality. So, I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlexTheWhovian&type=revision&diff=812195233&oldid=812115370 left a message on the talk page of the editor (AlexTheWhovian)] and restored the full hatnote.

This was subsequently reverted by Alex with "''Unnecessary mass disambiguation when this page is already disambiguated as "(TV series)" - if there needs to be a disambiguation page, create one and don't use this page for that purpose.''"

Yes- I *am* well aware that for pages with qualifiers in the title, the ''main'' dab- if needed at all- should only include items at risk of confusion with that specific case. '''However, that's ''not'' what was being disambiguated! The {{tl|redirect}} template makes perfectly clear that it refers to a ''redirected'' term- [[Wentworth Prison]]- which in this case *wasn't qualified at all''', i.e.:-
: '''''"[[Wentworth Prison]]" redirects here.''''' For Wentworth Detention Centre in the related series "Prisoner" [etc]...
I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wentworth_%28TV_series%29&type=revision&diff=812250424&oldid=812240168 restored the full hatnote] including the explanation that "''as clearly indicated, the hatnote is for the *redirected* term "Wentworth Prison". It will be noted that this is *not* qualified as a "TV series".''"

Alex's response? He undid the restoration (again) simply stating that "''The disputed content has been removed, so you need to either gain WP:CONSENSUS or create a valid disambiguation page.''"

No acknowledgement of the point made (whether or not he agrees with it). Instead of defending his argument, we simply get something that comes across (to me) as a dubious attempt to invoke [[WP:CONSENSUS|our consensus guidelines]] as a tool for [[Wikipedia:Wikilawyering|Wikilawyering]].

I don't think this is a "consensus" issue- it seems fairly straightforward- but I don't intend wasting time with an edit war, so I'd appreciate some third party feedback on this anyway. [[User:Ubcule|Ubcule]] ([[User talk:Ubcule|talk]]) 22:41, 27 November 2017 (UTC)}}

'''Are elections described as decided before the result is certified?'''
Should we say in [[WP:WikiVoice|Wikipedia's voice]] that an election outcome is decided, and say in infoboxes such as {{tl|Infobox election}}, {{tl|Infobox officeholder}} that a candidate is the winner, and is now an incoming officeholder (with a future start date), calling them &lt;office&gt;[[-elect]], based on major media calling the race using projections from preliminary returns, before the final vote tally and certification of the result? Do we base this only on major media annoucing a winner, or is this article content influenced by whether the presumed losing candidate has conceded or not? And is this article content influenced by our own calculations such as the mathematical probability of overcoming a deficit in the uncounted ballots?

Alternatively, do we only say, in prose using [[WP:INTEXT|in-text attribution]], in the article body ''not'' in infoboxes: ''"CNN, the NYT, and WGBH have called the race for candidate X, and they predict that the uncounted ballots are insufficient to overcome their lead over candidate Y"'' and ''"Candidate Y has/has not conceded"''? 

Does this reasoning also apply to sports contests or other outcomes where it is widely agreed by reliable sources that it has been decided, but there is some time delay before an official result is verified and announced, or does this apply only to elections? --[[User:Dennis Bratland|Dennis Bratland]] ([[User talk:Dennis Bratland|talk]]) 04:57, 9 November 2017 (UTC)}}

Recently two parallel RfC were concluded - one at the [[Talk:Syrian_Civil_War/Archive_45#RfC|Talk:Syrian Civil War]] page and another one on this page above. While the long standing consensus has been not to regard to Israel as a belligerent or supporter (see [[talk:Syrian Civil War/Israel]]), several editors advocated that certain articles on the Syrian Civil War could include Israel and this page now lists Israel as "supporting the opposition". However, it is very confusing due to conflicting claims - Israelis have repeatedly refuted of supporting the Syrian opposition; the only party that Israelis [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria/israeli-military-says-ready-to-protect-druze-village-in-syria-idUSKBN1D3173 vowed to protect] in Syrian territories were the [[Druze]] who are mostly pro-Ba'athist (pro-Asad). Some conspiracy theories have also advocated Israeli alleged support to ISIL or to Al-Nusra Front (also refuted by Israelis) and Israeli Air Force has periodically been accused of airstrikes on Syrian territories (Israelis mostly denied or ignored). Israelis themselves admitted of being involved in some spillover border incidents and so far responded in fire against several Syrian War parties ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-syria-idUSKBN19J2RS against SAA] and [http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-israel-syria-idUSKCN0QQ0NH20150821 pro-Asad PIJ], [http://www.timesofisrael.com/free-syrian-army-accuses-israel-of-aiding-assad/ against FSA], [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/27/world/middleeast/israeli-military-kills-4-isis-linked-militants-in-golan-heights.html?mcubz=0 against ISIL]), which is however very limited. Surely Israel cannot be listed as supporting all parties or fighting against all parties of that war, so this RfC should bring some order on this page considering that Israel is not included in the Syrian Civil War infobox and main page. 

Please vote which option for listing Israel on this page is preferable if any:

[[Talk:Milo Yiannopoulos#2017 11 05 Reversions|On the article's talk page]], there was concern about whether or not the text seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milo_Yiannopoulos&diff=808829762&oldid=808828573 here] was [[WP:Synthesis]].

Below is the proposed content:

'''Proposed content'''

{{rfcquote|text=
There was a discussion above related to [[WP:BLP]] and one of the contributors suggested an RFC. The general question raised was whether it is appropriate to mention the subject's original name, which was used during much of their adult life, etc. There were concerns raised about disrespecting the subject's life choices. So my question to the wider community is

:Regarding basic details about the subject's former identity, details that are covered by the mainstream media ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/danica-roem-a-policy-wonk-in-a-rainbow-headscarf-trying-to-make-history/2017/10/19/93a0bf00-9e2a-11e7-8ea1-ed975285475e_story.html?utm_term=.7c7bcf7d75ca], [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/us/virginia-legislature-election-trump-.html]), is it appropriate to deliberately exclude such details out of concern that it may offend the subject's sensibilities?

Obviously this has wider implications beyond this article.

Should national anthems be considered a special case of [[WP:FU|Fair Use]]?

Based on recent edit wars on articles pertaining (primarily) to Central Asian national anthems, it seems that the long-standing <code><nowiki>{{citation needed}}</nowiki></code> tag on this page regarding such anthems needs to be properly resolved. Previous discussions have taken place [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Media_copyright_questions/Archive/2015/July#National_anthems.2C_a_special_case_of_fair_use here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Non-free_content/Archive_64#National_anthems.2C_a_special_case_of_fair_use here], but participation was low and no consensus seems to have been reached. I am therefore opening a RFC to try an develop a consensus as to whether or not the lyrics of national anthems should be treated as a special case of Fair Use on Wikipedia.

How much "history" should be included in the Lead Section of a modern country's article? How much is too much and how much is too little? For example, [[Finland]]'s history represents about half the lead, [[Canada]]'s represents about a third, [[Switzerland]]'s is less than a quarter, whereas [[Federated States of Micronesia]] has almost none at all. 

A subquestion, for anyone really interested, is what is the appropriate balance between pre-modern and modern history in the lead.

{{rfcquote|text=
In responding to an edit template-protected request (temporarily declined), the question has come up whether to remove transit system icons entirely from station (and perhaps similar) navigational templates, or to preserve them along with plain wording; clearly the icons alone are not sufficient even with <code>alt</code> text because the words in many of them (when they even contain words) are not alway legible in icon size.

I.e., '''the question is whether to remove the icons like the one shown in front of "London Underground" in this example''':
{{S-start|noclear=yes}}
{{s-rail|title=LUL}}
{{s-line|system=LUL|line=Bakerloo|previous=Edgware Road|next=Baker Street}}
{{S-end}}

I declined the request at least initially because an argument can be made that the icons are helpful to a subset of editors (each is recognizable instantly to anyone familiar with the transit system in question) and thus are not purely decorative; these icons do not raise the socio-political and [[WP:UNDUE]] issues that overuse and misuse of flag icons do; and we're more tolerant of such images in nav templates than elsewhere. On the other hand, the icons are surely not {{em|necessary}}, and it's not clear how helpful they are nor to what percentage of readers. I remain neutral on the question; this is a procedural nomination so template editors know what to do. <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''']] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] &gt;<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>&lt; </span> 18:32, 18 November 2017 (UTC)}}

:2) Is it possible to add the membership estimates to the intro, even if the organization itself does not publish its membership figures?
:3) Is a 1973 US military chaplain's manual on the Church of Satan a reliable source for Wikipedia?
:4) Editor Seanbonner added the following to the article: "as memberships are for a lifetime membership numbers would grow year after year." He didn't give a source for this and claims one is not needed, as it is, in the editor's opinion, "simple addition". I believe this is a non sequitur statement. What do other editors think?

{{rfcquote|text=
Hello I am new to Wikipedia. I wish to conduct a small project to clean up and create some consistency in the opening paragraph of every area of London. I have noticed recently that there has been some activity, not all of it good, amongst editors on how this should be written. After reading through many of the area pages, and the discussions that have arisen from them etc. I have come to the conclusion that they should begin like so:

A is an area of B London, England, within the London Borough(s) of C (and D). It is located E miles F of Charing Cross. It lies within the Historic County of G... and so on.

Where: A is the area name, B is the compass direction from Central London (or "Central London" if the area is located there), C is the borough it is located within (D is only used if it straddles borough boundaries), E is the distance in miles from Charing Cross, and F is the direction, G is the Historic County the area was within before either of the London boundary changes.

What do people think of this? Do I have to have some kind of admin permission before I commence? Thank you. [[User:Huskion|Huskion]] ([[User talk:Huskion|talk]]) 15:06, 21 November 2017 (UTC)}}

 Very recently, [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] (Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) was lambasted in the major news media for the reprimand it gave a Teaching Assistant for showing a video of a TV current affairs program. It was a controversial topic: [[Gender-neutral pronoun]] (e.g. "they" vs. "he or she").

The TA was accused by the professors of "being transphobic and liken her failure to condemn Peterson to remaining neutral on the views of Adolf Hitler." https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/11/21/laurier-apologizes-to-teaching-assistant-who-aired-clip-of-gender-pronoun-debate.html After the recording of the reprimand meeting was released to the media, the University President and prof wrote an open apology to the TA. Both letters were widely covered by the major news media.  (''Criticism of the university has been intense and relentless across Canada.'' https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7936187-wlu-apologizes-for-treatment-of-graduate-student/)

While I have not been / am not a paid-editor, I would like to invite the community's opinions on exploring the following issue:

*Should/should not we include some line in the current policy, which captures ''past'' paid-editing activities; for example, by adding to the current policy:

On the [[WP:FRNG]] page, it is stated that a Wikipedia article should not make a fringe theory appear more notable or more widely accepted than it is.  Likewise, they should be represented in proportion to their prominence.  So, should the Fringe Theories section be reduced in the article [[New Albion]]?

Thanks for coming here. There is currently some dubious claims which are not verifiable per [[WP:V]] but people are using them to define notability. One claim is that he is in "Top 100 entrepreneurs under the age of 30" list of the United Nations. He don't has his name in notable [[ICC Cricket Hall of Fame|Cricket Hall of Fame]]. Also, many of sources mention him which comes under name-checking adding nothing significant to pass [[WP:GNG]].

Currently, the "Future" section includes a subsection for "potential projects". Two of the projects listed (Runaways & Inhumans) have been developed as television shows. There is disagreement about how the material should be presented, which can be reviewed in the section directly above. These are the proposed ideas:
*'''Option 1''' - Delete the material completely, proposed by [[User:DisneyMetalhead]]. This was opposed because they ''were'' potential projects, and omitting the material makes the article incomplete.
*'''Option 2''' - Leave them as-is since no reliable source has said the television programs mean the films are cancelled, proposed by [[User:Favre1fan93]]. Opposed because their development into television series means they are not potential MCU projects, they are actual MCU projects.
*'''Option 3''' - Move those two entries to a new section titled "Canceled projects", "Shelved projects", "Repurposed projects", or another accurate description, proposed by [[User:Argento Surfer]]. Opposed because no reliable source has confirmed they are actually cancelled. (Runaways was described as "shelved" before being mentioned as something that comes up in "television and film discussions"
*'''Option 4''' - Move "Potential projects" to a level two heading, and give each potential project a level three heading, proposed by [[User:Argento Surfer]]. Opposed because this would put the potential films on the same level as actual films.

Should a BLP conclusively state that the person is a "fraud" absent criminal wrongdoing?

There have been repeated edits and reverts to a definitive statement in the Lead that the subject "is a fraud"‎. This continues despite previous discussion on this Talk page for the last 10&nbsp;years. See, for example, these diffs by [[User:CaptainPedge]]:
[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Popoff&type=revision&diff=812921650&oldid=812876386],‎

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Popoff&diff=next&oldid=789926044]. This seems to be unencyclopedic in tone and a BLP violation. The article (including the Lead)‎ correctly and repeatedly cites with attribution that so-and-so has debunked his fraudulent claims, thereby allowing the reader to form their own conclusion. But to state as a fact that the person is a fraud smacks of blatant pov.‎ Unlike [[Bernie Madoff]] or [[Jim Bakker]], Popoff has not been criminally charged, much less convicted, of fraud. This must be the standard applied in the case of a BLP. <i><b><small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User:JGHowes|<font style="color:white;background:#008000;">&nbsp;JGHowes&nbsp; </font>]]</span></small><font color="blue"> <sup>[[User talk:JGHowes|''talk'']]</sup></font></b></i> 03:18, 1 December 2017 (UTC)}}

[[:Sarah Huckabee Sanders]] → {{no redirect|Sarah Sanders}} – Per [[WP:COMMONNAME]]. Both her official and personal Twitter accounts refer to her as Sarah Sanders, as well as the official White House website. In addition, a variety of media sites [http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/11/politics/sarah-sanders-press-briefing-analysis/index.html CNN][http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/11/sarah-sanders-shuts-down-cnn-star-jim-acostas-grandstanding.html Fox][http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/male-reporter-asks-sarah-sanders-during-white-house-briefing-to-say-whether-shes-faced-sexual-harassment/article/2643178 Washington Examiner][https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2017/12/11/here-how-sarah-sanders-defended-trump-against-accusations-misconduct/FRGMNLOS6oe0pUCx8VspgK/story.html The Boston Globe], among others, refer to her as simply Sarah Sanders and not as Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Look at the recent [[Hillary Clinton]] request move as an example of why Sarah Huckabee Sanders should be moved to Sarah Sanders.
