I\'m particularly concerned with the first case. Editors may differ on the second case.

And if so that\'s a valid point. And some people just like things tidy and there\'s nothing wrong with that. And there might be other virtues for the reader or editors of one-entry categories that I haven\'t thought of.

For example a reason given that part of the denial is I was overeager, for fucks sake I asked two people almost two weeks a part in early march about clerking one didn\'t have experience and the other wasn\'t taking a trainee and then didn\'t comment on the issue again until there was a thread comment in June by someone else suggesting a need for more clerks. I\'m going to be very honest that really hurt my feelings (wah I know), we are all volunteers here and want to help, to say that\'s the reason why we don\'t want you is beyond petty and it\'s hurtful. Ok boo hoo that aside, if we have open discussionas about admin, arbs, crats maybe we should expand this to encompass clerks, I\'m disturbed to hear such personal judgements that I doubt would be expressed if it was an open forum discussed in front of everyone. Another editor pointed out on my page that it is a contradiction that clerks and cu are supposed to be open about their dealings and this should be no different I agree, for good or worse we don\'t protect the good RFA\'s from the bad ones, and those open forums can do a lot to give direction to areas that people are excelling in or lacking in.
