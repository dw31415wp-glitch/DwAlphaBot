Prominent, reliable sources give both 1969 and 1970 as birth years for Mariah Carey. How should this be addressed?


* '''Comment'''  The only source for Mariah's Carey birth year that cites actual, physical documentation is [[Time Inc.]]'s ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine, a highly [[WP:RS|reliable source]], which says [http://www.nndb.com/people/115/000023046/#FN1 here]:
{{quote|"[W]e have a copy of Ms. Carey's driver's license, which lists her birthday as March 27, 1969. Furthermore, we spoke with the administrators at the high school she attended who confirmed that Ms. Carey's birthday is March 27, 1969, as did her management when we made our initial interview."}}
Carey herself, in her U.S. Copyright registration, also gives 1969 [http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&ti=1,1&Search_Arg=Mariah%20Carey&Search_Code=TALL&CNT=25&PID=AkB0SNBj680EIAiGvc53x9JVOTXmi&SEQ=20130809091350&SID=2 here].

{{rfcquote|text=
[[Wikipedia:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] is the new interface that people currently get if they click on the "edit <small>beta</small>" button at the top of an article. The word "beta" means it is new software which still has some [[software bug|bugs]] in it. VisualEditor (VE) is an attempt to provide a really easy "[[WYSIWYG|what you see is what you get]]" interface, which does not require any knowledge of [[markup language]]. Markup language is a simple kind of [[source code|computer code]] that Wikipedia editors have been using to edit since 2001. Editors who do not wish to use Visual Editor and who prefer to work using the markup language use the "edit source" button instead.

WMF has now provided a preference that allows individual editors to disable [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]]. This preference currently defaults to enabling the software, meaning that any new editor is exposed to VisualEditor, although that editor is not warned in advance that the editor is in beta test and may damage the article or behave in unexpected ways. Similarly, the option of using VE is presented to editors who are not logged in, although those editors are not warned in advance that the editor is in beta test and may damage the article or behave in unexpected ways.

This RFC ([[Wikipedia:Request for Comment|Request For Comment]]) is intended to seek English Wikipedia's consensus on whether this is the correct behaviour for this preference. It is true that the WMF is not bound by this consensus, but they have shown a willingness to respect the decision for both the Dutch and German Wikipedias, both of which have persuaded WMF to default to disabling VE until an editor changes his preference, making it an "opt-in" preference.

This RFC is structured around a few simple questions. It is ''not'' a vehicle for insulting WMF, nor is it a vehicle for venting any frustrations about VisualEditor. The options are purposely ''not'' mutually exclusive: it would be quite possible, for example, to favor leaving the switch unchanged for existing editors while making it default to "disable" for any new accounts. Similarly, one could believe that it is legitimate to leave VE enabled for anonymous editors and also favor changing the user interface to clearly indicate that VE is in beta.

I think saying that Jainism is a ''religious reform'' movement is POV-pushing. While the evidence for Jainism to have been existed in Indus Valley Civilization and the existence of Rishabha in vedic literature is scanty, it has nevertheless been speculated by a good number of scholars. {{harv|Chapple|1993|pp=6–9}}{{harv|Sangave|2001|p=107}}{{harv|Rankin|2010|p=44}}{{harv|Sangave|2001|p=106}} It is known that the origins of Jainism are shrouded in considerable mystery. Scholars now accept that '''Mahavira, the twenty-fourth tirthankara, was certainly not the founder of Jainism''' and '''Parshva, the twenty-third tirthankara was a historical figure'''.{{harv|Glasenapp|1999|p=24}} Considering these, I don't think it would be correct to say that Jainism was a reform movement.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=High-speed_rail&diff=571562845&oldid=571561704 This diff] keeps getting reverted and re-added. The point of dispute is the claim that "China has the fastest railways on the world", where the referenced [[Railway Gazette]] uses the timetable and the distance of 248 km between two station to calculate service speed. [[User:FlyAkwa]] has referenced [[Google Maps]] to falsify that distance and claims it is more like 205  km [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Leiyang_-_Shaoguan.png see his image] and it has been independently done by [[User:Z22|Z22]], which would then yield a lower service speed based on the timetable speed between the two stations in question.
''' Survey === 
* '''Support''' If the [[Railway Gazette]] is considered the foremost authority on railways, the paragraph should stay.
* '''Oppose''' If [[Google Maps]] is considered a more reliable source on geography than [[Railway Gazette]], then the RG is considered to have made a mistake on this occasion (but is otherwise still considered an [[WP:RS]] and the paragraph should be deleted.

''' Threaded discussion '''

* '''Comment''': More background on this can be seen in [[Talk:High-speed_rail#A_recurrent_problem|this discussion]]. 
: Another sentence in question beside the "fastest railways on the world" is that whether we should include in the article that "... new high-speed railways have been built in China, and speeds have increased." I made a comment in that discussed that the source does not talk about the operating speeds but rather the design top speeds of 350 km/h which are usually higher than the operating speeds. And also the design speeds for trains prior to that accident already reached 350 km/h anyway. So newer high-speed railways haven't increased the design speeds in China. Because that sentence is misleading, I suggested in the discussion that the sentence should be removed. [[User:Z22|Z22]] ([[User talk:Z22|talk]]) 02:59, 6 September 2013 (UTC)}}

Should this article's lead state clearly that Israel possesses nuclear weapons? 

At the moment this is stated more ambigously as, "Israel is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons". The official policy of the state of Israel is to neither confirm or deny that the statement is true. However, it is perfectly clear from the cited sources that Isreal does in fact possess these weapons. There does not appear to be any credible sources which deny this statement. To retain the qualifier, "widely believed" appears to be giving undue weight to the official position of the state of Isreal, which is only one source. Furthermore, the state of Israel does not deny the fact, it simply does not confirm it. Many other reliable sources referenced in the article do confirm the statement positively. There is a vast array of evidence to back the statement up in its less ambiguous form. [[User:Thom2002|Thom2002]] ([[User talk:Thom2002|talk]]) 21:25, 11 August 2013 (UTC)}}

{{rfcquote|text=
An administrator has stated that I should begin a request for comment (as in [[User talk:Arthur Rubin#121.58.224.85 disruptive editing bot program please block him immeditately|here]]).

The following is a request for comment on a proposal to have year-in articles henceforth add reader useful links within "monthly" section headings with respect to [[WP:Manual of Style#Section headings|WP:MOS]].

[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style]] states in subsection [[WP:Manual of Style#Section headings|Section headings]] that, "Headings should not ''normally'' contain links.

I have italized the word "normally" because I believe that I have discovered an instance where a section heading should have a link. The link would achieve the wikipedian editors' accepted practice of helping the reader. The linking would introduce a labor saving step of linking to the source whereupon the following data was drawn from.

Year-in articles (e.g. [[2008 in the United States]], [[2010 in science]], [[2012 in film]]), as well as, year articles (e.g. [[1982]], [[2013]], [[1603]]) are considered I quote, "intrinsically chronological articles" (as is stated [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking#Year linking|here]]). As such, these articles gain a large, thou not complete, immunity from [[WP:OVERLINKING]] of dates.

In the "Events", "Births", and "Deaths" subsections of these year-in articles data is routinely added to the monthly subsections by editors. Since 1999 and most especially since 2004, the quote/unquote events and quote/unquote deaths have been daily drawn from pages such as these [[May 2011]] and [[Deaths in October 2008]]. The year-in subsections "Events","Births", and "Deaths" have been filled into monthly subsections by editors whom believe that certain daily items warrant notability.

In particular, I state that I have for the last three years been far-and-away the major good-shepard editor of the year-in wiki articles for the United States (e.g. [[2011 in the United States]], [[2012 in the United States]], [[2013 in the United States]]) as is proven [http://toolserver.org/~daniel/WikiSense/Contributors.php?wikilang=en&wikifam=.wikipedia.org&grouped=on&page=2011_in_the_United_States here (ip 70.162 was me also)], [http://toolserver.org/~daniel/WikiSense/Contributors.php?wikilang=en&wikifam=.wikipedia.org&grouped=on&page=2012_in_the_United_States here], and [http://toolserver.org/~daniel/WikiSense/Contributors.php?wikilang=en&wikifam=.wikipedia.org&grouped=on&page=2013_in_the_United_States here].

I would like to add links within the months subsection headings (as I have done [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2005_in_the_United_States&diff=571159659&oldid=571138269 here]). I would like to add links to the months instead of a "{ {see also} }" since it would be less ubtrusive and more accurate, and thereby, more useful, to the reader.

Although I believe that all year-in articles should use this format I am only today seeking to change the year-in the United States wiki pages for the years that can be linked 1999 thru present since (1) these are the only years currently available and (2) "I" only routinely patrol the United States articles and do not wish to force other countries or catagories good-faith shepards to abide by this change if they are not so willing.--[[Special:Contributions/68.231.15.56|68.231.15.56]] ([[User talk:68.231.15.56|talk]]) 07:00, 3 September 2013 (UTC)}}

Regarding: ''"For bands, capitalized "The" is optional in wikilinks and may be preferred when listing: A number of groups increasingly showed blues influences, among them [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Animals]] and [[The Yardbirds]]."''

Why? This passage runs counter to the rest of our MoS:

The [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Music#Capitalization]] states:
* "Standard English text formatting and capitalization rules apply to the names of bands and individual artists".
The [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(music)#Names_.28definite_article.29|Wikipedia:Manual of Style (music)]] states that a lower-case definite article should be used in band names:
* "Mid-sentence, per [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Capitalization of "The"|the MoS]], the word 'the' should in general not be capitalized in continuous prose, e.g. 'Wings featured Paul McCartney from the Beatles and Denny Laine from the Moody Blues.'"
[[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (music)#Capitalization]] states: 
* In band names, and titles of songs or albums, capitalize '''all''' words '''except''': 
:*[[Article (grammar)|article]]s (''an, a, the'')
The [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Capitalization of "The"|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters]] says:
* "Generally do not capitalize the definite article in the middle of a sentence."

* According to [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists#Horizontal lists]]:
::::;Horizontal lists
::::In situations such as infoboxes, a single-line list may be useful—in this case:
::::; List type: entry one, entry two, entry three
::::{|class="wikitable"
!Heading 1
!Heading 2
|-
|List with commas
|Entry 1, entry 2, entry 3
|-
|List with {{tl|Flatlist}}
|{{Flatlist|
* Entry 1
* entry 2
* entry 3
}}
|-
|}
::::Note the capitalization of only the first word in this list (but words that are normally capitalized would still be capitalized). This applies regardless of the separator used between the list type and the entries themselves—whether it is a comma (as in the first example above), or even an infobox divider (as in the second example above).

'''Support removal'''

# Support removal. There is no obvious reason why band names should be subject to different rules from other weak proper names, like "the Tower of London", "the Acropolis" and the wording is likely to generate more contention rather than less. --[[User:Boson|Boson]] ([[User talk:Boson|talk]]) 14:00, 12 August 2013 (UTC)}}

Ka·li·nin·grad  (k-lnn-grd, -gräd, -ly-nn-grät)
A city of extreme western Russia on the Baltic Sea near the Polish border. It was founded in 1255 by the Teutonic Knights and joined the Hanseatic League in 1340. Called Königsberg, it was an important Prussian city and the birthplace of Immanuel Kant (1724). Transferred to the USSR in 1945, it was renamed Kaliningrad in 1946. Population: 426,000.

# Is the text concerning countries' obligations under international law factually incorrect?
# Does the text concerning countries' obligations under international law adopt a particular [[WP:NPOV|point of view]]?
# Does the text concerning countries' obligations under international law contain or constitute [[WP:NOR|original research]]?
# Is the duplication of this text across a large number of articles problematic?

Should there be a consensus that any of these questions can be answered in the affirmative, discussion on what material to change or remove is invited. —[[User:Psychonaut|Psychonaut]] ([[User talk:Psychonaut|talk]]) 11:56, 18 August 2013 (UTC)}}

The origins of Freemasonry are unclear. There has never been any credible scholarship linking Freemasonry to historical stonemason guilds. The cited reference cannot be used as a source to show that it actually "traces its origins to" medieval stonemason guilds since the very first page of Chapter 1 of the work makes it clear that "The narratives bring the history of masonry down to the reign of Athelstan (925-40) and must, we believe, be regarded as myths."

Could someone clarify the meaning of [[WP:DABCONCEPT]] in relation to [[WP:PTOPIC]]? For a body of works under a single owner, should the main incoming link be the broad-overview of the whole or should it be the most popular work/character bearing that name? For Star Trek this would result in the original series being [[Star Trek]] instead of the topic overview of what Star Trek is and contains. Currently, two disputes are ongoing with implications to switch the topic level to the "most popular" material or "original" material when the work contains numerous entries of the same exact name, similarly prefixed or directly related by ownership. This seems illogical and confusing to the uninformed readers and probably not the purpose of DISAMB. Specifically, PTOPIC appears to be for ambiguous, but unrelated terms that cannot be served by DABCONCEPT ''and'' sufficiently rare and limited that a disambiguation page is not necessary for organizational purposes.

{{rfcquote|text=
Currently, there is no way to discuss renaming files, and any files that fails the '''Commons''' renaming crtieria is being rejected. This seems highly unreasonable to me, since this is English Wikipedia and not Wikimedia Commons. [[WP:FILEMOVER]] illustrates the current renaming criteria. But under these criteria, a file named "Red Car.JpEg"  would only be renamed to "Red Car 321.jpg" as the 321st file named "red car". These fails article naming criteria [[WP:PRECISION]]. I think that [[WP:NAMINGCRITERIA]] should at least apply to Wikipedia's images, since it would make file names make sense, if not lengthier more descriptive names for those on slow links or with data use charges to be able to figure out what files are without downloading them. We can't even now rename files to [[WP:Use English]], as I found out at {{lf|Орден святого Михаила Архангела1988г.jpg}} where my rename request was rejected to rename the file to English from Russian Cyrillic.

As no discussion area is available for files, and administrators can rename files, and file redirects work, then [[WP:Requested moves]] should accept renaming of files. 

The reasons for Commons not renaming files are more due to the need to be acceessible over multiple Wikis, but we are only one Wiki, English Wikipedia, so we should not be restricted to just using the original upload name, there's no multiple wikis to go through and change file links, and on-wiki redirects work so there's no reason anyways.

So, in essence, we need a proper area to discuss renaming files when needed, be able to apply English naming to files, be able to name files using sensible filenames. {{tl|rename media}} should just be folded into [[WP:Requested moves]]

I would like to seek additional input on whether the story of Yelp's founding should include co-founder Jeremy Stoppelman's search for a local doctor, which is how the idea for Yelp came about. There may be more sources available, but these are the ones I found poking around a bit:

Hopefully I am accurately representing Keithbob's point-of-view when I say that he believes this is too "human interest" and the sources are the type of infotainment we tend to avoid. On the other hand, I would include how the idea for a company came about in any article about an organization when this information is available in the source material, and especially when it's in the headline of the Wall Street Journal. 

Keithbob and I have worked together on quite a few articles and I always value his feedback. On this page, he has been rejecting almost all my suggestions.

Starting a RfC: the last few years of the page have seen one complaint after another about how awful the article is; I started an improvement; almost immediately, it degenerated into an edit war.

So, with the knowledge that this stirs up POVy passions we need to work past, we could use some guidance:
::[[WP:USEENGLISH|IN ENGLISH]], should "[[Italian dialects]]" describe
:::{{sc|'''a'''}} non-recognized languages like [[Venetian language|Venetian]] or
:::{{sc|'''b'''}} ''only'' regional flavors of Standard Italian?

[[Talk:Italian dialects|Comment here]]. Answer {{sc|a}} should mean some version of my edits (listing major Italian varieties of Gallo-Romance and Italo-Dalmatian) should be kept; answer {{sc|b}} should mean that the existing page we've got should be merged with [[languages of Italy]]. In that case, we'll need help rebuilding it; and (in any case) we could use better sources.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User talk:LlywelynII|<span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em; class=texhtml">Llywelyn<font color="Gold">II</font></span>]] 12:37, 23 August 2013 (UTC)}}

{{Requested move/dated|Wikipedia:Home}}

[[:Main Page]] → {{no redirect|Wikipedia:Home}} – This is not a main page. It is by title and it is in the way that it has a load of content bundled together on it, but it is not very main for readers. The vast majority of articles are accessed by a search engine result to the article, not through other parts of wikipedia. Some readers are in fact not even aware of the existence of the main page. I am uncomfortable with it being named this but not used in that way enough. My proposed name is open for discussion, but I want something that defines it as a base page and center page, but not "main". That's too cold and hard. I think something with "home" in would work well. It fits in with 95% of other websites. It sounds recognisable and stands out as a place to start or explore articles. Do you see what I'm thinking here? It needs to look nice and friendly as a name, and perhaps more people will visit it.

Here's how the discussion will happen:<br>
The community discuss the merits and demerits of renaming, and what new names would be suitable below.<br>
After a week, an admin decides if consensus is to rename. If not, they will close this discussion. If it is, they shall start a vote on which names are most supported. The community places one vote on a potential new name in a period of five days. The most agreed upon name is taken and the Main page is moved. <font color="#151B8D">'''[[User:Rcsprinter123|<span style="font-family:cambria; font-size:10pt; color:#151B8D">Rcsprinter</span>]] </font><font color="#151B8D"> ''' [[User talk:Rcsprinter123|<span style="font-family:calibri; font-size:8pt; color:#488AC7">(speak)</span>]]</font> <small>@</small> 23:56, 21 September 2013 (UTC)}}

Based on community consensus established on [[Talk:Tammy Duckworth]], I think it is time for us to revisit our [[Wikipedia_talk:Biographies_of_living_persons/Archive_36#Proposal_on_date_of_birth|previous discussion]] on our policy on including dates of birth. 

Regarding the following policy on [[WP:DOB]] (emphasis added):
::With identity theft a serious ongoing concern, people increasingly regard their full names and dates of birth as private. Wikipedia includes full names and dates of birth that have been widely published by reliable sources, or by sources linked to the subject such that it may reasonably be inferred that the subject does not object. '''If the subject complains about the inclusion of the date of birth, or the person is borderline notable, err on the side of caution and simply list the year.''' In a similar vein, articles should not include postal addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, or other contact information for living persons, though links to websites maintained by the subject are generally permitted. See above regarding the misuse of primary sources to obtain personal information about subjects.

I propose that we replace the bolded sentence with the following text:
::'''If the subject complains about inclusion of the date of birth, and the person is borderline notable, then the date of birth may be reduced to the year only.'''

Current practice is that every year, around the beginning of October, a major RFC is started to set the rules for the upcoming Arbitration Committee election. To a large extent, the RFC is conducted on a blank slate, with everything being open for discussion, and everything requiring a fresh determination of consensus. In most years, many of the topics arrive at the same, or substantially similar results to the year prior. Rather then spending time discussing every part of the election process, we would be better served starting from the existing rules, and proposing only changes, which would then require consensus to move away from the existing status quo. Doing so would allow us to focus discussion on any actual changes being proposed, and not rehashing the same consensus. This would also allow what would essentially be a codification of the election rules on one persistent page. There would still be an annual RFC, but other then clerical issues, like the exact scheduling, it would be focused on proposals to change the rules, requiring active consensus for a change.

*'''Proposed:''' The close of [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Arbitration Committee Elections December 2012]] shall be adopted as the standard rules and practices for Arbitration Committee elections going forward. Proposals to amend the rules should be made during an annual RFC starting on or about October 1 each year.

This RfC asks: 

'''Question 1.''' Should the article include mention of the claim that disease was used deliberately by US agents and private persons against indigenous populations?
:'''A. No the claim is [[WP:Fringe]], and including it would be undue weight.'''
:'''B. Yes, the claim is a notable mainstream view found in reliable sources.'''

'''Question 2.''' Should the article specifically mention Mann's 2009 argument that the Choctaw were marched deliberately through the Vicksburg Cholera epidemic?
:'''C. Yes, the claim is well substantiated and notable.'''
:'''D No, they claim is not accepted in the general literature and it would be undue weight to include it.  

'''Survey'''

*'''B''' and '''C''' The claim is repeated in many reliably published sources and is a notable claim in the literature on Genocide against Indigenous Americans. Counter claims can be presented as well when they are sourced to sources of equal reliability. Specifically Mann's 2009 claim that the Choctaw were subjected to deliberate routing through the Cholera epidemic of Vicksburg is new in the literature and so has not been widely accepted, but it is well substantiated with evidence in the book, and the book as been generally favorably reviewed. It is however not the only source that makes the claim that disease was used deliberately. [[User talk:Maunus|User:Maunus ·ʍaunus·snunɐw·]] 15:33, 28 August 2013 (UTC)}}

This RfC asks what should be the scope of this article? Should the article either

'''A.''' have a broad scope and include all genocides perpetrated against a people on their own home territory so that the genocide against Poles, Rwandans, Croats, Irish, etc. as well as historical acts of genocide such as the Roman genocide against the Carthaginians are included. 

or

'''B.''' should the scope be narrowly defined to the international legal definition of [[Indigenous peoples]] that only include cultural minorities marginalized by colonial expansion or by the establishment of a nation state dominated by another majority ethnic group, excluding those groups who have or have later achieved their own ethnic nation state?

or

'''C.''' ?

'''Survey'''

*'''B''' The literature about "Genocide of indigenous peoples" such as Maybury Lewis 2002, Hitchcock & Koperski all use the narrow definition. Using the broad definition would  not only contradict the literature on the subject, but would cause the article to overlap almost fully with the general article on Genocide only perhaps excluding the Holocaust against Jews in so far as they are considered not to be indigenous to Europe.[[User talk:Maunus|User:Maunus ·ʍaunus·snunɐw·]] 00:54, 26 August 2013 (UTC)}}

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Consensus&diff=568425590&oldid=567090003 On August 13, 2013] [[User:SmokeyJoe]] edited the section "Determining consensus" and removed the statement that says:

{{quotation|Consensus is determined by the quality of the arguments given on the various sides of an issue, as viewed through the lens of Wikipedia policy.}}

This sentence has been the subject of extensive discussion on Wikipedia, particularly on this very talk page and I contend that it cannot be removed unilaterally unless Wikipedians as a whole reach consensus to do so.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Consensus&diff=568425882&oldid=568425590 Three minutes later] that very same user changed the title of such section from "Determining consensus" to "Reading and interpreting an apparent consensus". I, once again, contend that such content cannot be unilaterally modified without Wikipedians reaching consensus beforehand to do so.

Per both [[WP:AGF]], [[WP:BEBOLD]], and [[WP:IAR]], [[User:SmokeyJoe]] did not violate any policies and should not be subject to any disciplinary actions.

'''Proposal:''' Close the [[WP:N/N|Notability Noticeboard]], and direct posters to one or more other, related, higher-traffic pages. 

'''Background:''' The Notability Noticeboard exists to answer questions and draw attention to topics related to [[WP:N|Notability]], particularly with respect to determining whether a topic is notable (and often before an article for the topic has been created). Posts such as these arise often enough that there should be a place for them. However, almost from it's inception, the Notability Noticeboard has been plagued by inactivity and indifference on the parts of most experienced editors, and the problem has only gotten worse with time. The result is that a number of posts posed by (mostly new, inexperienced) editors, in what should be the proper place to gain notice, are going unanswered. That's a problem, and it shouldn't be allowed to persist.

More recent posts (following this [[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive805#Notability_noticeboard_becoming_defunct.3F|AN/I post]]) ''have'' been answered, thanks to the efforts of a very few editors. This may give the superficial appearance of a functioning noticeboard, but it really just masks the problem. The noticeboard will continue to fail in its mission to draw ''notice'' to posts there as long as there are only a few experienced editors maintaining it.

As this problem ''has'' persisted for ages, any solution based upon attracting experienced editors to the board is likely to be temporary and insufficient. Given that, as well as the fact that posts concerning notability are addressed daily at several other locations, the most effective solution would seem to be to close the noticeboard, and direct potential posters to place their posts on another, higher-traffic board, where they might actually gain notice. 

'''Notes:''' 
* The board itself will be  retained for historical reference, but will accept no new posts, and will have a header and/or editnotice such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mysterious_Whisper/sandbox/4&oldid=566152270 these], directing traffic elsewhere. (If you think the header or editnotice should be altered, please include your suggestions below.)
* [[WP:Wikiproject Notability|Wikiproject Notability]] and The [[WP:DRAW|Drawing Board]] exist, but both have become inactive. Jump-starting these, while a worthwhile goal in itself, should not be considered a solution to the noticeboard problem, for reasons similar to the above ("any solution based upon attracting experienced editors... is likely to be temporary and insufficient")
* For further background, see this [[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive805#Notability_noticeboard_becoming_defunct.3F|recent AN/I post]], the [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability/Archive_31#Noticeboard|original discussion]] which started the noticeboard, and these previous village pump discussions: [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/Archive_92#Notability_noticeboard|1]], [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/Archive_89#Notability_Noticeboard_.2F_Wikipedia:Proposed_Articles|2]].

{{rfcquote|text=
Should English kings prior to [[Athelstan]] (r. 927-939) be included in the article "List of English monarchs"?

'''Argument'''

For some years, this list of kings was stable and started with [[Offa of Mercia]] (774–796), following the model of the official [http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensofEngland/TheAnglo-Saxonkings/Overview.aspx  British Monarchy] site. Information on kings prior to Athelstan was removed after a discussion among a small number of editors. A list like this should be modeled on similar lists that appear in published sources. Since we don’t have limitations with respect to space, our list can be more detailed than those that are published. We can also include appropriate disclaimers for kings whose status is in doubt, so determining who was really the first king of England is not directly relevant. But I will give my view on this matter anyway. If “England” implies Angles and Saxons united in a single nation, the logical place to start is [[Alfred the Great]] (871–899). He can be credited for uniting the two peoples, with his son [[Edward the Elder]] finishing the job soon after he died. Nobody on this list used the exact title “English monarch”, so the title the person held is obviously not the determining factor. Here is what some relevant sources say:

*Mike Ashley has written a series of popular and well-reviewed books on the history of the monarchy, so he is certainly a leading authority on this subject. One of them is entitled ''[http://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-British-Kings-Queens/dp/B00AZ8IVNU A Brief History of British Kings and Queens: British Royal History from Alfred the Great to the Present]'' (2003). Ashley puts Edward the Elder at the top of the list of English kings in ''[http://books.google.com.vn/books?id=GSM4AAAAQBAJ&dq=  The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens]'' (1998, p. 468).

*''[http://books.google.de/books?id=zcgxEvGAK_kC&printsec= Handbook of British Chronology]'' (1996) by the Royal Historical Society is the only source I found that starts with Athelstan.

'''Alfred'''

*"The kingdom of England was founded in 886 by Alfred the Great," according to ''[http://www.amazon.com/The-British-Chronicles-David-Hughes/dp/0788433016/ref= The British Chronicles]'' (2007) by David Hughes. Hughes' list of monarchs naturally starts with Alfred.

*Alfred was "King over all England except for that part that was under Danish domination," according to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''’s entry for the year 900.

*"By the 890s, Alfred's charters and coinage were referring to him as 'king of the English'." ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/alfred_the_great.shtml BBC])

'''Egbert'''

*Cawthorne's ''[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00546YYKM/ref=rdr_kindle_ext_tmb Kings and Queens of England]'' (2009) and Hilliam's ''[http://www.amazon.com/Kings-Queens-Bones-Bastards-ebook/dp/B0078XHALE/ref= Kings, Queens, Bones & Bastards]'' (2011), two recent popular works, both start with [[Egbert]], so well before Alfred.

*”Egbert went on to attack East Anglia and Northumbria and unite the land that was England”, according to ''[http://books.google.de/books?id=yEIDs-DE1s0C&dq= A Short History of England]'' (2011) by Simon Jenkins (p. 26).

*”Because his domain included Cornwall, hitherto unconquered, it is fair to say that Egbert was the first king of all England,” Ashley, ''Mammoth Book''. [[User:Greatness Bites|Greatness Bites]] ([[User talk:Greatness Bites|talk]]) 12:43, 23 September 2013 (UTC)}}

I came across the "Chakra (operating system)" article via Google Search. I'd seen it (Chakra Linux) referred to in a Facebook thread. 

I often will look at the Wikipedia article for a [[Linux distro]] before going to the 'official' site as the Wikipedia article will generally present a clear concise summary upfront whereas the 'official' sites generally have self promotion—and/or specifics which assume familiarity—on the site's homepage requiring one to delve into sub-pages to get to similar details as presented upfront in a Wikipedia article. 

The point being I for one found the article useful and relevant. If a more well known distro had been referred to I wouldn't have had to look it up in the first place.

I initially came to this talk page expecting some explanation as to why it had [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chakra_(operating_system)&diff=572720171&oldid=570345554 recently] received a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Notability notability tag]. None such explanation was present.

As [https://www.google.com/search?q=Chakra+Linux&oq=chakra+linux&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j5j0.4234j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 a quick Google search] returned a plethora of hits — which, IMHO, seem to support notability — I'm going to go ahead and remove the undocumented notability template. 

Note:
<blockquote>[[Wikipedia:Deletion is not clean up|Deletion is not clean up]]. Do not use this tag merely because the page requires significant work. ''Notability requires only that appropriate sources have been published about the subject.'' It does not require that any editor has [[wikipedia:Citing sources|already named]] these sources, followed the neutral, encyclopedic style, or otherwise written a good article.</blockquote>
The above is quoted from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Notability#Usage Template:Notability#Usage]. ''Italics'' added for emphasis.

My thanks goes out to those who've contributed to [[Chakra_(operating_system)|the article]]. I found it helpful and appreciate your time and effort.

The last three sentences of the the first section seem to me to have unacceptable sources, especially the first one, which uses a review on Amazon.com. I have found the content of that review in other places online, but never in a trustworthy, published source. The second sentence I find uses a questionable source, but the biggest problem I find is that the sentence itself is unclear (perhaps the author could clarify it?). The third sentence seems to be a conflict of interest, as it is a person exonerating himself of something.

On top of all of this, these three sentences completely reverse what the entire section had been saying up to that point. Perhaps if some version of them is kept, they could be put in their own section? [[User:Shicoco|Shicoco]] ([[User talk:Shicoco|talk]]) 14:24, 27 September 2013 (UTC)}}

Hey, figured I should do this sooner rather than later. Above, I've got a little army of people invoking ENGVAR for the name of a work and they're saying we should RETAIN the title because it was originally at something that has been shown to be out of place for Wikipedia standards and consensus with no reason for an exception presented.
Aside from some of the other nonsense seen above, the problem is that these people are completely ignoring the points stated and continuing to press ENGVAR, despite the fact that ENGVAR doesn't cover situations like this at all, and the fact that this isn't even about varieties of English; "Sonic Colours" is a completely different ''title'' from "Sonic Colors", and the actual spelling of is irrelevant.
I'm sorry, I just ''really'' don't know what to do, and I'm ''really'' tired of having to butt heads with these kinds of unhelpful and disruptive people. [[User:Despatche|Despatche]] ([[User talk:Despatche|talk]]) 22:00, 23 September 2013 (UTC)}}

A dispute between myself and [[User:Sharkguy05]] about whether [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2011_Joplin_tornado&diff=prev&oldid=571034888 this] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_F5_and_EF5_tornadoes&diff=prev&oldid=571036109 this] should be the official "way it should be." The specific problem is that Sharkguy05 continues to add a sentence about the EF5 damage area being rather large according to the "official survey map." Although a reference to the map is included, there is no text-based evidence to support this claim. This should classify it as an opinion on his part. To add to this, a text-based claim in the sentence before that clearly states that the National Weather Service in Springfield, Missouri said that the EF5 damage area was "very small." Thoughts?

==Proposal for acceptance as a formal guideline'''

This "guideline" been the source of considerable debate (see rest of this Talk page, [[Talk:Falkland Islands#Metric v. Imperial|here]] and elsewhere). Many have assumed that it is an [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines#Enforcement|enforceable]] guideline, but an inspection has shown that it <s>has no standing</s> is probably unenforceable as <s>such as</s> it has not been through the [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|proper acceptance procedures]]. These procedures "require discussion and a high level of consensus from the entire community for promotion to guideline or policy". (This phrase is identical in both the current version of [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]] and the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines&oldid=352792481 version] that was current when the "guideline" was first created on 30 March 2010).
 
The page is currently taking up space in WP: space with no indication whether it is a policy, a guideline or an essay.  Its principal editor [[User:Kahastok]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&diff=571703523&oldid=571701457 wrote] "[[WP:FALKLANDSUNITS]] is a Wikiproject guideline, just like many others across Wikipedia. It represents the current state of WikiProject consensus". If this is the case, then it should have the banner: {{Guideline|category= }}and should also be a member (direct or indirect) of the '''Category:Wikipedia Manual of Style'''.  It currently complies with neither requirement so from an enforcement point of view it is at best a draft document. 

In order to clarify the position, I am putting the page forward for consideration as a formal guideline. I am publicising this proposal to every editor of good standing who has so far contributed to [[Talk:Falkland Islands#Metric v. Imperial|this debate]].

'''Responses'''

'''Oppose''' - I have many grounds for opposing the adoption of this document as a guideline.
:*There is no overriding reason why an archipelago that occupied less than 0.01% of the earth's surface needs its own guideline for units of measure when WP:MOSNUM covers the situation and make no provision for country-specific guideline in respect of units of measure. 
:*There is, as far as I know, nothing special about the units of measure used on the islands.
:*If the guideline is appropriate for all project groups, including for example the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Islands|WikiProject Islands]] group, then it should be part of the WP:MOS structure, not hidden in the space of one particular work group.  The wording of this proposal is such that it appears to apply to all work groups and as such should be integrated into MOS space.  This proposal should therefore not be adopted unless it has been moved into MOS space.
:*The opening sentence is pure conjecture. For example,[[Gibraltar]] is a [[British Overseas Territory]], but it uses kilometres per hour, and traffic drives on the right - See [https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&ll=36.154297,-5.348373&spn=0.001499,0.004517&t=h&z=18&layer=c&cbll=36.154295,-5.348375&panoid=XkkD8YswONAc5FjplfpQeA&cbp=11,187.01,,0,10.9 this picture where the speed restriction is certainly 50 km/h, not 50 mph!]. 
:*The list of exceptions to the "metric-first" rule have absolutely no justification and in many cases are probably irrelevant - do they drink draught cider on the Falkland Islands, or just bottled cider? Why choose stones  and pounds for weighing people rather than just pounds - many Commonwealth territories use only a subset of the units used in the United Kingdom - for example the [[stone (unit)|stone]], quarter and cental were not catalogued in, amongst others, [http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/1929-9/19330801-49042/pdf/1929-9.pdf Australian] and [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/W-6/page-15.html#docCont Canadian] legislation and as result, were not used in those territories. Is there a reliable source stating the practice in the Falkland Islands? 
:*Since Wikipedia is widely used in schools and the [http://www.fics.ac.fk/ Falkland Islands Community School] sits the British GCSE exams, it is, in my view, improper to emphasise the imperial units as per the proposal when such exams use the metric system.
:*Wikipedia is required to take a neutral approach in respect of the Anglo-Argentine differences over the Falkland Islands. One of the ways of achieving such a NPOV (as explained [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ#Anglo-American focus|here]]) is to <s>use terminology that is common to both countries and that cause least offence in either</s> "... seek to improve articles by removing any examples of cultural bias that they encounter...". The pro-imperial stance taken by this proposal that goes well beyond the approach taken in most similar Wikipedia articles goes against that approach. Some months ago I did a comparison of metric and imperial unit usage on various island associated with the United Kingdom and the four constituent parts of the United Kingdom.  Of the 27 articles examined, only two use imperial units as a default - one of them being the Falkland Islands.  The list of articles examined is shown below. (Readers are welcome to identify any gaps in the sets of articles chosen).
{{collapse top|Comparison of metric vs imperial in various islands associated with the United Kingdom}}
This is not really a big deal.  WP:MOSNUM states "''In non-science UK-related articles: the main unit is generally a metric unit (44 kilograms (97 lb)), but imperial units are still used as the main units in some contexts ...''". I have checked the units of measure that came first in a number of similar "UK-related" Wikipedia articles.  In order to avoid cherry-picking and also to keep the lists as short as possible, I chose sets of articles and looked at ''all'' articles in the set concerned. My findings were:

[[British Overseas Territories]]

*[[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] - all metric
*[[Anguilla]] - all metric
*[[Bermuda]] - mainly metric
*[[British Antarctic Territory]] - partially metric  
*[[British Indian Ocean Territory]] - all metric
*[[British Virgin Islands]] - all metric
*[[Cayman Islands]] - all metric
*[[Falkland Islands]] - all imperial
*[[Gibraltar]] - all metric
*[[Montserrat]] - mainly metric (aviation hieghts imperial)
*[[Pitcairn Islands]] - metric
*[[Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha]] - mainly metric
*[[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] - mainly metric
*[[Turks and Caicos Islands]] - metric

Islands off UK coast
*[[Jersey]] - metric
*[[Guernsey]] - metric
*[[Isle of Man]] - metric
*[[Hebrides]] - GA - metric
*[[Orkney]] - GA -metric
*[[Shetland]] - GA - metric
*[[Isles of Scilly]] - metric
*[[Isle of Arran]] - GA - metric
*[[Isle of Wight]] - mainly imperial

[[United Kingdom]] - mainly metric
*[[England]] - GA - metric
*[[Scotland]] - GA - metric
*[[Wales]] - GA - mainly metric
*[[Northern Ireland]] - GA - mainly metric

As can be seen, the Falkland Islands and the Isle of Wight are the two "odd men out". The general trend has been that in most of these articles, geographical measurements are quoted in metric units while in some articles, transportation measurements are given in metric units and in others, are given in imperial units.

:@Kahastok: I am not going to waste my time <s>looking into</s> rebutting all of Kahastok's misrepresentations of fact - one will suffice. Kahastok wrote "Martin ... has even [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Falkland_Islands&diff=prev&oldid=418819634 endorsed] that consensus in the past".  I actually wrote "... a very uneasy compromise has been reached ...".  These two statements are worlds apart.

Admittedly, some  were users that decided they weren't going to follow NFCC even when it was patiently explained to them, fortunately, they constituted a minority of users on Wikipedia.  The majority of the users, those that wanted to follow the policy, all had the same problem, or a variation on the same problem, understanding
or interpreting the current NFCC policy.

<br><br>

  To correct that problem, and ensure more good will in this area (not to mention, less hassle for both the users submitting an image, and the users and admins enforcing NFCC), I'd like to propose that the text that makes up the rules of WP:NFCC be made simpler, easier to understand.  With that change, it would be easier to enforce  (as it wouldn't be left up to individual interpretation of rules, due to the vagueness about what each particular rule might mean , but rather,  NFCC would be a set of simple,concrete rules) thus, easier to read,  easier to understand and easier to enforce (less abuse heaped upon the admin and non-admins who choose to enforce NFCC rules ).  I understand that no matter what change is made,  we're not going to stop those few users that want to ignore NFCC, but at the very least,  those users would be in the minority, and the abuse to both admins and users that actually enforce NFCC would be limited to those who just want to ignore NFCC. To that end, I would like to discuss a set of changes to be made to NFCC.  ''Text in italic would be a proposed change in wording ''. <br><br>

Noting that this is of personal interest to me, it still seems appropriate to add to the exceptions:

* Reverting obvious sock puppets of blocked or banned editors.

As there is a floating IP who often makes over a hundred edits in a day (the last one I counted was 126 in 4 hours).  Some of his incarnations have been blocked since early 2012.  It would be simpler if topic-banned admins (or even rollbackers) were allowed to mass-revert all of the (new) IP's edits, without worrying as to whether the edit falls into the restrictive topic.  — [[User:Arthur Rubin|Arthur Rubin]]  [[User talk:Arthur Rubin|(talk)]] 15:00, 3 September 2013 (UTC)}}

The last time I could find this as being discussed in the archives was [[Wikipedia talk:Templates for discussion/Archive 5#Disallowing userbox nominations on this page|January of 2006]] and since [[WP:CCC|{{Abbr|CCC|Consensus Can Change}}]] especially in over seven and a half years, I think it is worth discussing again.  Userboxes are templates and if they are in Template: space, than nominating them as anything other than a template doesn't seem or feel correct.

I feel the inclusion of this animation in this particular article is unnecessary. As a topic that is innocuous at best and probably used for reference by minors, there is no intrinsic value whatsoever in including a grainy animation of a naked man with a flapping penis. As I stated above, there is already a Commons category link in the page where people can watch these images if they so wish. [[WP:NOTCENSORED|Wikipedia is not censored]] but it's also not "edgy".

I would like to propose that articles about tornado outbreaks have a standard naming convention, namely the following:
#All tornado outbreaks occurring after 2010 (2011 onward) will have article titles based upon the dates of their occurrence, in the format "Month day–day, year tornado outbreak" or "Month day–day, year tornado outbreak sequence". Some outbreaks occurring before 2010 have well entrenched names ([[2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak]], for example) and would be best left as are.
#The default name format for tornado outbreaks will be "Month day-day, year tornado outbreak", with consensus being needed to switch to a [[WP:COMMONNAME|common name]]. The goal of this is to have a standard name for tornado outbreak articles to be created at when they occur and to gain a "power of hindsight" as to which common name becomes the true common name, if any, since tornado outbreaks often have many local and or national common names. This "power of hindsight" will help to prevent time consuming naming disputes like occurred over the [[2011 Super Outbreak]] name, a common name in the days immediately following the [[April 25-28, 2011 tornado outbreak]] that did not become the long term common name.<br />

Should this article have an infobox?

This article was originally started with an info box but that was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Venus_and_Mars_%28Botticelli%29&diff=430421018&oldid=430287976 subsequently deleted] by an editor, with the curious observation that the infobox "detracts from the painting", when the article was substantially in its present state, and which editor had contributed nothing previously to the development of the aticle and went on to make only a few techical edits of the same nature. By contrast the info box had survived a number of substantial contributing edits by another user who has a [http://toolserver.org/~snottywong/cgi-bin/editorinteract.cgi?user1=Victoriaearle&user2=Ceoil&user3=&user4=&user5=&user6=&user7=&user8=&user9=&user10=&ns=none&startdate=&enddate= close working relationship] in the Visual Arts project with the deleting editor.

The arbitration committee has recently published findings on the issue of infoboxes, of which notably was found that there ought to be a discussion for each individual article in the absence of a global policy.

I request such a discussion now. 

Especially I would really like to know how an infobox "detracts" from a thumbnail of a painting. This thumbnail points to a very beautiful high resolution image of the painting held on Commons. Of course it's pleasant that you can see a reduced image of the painting in the article and it serves a purpose as reminding us what the image actually is, but most users wishing to enjoy the image will immediately click through to the high resolution image held on Commons.

The frank impression I have is that the editor who deleted this infobox sees the article in some way as beautiful in itself. Well, that's frankly extremely silly.  I'm not sure there isn't something of a ''hoc fecimus'' claim involved as well. But of course we know editors give up copyright, and to claim moral rights simply isn't tenable. Ironic to observe that the image itself is (claimed) to be in the public domain. In this case we aren't given a source but it's almost certainly the National Gallery (London). Unlike its Washington counterpart this gallery doesn't put their digital reporoductions in the public domain, you have to poy good money for them. I have no idea how much it charges for its high resolution images, I should think a lot. On the most optimistic interpretation of the circumstance, what we have here is a philanthropist who has acquired the image and "gifted" it to Wikipedia, who may reproduce it with impunity essentially because in US copyright law "mere labour" can't be copyrighted. Quite a lot of other people might well, on the contrary, simply think the image stolen.

I should think the time for the National Gallery to challenge that are long past. But if it were still possible to mount a credible challenge, then Wikipedia's case I should imagine would be much strengthened were these thumbnail images provided soley in the context of an infobox in an encyclopaedic article and not as  a reproduction adorning a web page as our deleting editor plainly thinks it should be.

I really would like to see a convincing argument for not having an infobox in this article. No doubt Wikipedia will one day develop metadata for art objects. In the meantime infoboxes provide a useful half-way house. In particular there are fields for catalogue numbers and gallery URLs that would be awkward to incorporate otherwise.

From the project page of WP:Countries, I read this:

{{quote|As noted at [[Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes]] the number of templates at the bottom of any article should be kept to a minimum. Country pages generally have footers that link to pages for countries in their geographic region. Footers for international organizations are not added to country pages, but they rather can go on subpages such as "Economy of..." and "Foreign relations of..." Categories for some of these organizations are also sometimes added. Templates for supranational organizations like the European Union and CARICOM are permitted. A list of the footers that have been created can be found at Wikipedia:WikiProject Countries/Templates/Navboxes, however note that many of these are not currently in use.}}
This is all eminently sensible, but as everyone who regularly reads or edits country articles will know, these suggestions are regularly flouted. You can see it at [[Turkey#External links]] and [[South Africa#Further reading]], just to name two articles which I edit fairly often. I have no way to knowing if the unofficial guidelines above reflect a well-established consensus, or if they are the work of few editors, but I think many will agree that the continued proliferation of those footer navboxes is undesirable, and that their use in country articles should be reduced. The suggestions above try to establish some inclusion criteria of sorts, even though the difference between [[international organizations]] and [[supranational organization]]s is not at all clear, but if they are to have any effect ''they need to be followed'', otherwise they're just dead letter. Is there any consensus in support of this?--[[User:Underlying lk|eh bien mon prince]] ([[User talk:Underlying lk|talk]]) 02:44, 15 September 2013 (UTC)}}

There have recently been a number of debates in [[WP:MOSNUM]] that ended in an edit-war in the article [[United Kingdom]] regarding the primary units of measure UK Geographic articles. 

A few years ago, all MOS-type pages relating to regional articles were moved to the [[WP:MOS]] tree so that regional recommendations were visible to all.  Although units of measure style guide has been centralised at WP:UNITS, there has been little or no input from [[WP:UKGEO]] in respect of which units of measure should be the primary units in UK Geographical article. I propose a new mechanism to ensure that WP:UNITS reflects the views of all editors. The process will be that each section of [[WP:UNITS]] will be associated with one or another Wikiproject and that debates regarding that section will take place on the talk pages of the Wikiproject concerned. Those editors connected with WP:UNITS rather than the project will have a responsibility for coordinating various inputs and ensuring a consistent format of the WP:UNITS page. 

I propose therefore that WP:UNITS be amended as follows:
*The following section is inserted between the subsections "UK engineering-related articles" and "Other articles":
::'''''UK geographical-related articles'''''
::''Although [[Geography]] is usually classed a [[science]], at times it has been classed as a [[humanities|humanity]]. In order to cover both these aspects, geographic measurements that are specific to the United Kingdom should use SI units as the primary unit of measure (as per scientific articles) followed by, where appropriate, the equivalent alternative (imperial) unit in brackets (as per non-science articles).'' 
::''All changes to this recommendation are to be debated at [[WP:UKGEO]].'' 
*In the sub-section '''''Other articles''''', the text 
::''In non-science and non-engineering UK-related articles: the main quantity is generally ...'' 
:is replaced by 
::''In other UK-related articles: the main quantity is generally ...''
:This is a general maintenance change.

There is a discussion on the talk page of the [[WP:WikiProject Council|WikiProject Council]] about a proposal to merge a number of WikiProjects. It touches on the governance of WikiProjects in general. The discussion would benefit from much wider participation. The specific proposal, entitled "Merging projects - Fringe", and initial reactions to it, can be found [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Council#Merging_projects_-_Fringe|here]]. An alternate proposal, entitled "Merging projects - Compromise", and reactions to '''it''', can be found [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Council#Merging_projects_-_Compromise|here]].

Please read both threads carefully. Please comment, under the appropriate subheading of this RfC, on any or all of these three questions.<br>Do you support or oppose the initial proposal?<br>Do you support or oppose the alternate proposal?<br>If you do not support either proposal, should a second RfC be initiated to solicit alterative proposals for a merger of some or all of the projects listed in the initial merger proposal?

Both the role of WikiProjects in general and the specific topic of [[WP:FRINGE]] can engender passionate debate.

We seem to be getting attacked by SpamBots a lot recently, or bots inadvertently get logged out during it's runs.

Recent events related to archive.is have left Wikipedia's links to that service in a state that requires a community decision.

''' Background '''

"Archive.is" is a website that functions similarly to the more established [[Wayback Machine]]: Both provide an archiving service whereby snapshots of web pages across the internet are saved in a vast repository. In case archived pages become unavailable at their original locations, or their content is removed or changed, these archive services provide a static backup of each page, each of which can be linked to with presumably more assurance that their content will remain online and intact. Compared to Wayback Machine, which is much older and established, Archive.is is a newer competing service. Wikipedia articles have commonly used links to Wayback Machine's version of web pages for use in their [[WP:REF|references]] in order to combat [[link rot]].

A [[WP:BOT|bot]] called [[User:RotlinkBot|RotlinkBot]], created by [[User:Rotlink]], has recently begun linking Wikipedia articles to the new Archive.is service. This bot was not approved, and was therefore subsequently [[WP:BLOCK|blocked]]. 

Following this block, the bot was used in an anonymous operation using IPs from three different Indian states, Italy, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Bulgaria, Qatar, Latvia, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Brazil, Argentina, Portugal, Spain, France, Mexico, Austria, and South Africa, raising strong suspicions that the IPs were not being used legally. These IPs, and [[User:Rotlink]], self-identified as the owner of archive.is,  were subsequently blocked. Rotlink has not commented on any of the blocks.

Over 10,000 links to archive.is remain on Wikipedia.

''' Points to consider '''

#Archive.is is a relatively young archiving service.
#No one has found any problems with the quality of archived links. So far as anyone can determine, archive.is is presenting an accurate record of all material it claims to archive.
#In [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Link_rot#Archive.is this discussion], [[User:Rotlink]] identifies himself as the owner of archive.is.
#Rotlink wrote [[User:RotlinkBot]], a bot which created links. It was unapproved, and blocked because of unapproved operation. Again, the bot seemed to operate reasonably well: minor defects were noted, but nothing serious. The motivation for the block was the unapproved operation.
#RotlinkBot did not exclusively add links to archive.is: it added links to other archiving sites as well, and apparently in preference to archive.is in some cases.
#On September 3, 2013, {{userlinks|94.155.181.118}} began inserting links to archive.is, as well as links to other archive sites. This appears to be RotlinkBot running anonymously.
#By September 17, 2013, the list of IPs that were inserting had grown. It included at least the following:
#*{{userlinks|188.217.203.245}}
#*{{userlinks|61.15.46.216}}
#*{{userlinks|27.3.85.26}}

#*{{userlinks|109.175.88.133}}
#*{{userlinks|190.244.69.154}}
#This list of IPs included three different Indian states, Italy, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Bulgaria, Qatar, Latvia, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Brazil, Argentina, Portugal, Spain, France, Mexico, Austria, and South Africa. 
#Based on that pattern of IPs, [[User:Kww]] concluded that not only was RotlinkBot being used anonymously in violation of its block, but that the IPs being used were likely to be anonymous proxies or a similar form of botnet. He blocked Rotlink, all of the IPs, and a few more IPs that were discovered later.
#He called for edits by the IPs to be rolled back at WP:ANI: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&oldid=573791554#Mass_rollbacks_required
#Many editors and admins reverted.
#At this point, over 10000 links to archive.is remain in Wikipedia.
#At this point, [[User:Kww]] has no firm proof of illegal activity, although he remains of the opinion that this is likely.
#[[User:Rotlink]] has made no comment in respect to his block.

The current situation is awkward. It's impractical to place the link on the spam blacklist, because the spam blacklist will interfere with editing any of the articles that contain a link to archive.is. It seems strange to have so many links, but to claim that no more links can be added. Several editors view the rollbacks themselves as destructive. We need to figure out how to go forward.

There would appear to be several options.

'''Options'''

''' 1. Remain where we are '''

Wikipedia is notoriously inconsistent, and this is just one more case. There's no need for blacklisting, no need to remove the existing links, and no need to restore links that were removed due to the improper bot use.

# '''Support''' Per my comment in the discussion section below. I put a lot of work into changing over broken links to archive.is links when pinkpaper.com went offline. I don't see why my hard work should be undone because of someone else's misbehaviour. If someone spammed links to BBC News all over Wikipedia, and we found it was a BBC News employee, that wouldn't change the fact that BBC News is a useful and reliable source. Behaviour issues on the part of this unapproved bot operator doesn't change the fact that archive.is remains a useful service that ensures a fair number of references are actually [[WP:V|verifiable]]. —[[User:Tom Morris|Tom Morris]] ([[User talk:Tom Morris|talk]]) 12:52, 21 September 2013 (UTC)}}

I'd like to propose some changes to the naming conventions of television episode articles that are not [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]]s of their name. In my view, the current practice of disambiguating articles by simply the series name seems fairly vague, and could benefit from a more concise title. I would suggest fixing this situation by modelling the practice of [[WP:NCMUSIC]], where non-primary songs are disambiguated as "(song)" or "(Artist X song)" if there are multiple songs of the same name. For these respective situations, I suggest changing the naming guideline to recommend using "(episode)" or "(Series X episode)". With this possible addition, my intention is to make the article names for clear for readers at quick glance, which the series title alone may not do.

Sources say Curt Leviant was born in 1932, but in a very recent interview, Leviant mentions he was born 69 years ago, which implies a birth year of c. 1944.  How, exactly, do we handle this?  I have double checked the sources.  (EJ below refers to ''Encyclopedia Judaica'' 2nd ed, 2007.)

I am aware that one single wrong source may have been quoted by everyone afterwards.

The [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2013 September 11#Template:R from move|deletion discussion]] that recently closed with '''no consensus to delete''' as noted above is obviously unsatisfying for some contributors.  The main problem seems to be the allegation that some editors misuse this Rcat by tagging a redirect-from-move with it, thereby making a 2nd edit to the redirect, which makes it more difficult to revert the move.  Several possible solutions were discussed for this gnarly problem, and the closer of the deletion discussion suggested these be further discussed.  So to try to avert yet a third attempt to delete this Rcat, I feel it's important to try to come up with a solution that will best serve the Wikipedia project and all readers and contributors.

Since its introduction, the Parental Advisory has become a prominent label in the music industry. However, it often goes unrecognized and unmentioned in articles of albums in which it appears. This may be due to Wikipedia's preference of uploading album artwork without the label, in addition to the fact that several articles simply leave that particular information out. Since we include parameters for other important information in the infobox (label, duration, etc.) I suggest we add a field for the appearance of a Parental Advisory label. More specifically, I would suggest that the field be formatted in such a way where users can input a simple yes or no response, though we can certainly discuss the exact functionally below.

Deciding about mentioning of the [[self]] as part of the [[Universe]] (defined as totality of existence). There is bias on the matter, as many think that the [[Universe]] is just about the [[astronomy|astronomical]] model.

'''Survey'''

'''Discussion'''

This page about the Universe is currently missing an essential part. I added it and it got removed.
:The Universe [...], including '''[[self|yourself]]'''
If anyone feels that his presence in the Universe is not real, or not relevant to the topic, let's talk about it.
This page is about the Universe at Whole, as totality of existence, and not just about some limited models (theories/descriptions) of it.

The exclusion of the Self from the Universe is a common flaw of perception/interpretation that I feel we should signal explicitly.
The interplay between the subjective Self and the objective Universe is the key to a more profound understanding. Relativity once accepted, makes all other theories dependent on their purpose (including astronomy).

In a broader sense, in its current form, this article gives the wrong impression that the Universe is ambiguously out there somewhere, in the galaxies that only astronomers see, or in the Physics lab where bosons are experimented or in some mathematicians mind where complex equations make sense.

22nd September 2013 I opened up the subject on the talk page in order to reach a wider audience of readers that would be able to comment on the issue. Not the least, I would have hoped that those responsible for the current content on the Great Dane page would have taking opportunity to argue why their version of history should be considered the whole truth. Thus far no comments have been forthcoming. On advice, I therefore expand the subject to a "Requests for comment" (RfC)matter and hope to be able to canvas more readers for arguments.

See the preceding section. There are two main candidates to be the primary image (i.e. the image in the infobox): the one that is currently there (since [[User:EeuHP]], now blocked, added it a few days ago) and the one that was there before (the charter that is lower on the page right now). I have argued that the contemporary charter, bearing the subject's signature and perhaps her own thoughts or words, is superior to a much later image that was never intended to depict the subject, but was mainly decorative. User:EeuHP has argued that the lead image to a biographical article should by default be a depiction of the person, and that disqualifying posthumous or late images would leave most pre-modern biographies barren. Is one image more appropriate as the lead image for this subject? [[User:Srnec|Srnec]] ([[User talk:Srnec|talk]]) 01:33, 9 October 2013 (UTC)}}

;Background
Genres have plagued most if not all music-related articles for as long as I've been an contributor here. In that time, I've seen many suggestions for how to remedy this problem -- all of which haven't really done much to reduce the amount of vandalism, editwars and seemingly endless debates. The project at one point disabled the parameter, which was immediately met with widespread backlash. Some users have tried using hidden comments to prevent editing genres, but these are often times completely ignored and genres are still changed, and many of these hidden comments are written in a rather [[WP:OWN]]-y way without much supporting discussion. Sometimes a user will add a source with a genre, but there's no discussion or analysis to determine whether or not this single source represents a minority or majority viewpoint. Genre seems to be subjective to some degree, so what's to say this one source doesn't just represent one single person's opinion? 

;Supporting data
Just to strengthen my argument a little, I took it upon myself to gather a small bit of supporting data. I examined five FA/GA articles on my watchlist ([[Radiohead]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Slayer]], [[Bullet for My Valentine]], [[Bleeding Through]]) and sifted through the last 50 edits in the history. I tallied up all edits involving a genre and determined that about 30% of all edits pertain to genre (an average from the five articles with a range of 18-46%). The majority of the time these edits were reverted, so that means ''about a third of all edits to musical ensemble articles (based on these five FA/GA articles) are undesirable and thrown away'' -- occasionally leading into tireless discussions, edit wars and notice board comments.

;Proposal
(Please forgive my lack of technical knowledge here. Also forgive the metal-leaning of the examples.) To help curb this percentage, I propose that the genre field becomes similar to the "background" field in that it only accepts certain values. So if "metal" is listed in the field, it will display [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]]. I am also proposing that the field only accepts community-discussed umbrella terms like "heavy metal" and ignores hyper-specific subgenres and styles like [[Neo-classical metal]] and [[Symphonic black metal]] -- if either if these were to be entered into my proposed updated field, nothing would display. A lot of the warring seems to stem from these subgenres, so forcing the field not to allow them might help to prevent pointless edits. The field's documentation already recommends to, "Aim for generality (e.g. [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]] rather than [[East Coast hip hop]])," so I don't think this is too drastic of a request if that's already what we're asking from editors. Also, the field should allow for a maximum number of genres to be listed (say, three?).

This would also reduce the number of pointless hidden comments (that go ignored anyways), parenthetical notes like "current genre" and "early genre", and completely made up genres.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mastodon_%28band%29&diff=219235028&oldid=218918173]

The energy and arguing that goes into deciding which genres should be listed in the infobox (which is meant to be general anyways) should be shifted toward focusing on writing a well-sourced and thought-out section on the ensemble's style instead.

{{Notice|The question I am asking is this: Should we include an image in this template?}}

All of the similar templates have images. This template used to include an image, [[:file:Crownburger2.jpg]], but it was removed by an other editor. As a result, a discussion was held but unfortunately that discussion was poorly framed by me, and the outcome was problematic. Because I phrased the question rather ambiguously, the result was about a dozen against and a similar amount for some sort of image being included. However due to my poorly phrase question, those who thought there should be an image included was split roughly in half with some in favor of the same image and other supporting changing the picture to another image. In hope to get a more concrete outcome, I am starting a new RfC that is asking a simple question- Should this template include an image, yes or no?

Just to make sure that the point of the discussion is clear: I am not asking what image should be included, just should we include one? The question of what image should be included will come after, depending on the outcome of this discussion. --<span style="font-family:lucida sans, sans-serif;">[[User:Jerem43|Jeremy]] <small style="font-size:85%;">([[User talk:Jerem43|blah blah]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jerem43|I did it!]])</small></span> 05:00, 8 October 2013 (UTC)}}

There is currently a dispute as to whether the shooting of Jews by Einsatzgruppen should be described as "executions" or "murders" in the caption to the infobox images. In favor of using the latter term, I note that "execution" carries with it the connotation of a killing sanctioned by a lawfully constituted judicial authority after an individualized adjudication of guilt. Surely the actions of the Einsatzgruppen in rounding up people and shooting them do not even have the form, much less the substance, of judicial killings. Rather, as crimes against humanity, the killings of Jewish civilians are properly described with the term "murders".

This is a '''[[Wikipedia:Requests for comment|request for comment]]''' about the upcoming '''[[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2013|December 2013 English Wikipedia Arbitration Committee election]]'''.

'''Purpose of this request for comment''': To provide an opportunity to amend the rules on the on structure, rules, and procedures of the December 2013 English Wikipedia Arbitration Committee election and resolve any issues not covered by existing rules.

'''Background''': Based on a [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)/Archive_109#Proposal_to_change_the_way_the_yearly_Arbitration_Committee_Election_RFC_is_conducted|Request for Comment held in September]] this year's Arbitration Committee Election RFC will run somewhat differently than it has in previous years. The RFC adopted the close of last year's [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Arbitration Committee Elections December 2012|ACERFC]] as the default rules for elections going forward. Instead of needing to arrive at a fresh consensus every year on the election rules, the yearly RFC will now focus on proposals that either change the rules, or that deal with issues not previously decided. 

In the case of proposals that change existing rules, or that seek to establish new ones, lack of consensus for a change will result in the rules from the 2012 RFC remaining in force. Some issues are not covered by the existing rules but will need to be decided one way or another for the operation of the election, in those cases it will be up to the closer to figure out a result, even if there is no clear consensus, as they have had to in the past.
{{quote box|align=center|title=[[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Arbitration Committee Elections December 2012|Close of the 2012 ACERFC]]|bgcolor=lightgreen|
quote=*'''Election:'''  This year there will be 15 Arbitrators.  The election will consist of eight 2 year terms.  Any new vacancies that open before voting begins will be 1 year terms.  Vacancies after voting begins will not be covered in this election.  50% support is minimum to be accepted as an arbitrator.
*'''Candidates:'''  Same requirements from last year: 500 edits, editor in good standing, not under block or ban, meets Foundations access to non public data and willing to identify, and has disclosed alternate accounts (or disclosed legitimate accounts to Arbcom)
*'''Timeline:'''
**Electoral Commission RFC: Now - Saturday 23:59, 17 November 2012 (see below)
**Nominations: Sunday 00:01, 11 November - Tuesday 23:59, 20 November 2012 (10 days)
**Fallow period: Wednesday 00:01, 21 November to 25 November 2012 (5 days)
**Voting period: Monday 00:01, 26 November to 23:59, 9 December 2012 (14 days)
**Scrutineering: Monday 00:01, 9 December 2012 - ??? (whenever the Stewards are finished)
**No deadline for releasing or announcing the results.
*'''Guides:''' Allowed but with some strong suggestions.  See below.
*'''Voting:''' A voter needs 150 mainspace edits by 1 November and registered an account before 28 October.  The existing system (Support/No Vote/Oppose) will be used with percentages calculated via Support/(Support + Oppose).  Secret ballots will be used.
*'''(NEW) Electoral Commission:''' A RFC to be completed NLT 2nd week of Nov and closed by Jimbo and will determine 3 Electoral Commission officials who will solve disputes and problems during the election
*'''Questions:'''  While there does seem to be consensus to have a list of general questions, it looks like any specific work to be done on them needs to as yet take place at: [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2012/Questions/General]] {{fontcolor||cyan|(For this year [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2013/Questions/General]])}}
*'''Advertising:''' The upcoming election should be advertised through a watchlist notice and the traditional notices posted to various community noticeboards. Banners shouldn't be used.
}}

'''Structure''': This RfC is divided into portions based on whether the question is unresolved or would amend the existing rules, and further divided into sections, each of which contains a question for the community to discuss. The standard RfC structure will be used, in which any user may make a general statement that other users may endorse if they so agree. The questions will be listed in the [[#toc|table of contents]] below, along with the users who have made statements.

The questions have been chosen in part from the comments from [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2012/Feedback]]. More questions may be added if other concerns arise.

'''Duration''': This RfC is scheduled to last for about '''30 days'''; on or after '''1 November 2013''', it will be closed, and an uninvolved editor(s) will determine the result of the RfC. The results will determine the structure, rules, and procedures for the election.

{{rfcquote|text=
This request for comment (RFC) is regarding a revision to the sidebar ([[MediaWiki:Sidebar]]) to improve usability and ease of navigation.

''' Principles '''

The proposed changes that follow in this request for comment arise from the following conclusions we can draw about our site's navigation.

# Even compared to other pieces of site-wide navigation, '''the sidebar is an extremely important navigation tool'''. With the vast majority of readers and editors using a skin (Vector or Monobook) with the sidebar placed on the left, it is in a natural position of important considering English speakers tend to scan left to right.
# '''The sidebar is currently cluttered'''. On the Main Page, English Wikipedia readers see 22 links, not including language links. Basic usability priniciples tell us that more choices increases the amount of time users have to spend understanding navigation (see [[Hick's law]]), and that simplicity and clarity are worthwhile goals. The most recent design of the homepage of [[Google.com]], famous for its simplicity, has half the number of links, for comparison. While removing some semi-redundant links (like Contents or Featured contents) would be preferable, if we're going to have this many links it means prioritization is key, leading to the next point...
# '''The sidebar has poor prioritization.''' Users read top to bottom, and it is not unfair to say that the vertical order of the links should reflect some basic priority. However, currently, this prioritization is sloppily done. For example: the Wikimedia Shop and Donate functions are above very common and important functions like [[Help:Contents|Help]] and the [[Contact page]]. Even if we assume all the current links are important and should stay, the order needs work.
# The '''names for some links are overly verbose or unclear.''' [[Hamlet|Brevity is the soul of wit]], and of good Web usability. We should not use two or three words where one will do.

''' Proposed sidebar '''

This proposal does not remove any links currently in the sidebar. It simply reorders and renames them, in the following way:

[[File:Screenshot of the MediaWiki sidebar on a test wiki.png|170px|Proposed version]]

Note the following changes and rationales:

* Key navigation and help tools &ndash; mainly About and Help:Contents &ndash; are moved in to the main navigation section. These two links are particular relevant to many readers and new editors.
* "Interaction" is renamed to "Contribute". Interaction is a vague term that in many instances implies any interaction with software or people. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, first and foremost, and we want to encourage contributions more than we necessarily just want people to interact with each other. Note that [[Wikimedia Commons]] has taken a similar approach with their "Participate" section.
* Contributory functions like Upload file, Recent changes, the Community portal, and Donate are all moved to this renamed section.
* A new "Create page" link is added, leading to the [[Wikipedia:Article creation]] guide. There is currently not a single piece of site navigation that mentions creating new pages. The key contributory links "Edit" and "Upload file" are both exposed to readers and editors alike on most pages. Page creation is the only core encyclopedic activity which requires the user to eithe search or happen to find a link (in this case a red link).
* The "Wikimedia Shop" link is renamed to Merchandise for the sake of simplicity, and is left in its current place.
* Toolbox and Language links are unchanged.

''' Comments '''

''' Implement the proposal in its current state '''

* I support this update, obviously, as the author of the RFC (at least its first draft). <font style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">[[User:Steven Walling|Steven Walling]]&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;[[User talk:Steven Walling|<span style="color: #8080b0">talk</span>]]</font>  05:38, 3 October 2013 (UTC)}}

RfC: Should one or more of these photographs be included somewhere in the body of the article? (not infobox)

*[[:File:Zimmerman, George - Seminole County Mug.jpg|Photo #2]]. Caption: "Identification Photo used in court proceedings; taken at Seminole County Sheriff's Office in 2012"

::<small>'''Notes on RfC'''
:#An exhaustive search of the web for photographs of Zimmerman that are not trial related was conducted. There are three known pictures from before the shooting, but they are rights holder unknown (presumably Zimmerman). Due to Wikipedia Fair Use restrictions it is probably not possible to use them since public domain pictures of Zimmerman exist, or could likely be made to exist. Thus the only pictures of Zimmerman available are trial related, there is no prejudice or bias in choosing trial related pictures, rather that is all that exists to document Zimmerman visually on Wikipedia. 
:#Picture #1 and #2 were selected from the Commons pool based on previous discussion for as neutral a pose, background, expression and context as possible.</small>

"Most decorated soldier" or "One of the most decorated soldiers" has been an ongoing edit war with this article since its inception. Before we go to FAC, this needs to be settled on how to handle this.

There are conflicting opinions online as to who is the most decorated,  Audie Murphy or [[Matt Urban]]. Both camps are ardent in favor of their hero, and both camps want their hero's Wikipedia article to be accurate on the count.

Murphy was hailed as "most decorated" before he was ever out of uniform. Matt Urban did not receive his Medal of Honor until 1980. The "when" of Urban's MoH does not matter. It's the total medal count.

Numbered lists are below.  The Matt Urban list came from his article which does not seem to have all his medals listed.  Please add medals to either list as appropriate and leave an appropriate edit summary.  The automatic numbering is generated by the # to the left of the item.

An edit dispute between two versions of [[Ronan_Farrow#Ethiopia]] exists between [[user:Tenebrae]] and myself. My suggested text is (differences between our versions highlighted in bold): 
:''In January 2008, Farrow and his mother, Mia Farrow, accompanied U.S. Rep. Donald Payne on a short visit to Kenya, following which he wrote an opinion column for the Los Angeles Times criticizing counter-insurgency operations in the Ogaden desert by Kenya's neighbor, Ethiopia. '''The Ethiopian consul in Los Angeles responded to the column by noting Farrow had only interviewed a single person living in Kenya to arrive at his conclusions and observing Farrow had "failed to study the geopolitical intricacies of the Horn of Africa'''."''
His suggested text is: 
:''In January 2008, Farrow and his mother, Mia Farrow, accompanied U.S. Rep. Donald Payne on a short visit to Kenya, following which he wrote an opinion column for the Los Angeles Times criticizing counter-insurgency operations in the Ogaden desert by Kenya's neighbor, Ethiopia. '''The Ethiopian consul in Los Angeles, Taye Atske Selassie, wrote a letter to the Times saying Farrow had "quoted a single person in Kenya claiming Ethiopian security forces were responsible for human rights abuses, but the 'separatist rebels' had merely carried out a few attacks," and that Farrow had "failed to study the geopolitical intricacies of the Horn of Africa.'''"''
Ultimately, this is a question of which version is more readable (my 42 word sentence or Tenebrae's 60-word sentence), as I think they're both factually accurate. [The functional differences are (1) I believe it is appropriate, as a point of editorial style, to omit Consul Taye's name and simply refer to him as "the Ethiopian consul in Los Angeles" as he is a relatively unknown person and it reads a bit smoother by decreasing the word count in an otherwise unwieldy sentence, (2) use "noting" instead of "saying" [while both terms may be appropriate, I think 'noting' offers a smoother read than the more utilitarian "said this" "said that" and is synonymous with "saying" in any case - [[user:Tenebrae]] believes the word "noting" instead of "saying" is a violation of WP:NPOV], (3) accurately paraphrase the article instead of inserting a long quote from Consul Taye as this would keep it stylistically consistent with the lead-in sentence which summarizes Farrow's position instead of copypasting it] 
We had previously disagreed on the date - I wanted to insert the date of January 2008 while [[user:Tenebrae]] kept reverting to April 2008 (an unsourced date originally inserted by a [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/FortyTwoAndAHalf/Archive|7-identity sockpuppet]]) - however, we were able to come to a conclusion on that point on our own (January 2008) and this is the only remaining point of contention.

An Rfc on whether the Wikipedia controversy on Chelsea Manning should be included in the Gender transition should be included in the article. There are several versions to be considered. 
 
 
1. Obiwankenobi and startswithj's version: 
 
 
Several media outlets noted Wikipedia's quick rename of the page title from Bradley Manning to Chelsea Manning the day after the announcement; Wikipedia was then critiqued when the page was reverted to Bradley Manning a week later. After further discussion, Manning's Wikipedia page was again renamed to Chelsea Manning in October 2013 by consensus of the community.
 
 
2. BobK31416's version: 
 
 
While Reuters, The Guardian, the Daily Mail, and Wikipedia[1] changed name and pronouns immediately in accordance with Manning's request...
 
 
The footnote for Wikipedia would be,
 
 
About a week later Wikipedia changed its article's title back to Bradley Manning, and roughly a month after that it was changed back to Chelsea Manning, which is its current title.
 
 
3. BobK31416's other proposal: It seems pretty clear how to apply this guideline: simply delete the last three sentences of the paragraph, and we're done.
 
 
4. Original sentence: 
 
 
Several media outlets noted Wikipedia's early rename of the page title from Bradley Manning to Chelsea Manning, in advance of other media sources.Wikipedia was then critiqued when the page was reverted to Bradley Manning a week later, including a critical blog post by Wikimedia Foundation executive director Sue Gardner. After further discussion, Manning's Wikipedia page was again renamed to Chelsea Manning on October 8, 2013.
 
 
5. Neutron's version:
 
 
Almost immediately after the announcement, Wikipedia editors changed the article about Manning to use female pronouns in reference to the subject, except where quotations in the article used male pronouns. The title of the article was almost immediately changed to "Chelsea Manning" and was then switched back and forth between "Chelsea" and "Bradley" several times, until a consensus in favor of "Chelsea" was reached on October 8, 2013. 
 
 
6. Revised form of Neutron's version:
 
 
Almost immediately after the announcement, Wikipedia editors changed Manning's article to use female pronouns and renamed the title to "Chelsea Manning"; further discussion resulted in the title being reverted to "Bradley Manning" for a month, until a consensus in favor of "Chelsea Manning" was finally reached on October 8, 2013.
 
 
7. Frungi's version: 
 
 
While Reuters, The Guardian the Daily Mail, and '''Wikipedia''' changed name and pronouns immediately in accordance with Manning's request,
 
 
8. Konveyor Belt's version: 
 

On Wikipedia, although the first few moves were overturned,after two move discussions her page was formally renamed to Chelsea in October 2013. (transcribed from [[User:Konveyor Belt/Manning]])

The "format" parameter at [[Template:Infobox television]] appears to be a deprecated parameter, having been replaced by genre long ago over concerns that "format" is an ambiguous terminology that creates confusion.  The parameter has not been officially retired or deleted, so the confusion persists.  There are three proposals on the table so far: A) Delete the format parameter from the template once and for all.  B) Leave the parameter, but clearly mark it as obsolete in the template description. C) Re-define what "format" means for those who edit television articles. For context, history and scope the [[Template talk:Infobox television#Format vs Genre: The Final Battle!|main discussion is here]]. 20:31, 7 October 2013 (UTC)}}

This RFC concerns policy from [[WP:MOSNUM]] ([[MOS:DATEFORMAT]] and [[MOS:BADDATEFORMAT]]), [[MOS:COMMA]], and [[WP:NCPLACE]]:

My proposal is that instead of being mandated or not being mandated, MOS should be changed to make it optional as to whether a comma should be included after a date or a place: ''April 14–16, 2011 tornado outbreak'' or ''April 14–16, 2011, tornado outbreak''; ''Rochester, New York metropolitan area'' or ''Rochester, New York, metropolitan area''. If passed, a second part of this proposal would mandate that all pages within a certain Project be the same. This means that the comma would be optional on the "national" standpoint, but one version would be mandated by a discussion from a "local" Project standpoint (all pages within any Project either with the comma or without the comma). This allows members of a project to decide themselves on what to do and prevents ridiculously long site-wide discussions such as [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (geographic names)/Archives/2013/September#Commas in metro areas|this]].

The "supremacist" and "neo-Nazi" labels are contended by the website's owner, Don Black:
:<code>''"Don Black contends that Stormfront is not a supremacist Web site, arguing instead that it is focused on racial pride"''</code>
Source: Digital Media and Democracy: Tactics in Hard Times, Megan Boler, Mit Press, 2008, page 409 [http://books.google.com/books?id=GEUcAQAAIAAJ]
:<code>''"Interviewer: [...] Would that be a correct perception [neo-Nazi]?"''</code>
:<code>''"Black: [...] That doesn't mean that we are Nazis, but we are certainly going to be called that among other things as a matter of course by our opposition. [...] To answer your question, no, I don't consider myself a Nazi, but that's a term that's frequently applied to us and it's not entirely accurate. It's like calling every liberal a communist. No one gets away with that in the mainstream media today, but they routinely get away with it when referring to us."''</code>
:<code>''"Interviewer: Would you also reject the term "white supremacist"?"''</code>
:<code>''"I think that's an inaccurate description of most of the people that are part of our movement [...] today the people who are attracted to the white nationalist movement want separation. And so supremacy really isn't descriptive of what we want, the changes we want to see."''</code>
Source: Contemporary Voices of White Nationalism in America, Carol M. Swain, Russ Nieli, Cambridge University Press, 2003, page 156 [http://books.google.com/books?id=RonIunZ521sC]

So, should the lead be accommodated with this information, just like it is done in "[[Jared Taylor]]" (which even uses the same source (Swain, Contemporary...)): ''"He rejects these accusations himself, saying that his views are reasonable and moderate.[7]"'' or in [[Golden Dawn (Greece)]]: ''"Scholars and media have described it as neo-Nazi[5][10][11] and fascist,[12] [13][14] though the group rejects these labels.[15]"''

Why should this article be exempt from this and the owner's own description be suppressed from the lead? This goes against [[WP:NPOV]]. So my proposal is to change the lead from:

''"Stormfront is a white nationalist,[2] supremacist[3] and neo-Nazi[4] Internet forum that was the Internet's first major hate site.[5]"''

to

''"Stormfront is a white nationalist,[2] supremacist[3] and neo-Nazi[4] Internet forum, though the latter two labels are contended by the website's founder, Don Black.[5][6] It was the Internet's first major hate site.[7]"''

How should this article be structured and sourced? [[User:The Rahul Jain|Rahul Jain]] ([[User talk:The Rahul Jain|talk]])

I would like to propose the following structure, we can have five sections in this article,
#In the first section, we can mention the Vedic background of the two religions and the Jain reaction to vedic rituals and sacrifices.
#In the second section, we can mention the attitude of Hinduism and Jainism towards the gods of each other religions.
#In the third section we can mention about the puranic (epic-writing) tradition of these religions. We can write about hindu and jain versions of great epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata.
#This section could be about the comparision of philosophical concepts like ''karma'', ''dharma'' and ''samsara''.
#The last section can be about the social and cultural life of Jains and Hindus.

For the Sources, I propose the four authoritative textbooks of Jainism that is 
*{{cite book|last=Dundas|first=Paul|title=The Jains|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-26606-2}}

Two out of these, Dundas and Glasenapp, have '''a chapter each that deals specially with the relationship of Jainism and Hinduism'''. In the ''Jaina path of purification'', we have section where Jaini writes about intermingling of Jains with surrounding Hindus which might be one of the causes of survival of Jainism in India.
We also have two papers presented by Jaini, one talks about "Rishabha as an avatar of Vishnu" and the other, which talks about counter epics written by Jains to compete with hindus.

Ramanujan also gives account of Jain version of Ramayana which can be used here.
*{{cite book|last=Ramanujan|first=A.K. |editor=Paula Richman|title=Many Rāmāyaṇas: The Diversity of a Narrative Tradition in South Asia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XkifYfljHP4C|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-07589-4|chapter=Three hundred Rāmāyaṇas: Five examples and Three thoughts on Translation}}

There is also a controversial issue regarding ''Jainism being a sect of Hinduism'' or ''whether jains are hindus'', this is also covered in Dundas (under the chapter ''the question of Jaina identity'') and also by flugel. If this is in the scope of the article, we can give a brief account of it.

*{{cite journal|last=Flugel|first=Peter|title=The invention of Jainism: A short history of Jaina studies|journal=International Journal of Jaina Studies|year=2005|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1-14|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/98/1/The_Invention_of_Jainism_%28without_photo%29.pdf}}

Based on the sources I presented, I have created a new draft at [[User:The_Rahul_Jain/Jain-Hindu_relations2]]. I would request any improvements on the proposal.[[User:The Rahul Jain|Rahul Jain]] ([[User talk:The Rahul Jain|talk]]) 09:55, 11 November 2013 (UTC)}}

As per the RfC above, 6 people opposed entirely to including the owner's description, and 5 (4 + me) support the idea of including it, but making the sentence neutral so that it does not give undue weight to what other sources say. So I am making a new RfC, because making a bold edit (which Mann_jess suggested) will be met with a definite revert, so there is no point in that.

So, how about changing the lead from:

''"Stormfront is a white nationalist,[2] supremacist[3] and neo-Nazi[4] Internet forum that was the Internet's first major hate site.[5]"''

To Maunus' suggested version:

''"Stormfront is a white nationalist,[2] supremacist[3] and neo-Nazi[4] Internet forum that was the Internet's first major hate site.[5] Don Black, the website's founder, states that the site's purpose is not to promote white supremacy, but rather white pride and white nationalism.[6][7]"''

{{rfcquote|text=
Is it possible to follow the above suggestion on medical images, especially those concerning imagery of a anatomical or pathological nature to be placed in collapsible galleries?
See suggestion:
{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
|-
! Suggestion about collapsible galleries
|-
| <blockquote>I wish to make a case for the use of collapsible galleries or images on Wikipedia for use in articles of medical nature, especially that of images showing faces, children, excessive blood and death in a life-like photographic fashion - of which images under [[Anencephaly#Signs and symptoms]] do (''these images have been heavily debated on said articles talk page''). This does not apply to journalistic or artistic images which are not in the same way meant to convey raw medical imagery, but instead emotional content in a way that is meaningful to the general public.
A summary of arguments for allowing collapsible galleries is:
*1.
Strictly descriptive medical images are often without value for the general public. The general public may not be capable of understanding the full implication behind such images. A user researching [[Gluteus maximus]] is most likely not interested in imagery concerning dissections of the gluteus maximus. A collapsible gallery may prevent the need for a new article [[Dissection of gluteus maximus]]. While this clearly applies to many images on Wikipedia, such as a great many images in articles concerning physics and mathematics the following points are not at play in these cases:
*2.
Pathology is at large considered a field of medicine involving difficult imagery and scenes which the general public may find objectionable in a manner which undermines amassing knowledge in the subject.
*3.
Even pathologists find certain forms of imagery and certain cases very distressing even after years of practice in normal pathology.
For example '''pediatric pathology''' is performed at select universities by only certain practitioners because it is considered too emotionally distressing for the average pathologist. The average Wikipedia user can most likely be deemed less hardened by experience than the average pathologist who needs first 5-6 years of medical school, after which at least 5 years of pathological training is undergone.
*4.
Anatomy is at large considered a science concerning subjects which are hard to access without proper prerequisite knowledge. As opposed to pathology, anatomical subjects are often embalmed and may show signs of rot, mildue and other decaying apart from normal pathological findings. Anatomical subjects are also due to embalming discolored which may make them with less obvious value in explaining the subject than the much more prolific drawn images. Muscles are not always shown in the same detail as most images. Again collapsible galleries would allow these images without the need of a new article solely on dissections.
*5.
Dissections for medical students are normally preceded by ethical discussion as well as the availability of counseling. This is not readily available for a curious Wikipedia user stumbling far into unknown terrain.
*6.
Otherwise objectionable content may be very useful for a medical professional, not so much so for non-professionals. 
Dissection images do not by large give any meaningful help on anatomical articles for understanding of the subject matter. A large argument for dissections is normally the 3D advantage they give, this is absent in images.
They may on the other hand give meaningful content to the medical professional or the anatomist who consults the article. It may be very difficult to find images on Wikimedia commons in the same way that they can be presented under a closed collapsible gallery of images.
*6.
There is a very clear distinction of what is an image with sole purpose of conveying medical knowledge and what is not. Guidelines proposed can dismantle the slippery slope argument and may be:
Broad and clear as to cover many cases so as to offer large room to display images without a collapsible gallery but still allowing for the covering of the most gruesome images.
Examples of guidelines, of which several or all may need to be fulfilled can be:

''These are merely proposed criteria''
::'''The image is not deemed to have artistic or journalistic value - as such is only of value showing a medical concept.'''
::'''The image is not deemed to be relevant to a non-professional member of the general public.'''
::'''The image contains deformed or damaged faces or other recognizable normally visible body parts, children and excessive blood or dead individuals.'''
::'''The image is a photograph.'''
::'''Non-photographic images are unable to convey the subject matter in a manner sufficient for the general public.'''
These guidelines quite clearly discount images not normally seen as very objectionable such as those of the [[Heart]].
*7.
Wikipedia’s aim to be a source of knowledge is furthered by the possibility of articles containing imagery which may be of utmost relevance but may still be objectionable as per [[WP:NOTCENSORED]]
<blockquote>Shock value: Some images of medical conditions or procedures disturb some readers, e.g., because of visible deformities or the presence of blood. Potentially disturbing images should be not be used for their shock value, for decoration, or merely to add an image. A detailed caption that identifies specific features may simultaneously increase the educational value of the image and reduce the likelihood of disturbing readers. Placement in a highly relevant section, rather than in the introduction, is also likely to reduce the shock value to readers. Wikipedia:Offensive material offers additional advice.</blockquote>
This allows for a broader availability of these images by not tempting the average user to remove them from articles instead of moving them to an appropriate section.
*8
The suggestion addresses the apparent issue of [[Help:Options to hide an image]], where the user is asked to have access to the knowledge of how to hide images before using Wikipedia. This suggestion would simplify new users getting to grips with medical articles on Wikipedia, and may very well serve to increase contributions to this part of Wikipedia.

I would like to point out that this suggestion has the goal of increasing the availability of medical images on Wikipedia, and not in making them less available. It would also alleviate the need to make individual dissection articles for every subject.

The articles [[Miniature Australian Shepherd]] and [[Miniature American Shepherd]] are about the same dog breed. What occurred was that members of the organization promoting/breeding the Australian dogs pushed for AKC recognition, which they received, under the Mini American moniker, while part of the same group refused to recognize the AKC recognition themselves and kept the Mini Aussie name. This, to me, is a fairly obvious [[WP:POV fork]] and one of these articles needs to be merged somewhere. I proposed they both get merged to the Mini American page with discussion of the controversy, since that's the recognized name, and you can see what resulted above. I'm bringing this to RFC to open the issue up to a wider audience, so editors unaffiliated with either breed can comment on the issue. So my RFC boils down to this:

'''Do the [[Miniature Australian Shepherd]] and [[Miniature American Shepherd]] articles constitute a POV fork, should they be merged, and if they should be merged, under what breed name should they be merged - the original name (Mini Aussie) or the [[American Kennel Club]]-recognized name (Mini American)?''' --'''[[User:Tikuko|<font color="black">T</font><font color="orange">K</font><font color="gray">K</font>]]'''!

Russians release lab analysis

October 29, 2013. Russia Claims Syrian Rebels Used Chemical Weapons 

The samples taken from the impact site of the gas-laden projectile were analyzed at a Russian laboratory certified by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Churkin said.
He said the analysis showed that the unguided Basha'ir-3 rocket that hit Khan al-Assal was not a military-standard chemical weapon.
Churkin said the results indicate it "was not industrially manufactured and was filled with sarin." He said the samples indicated the sarin and the projectile were produced in makeshift "cottage industry" conditions, and the projectile "is not a standard one for chemical use."

[[File:Employment growth by top tax rate.jpg|right|thumb|]]
An editor, [[User:EllenCT|EllenCT]], would like to include the graph to the right, or the juxtaposition of the data in prose, in various articles to make the point that US job growth rates declined as the top marginal tax rates declined.  

Several editors have concerns that the graph suggests correlation, and perhaps causation, between US top marginal tax rates and job growth history from 1940 to present without a reliable source stating that.  

When asked for sources, EllenCT, has provided the following:

=== Rationale '''

[[Wikipedia:Articles for creation]] (AFC) has a regular backlog of '''over 1,500 submissions''', all currently stored in various makeshift locations. These submissions fall on a handful of volunteers to review, provide feedback on, and potentially pass to article space. This is not only an issue at AFC, but at other article drafting venues. These venues (including AFC) handle new article submissions from newer users who aren't very familiar with Wikipedia's policies, and likely can't create articles on their own yet that would meet our [[WP:N|inclusion]] or content standards.

One obstacle to this constant influx being manageable is the multitude of locations where new article submissions are placed. Some go to the submitter's [[WP:USERSPACE|userspace]], others to AFC subpages, some to [[Wikipedia:Article Incubator]], and so forth. This not only makes work difficult for the current volunteers, but also discourages new volunteers from participating, and creates an even more confusing situation for the submitting user.

''' Proposal '''

'''Proposed:''' Create a new [[WP:NAMESPACE|namespace]] for article drafts, called "Draft:", to serve as a central location for new article submissions posted through [[Wikipedia:Articles for creation]] and the other venues aimed at newer users. This way, the task of reviewing submissions will be a less fragmented process, and it will be easier for volunteers to collaborate.

Additionally: 
* Submissions from anonymous users (IPs), which lack a true userspace, will be far easier to locate. 
* [[WP:Article incubator]] is currently not of any help, and it has reached a point where it is nearly non-functional.
* A single location allows easier access for automated or semi-automated tools that check for [[WP:COPYVIO|copyright]], [[WP:BLP|BLP]], and other issues.

'''Note:''' This proposal does not concern any reforms to the way drafts and reviewing is currently handled, but rather organizing where they are stored. Also note, this proposal came up at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/RfC 2013]], where there was significant support, but technicalities prevented it from being implemented at the time.

''' Details '''

The new Draft namespace would function as follows:

# A separate namespace, named ''Draft'' would be created. This namespace would serve as the location for creation and improvement of draft articles before being transferred into the mainspace. All articles in the draft namespace will be called using ''Draft:ArticleName'' in Wikitext. All pages on this namespace will be NOINDEXed.
# This namespace would supersede the current draft article locations as the default location for draft articles. These current locations include Article Incubator, Userspace drafts, AfCs and other such locations. Except userspace, all articles currently in these namespaces will be transferred to the Draft namespace.
# The current policies that currently apply to AfCs and Userspace drafts (with respect to deletion, content etc) would extend to the new namespace, including any other criteria as seen fit. Any drafts at AFC inactive/not edited for a period of six months would be liable for deletion, as is current policy.
# All policies pertaining to Userspace drafts would be now modified for the new namespace. Any new users creating drafts would be directed to the new namespace. Users would, however be permitted to retain and create their drafts in the userspace if so desired.
# [[WP:AfC]] would continue to operate the way it currently does. All articles created through AfC would contain the AFC codes and would pass through the review process as is currently followed. But as done for other drafts, it would be permissible to directly move articles from the Draft namespace to mainspace.
# There will be a separate discussion/RFC to decide the fate of the Article Incubator process. The RFC would decide whether the process remains the way it is, or if it is marked as historical, or any other alternatives.

Is the information in this article currently presented in a way as to give readers a reasonable and clear overview of the subject matter?  Is it consistent with Wikipedia's general article standards, as well as with specific expectations for articles about fiction?  How can we improve the encyclopedic tone of the article?

There is a debate on whether the lede image for the brassiere article should include a woman.  Some editors prefer and insist upon an image without a woman.

Other editors feel that the photo is poor quality, but also argue that there is nothing wrong or un-encyclopedic with showing a bra on a woman.  The second photograph from the commons has been proposed as a sample alternative to a bra on a manikin which is well lit and composed, showing a 2/3rd view including more of the garment structure.

A section in this article has a verifiability and inaccuracy issue. These are the paragraphs being disputed:

"The Philippine Military Academy traces its history back to the Academia Militar which was established on October 25, 1898 at Malolos, Bulacan. General Antonio Luna, Secretary of War for the young Philippine Republic was commissioned to organize a cohesive standing army. He realized that an Officer Corps had to be trained in order to attain his goal. He recruited the best of the former Spanish "Guardia Civil" (Army) Officers to be the members of the faculty of the institution, Academia Militar."

"The Academia was established by General Emilio Aguinaldo, the first president of the young Philippine republic. The school was meant as a training ground for future officers of the armed forces. Its first superintendent was (Spanish) Captain Manuel Bernal Sityar, Jr. The Acad.emia Militar was forced to close down on January 20, 1899, however, as hostilities broke out between the Americans and Filipinos."  

TO WIT:
-- There are no NOR references given or even inline citations to back-up this assertion.
-- In the Infobox there is no mention of Academia Militar under former names; Date established is February 17, 1905. The Academia Militar was established November 1, 1898.
--PMA was established by the U.S. backed Commonwealth government (December 21, 1936, Commonwealth Act No. 1 ) . The Academia Militar was activated by the Philippine Revolutionary government November 1, 1898. 
-- Therefore, unless proven through a verifiable third party source (NOR), the disputed section/paragraphs should be deleted.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:TheMilitaryExpert|TheMilitaryExpert]] ([[User talk:TheMilitaryExpert|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/TheMilitaryExpert|contribs]]) 03:58, 5 November 2013 (UTC)}}

There is no screenshot of XP SP1, for instance, because no major visual changes occurred. Similarly, the Start Screen will include all my software in installation, and I'm not going to uninstall the applications I have installed just to take a screenshot that will be removed for failing Fair Use. " I'm confused and I think the screenshot must '''not''' be there at least in the infobox of the article.

For proof, the full message is available [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sonicdrewdriver#Just_One_Thing here @ Drew's talk page] in 10th paragraph.

I think it would be the best if Lisa asked regarding this matter in the talk page of this article.

Now I ask openly to other users, shall the use of Windows 8.1 screenshot will be reverted to the previous screenshot of Windows 8 which is [[:File:Windows 8 Start Screen.png|this]] or not ?

And yes, unless [[User:Sonicdrewdriver]] compromises the situation or being solved by other users, please don't remove the RFC.

Should [[WP:SPI|SPI]] restore the requirement of selecting codeletters for [[WP:CU|checkuser]] requests?

There has been an increase in the number of [[WP:SPI|SPI]] requests that discuss the likelihood of users having and using multiple accounts concurrently, but that do ''not'' indicate any pattern of abuse. Per [[WP:SOCK|the policy on sockpuppetry]], sockpuppetry is defined as "the use of multiple Wikipedia user accounts '''for an improper purpose'''" (emphasis mine). For this reason, checkuser requests which suggest the presence of multiple accounts but do not indicate any pattern of abuse are generally denied until such abusive behavior can be identified. 

Several years ago, to file a request for checkuser, the filing editor had to select a "codeletter" which indicated what category of abuse (vote fraud, ongoing serious vandalism, ban evasion, etc.) was occurring along with the request. This was later abolished on the basis that it was confusing to editors. This RFC is regarding a possible return of those codeletters, potentially with improvements to avoid the confusion from before. The old set of codeletters can be found [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/SPI/CheckUser_criteria&direction=next&oldid=358748004 here]. A "support" consensus on this RFC would imply a need to re-evaluate the old codeletters, adjust them if necessary, and support clerk denial of checkuser requests that are not using established codeletters. --[[User:Shirik|<span style="color:#005">Sh</span><span style="color:#007">i</span><span style="color:#009">r</span><span style="color:#00A">ik</span>]] <small>([[User talk:Shirik|<span style="color:#88C">Questions or Comments?</span>]])</small> 00:34, 27 October 2013 (UTC)}}

While it is a long established Wikipedia principle that [[WP:Competence is required]], this is relaxed for new editors. It is also expected that such newbies be [[WP:DONTBITE|treated more gently and more patiently]] than experienced editors.  However, it is usually not evident if an unfamiliar editor is a newbie, and therefore should be treated specially. To better indicate the proper level of interaction, I propose implementation of a '''newbie flag''', as follows.

A "newbie" icon to be suffixed to the signature of new editors, based on the presence of a newbie template in their Talk page, along with a suitable banner. This would provide instant identification without having to examine their Talk page or logs.

New editors to be advised that:
:1) They are expected to not edit recklessly, but first become familiar with the basic principles. (I.e.: look before you leap. Even better, ask first.)
:2) The newbie icon automatically suffixed to their signature cautions other editors to treat them gently and patiently; new editors are expected to not abuse that.
:3) The newbie icon also reminds experienced editors to either explain any abbreviations and [[wikijargon]] they use, or add appropriate links.
:4) The icon will go away when the newbie template is removed. The editor is then presumed to be familiar with various principles and expectations (i.e., "grown-up"), is expected to conduct themselves accordingly, and to not try the patience of other editors. They may expect any lapses to be treated summarily.

This proposal could be considered an extension of (and could incorporate) the {{tl|I'm a new user!}} template, which only displays an icon and banner on the Talk page, and is not automatically included. This proposal is distinguished from the {{tl|This is a new user}} template, which only reminds other editors to not bite the newbie.

The essence of this proposal is the automatic addition of a special icon to an editor's signature if the newbie template is present, and advising the editor of the significance of that.

(I'm pretty much an editing newbie. It took me 20 minutes just to figure out how to make this request, and I've probably done it wrong.) My issue with this page is that it doesn't read well, probably due to English being a second language for one or more of the main contributors. I started trying to make small edits to improve readability, but the problems became so extensive that I could no longer determine the true meaning from just what was written. (How do you replace "thrive" accurately when it is used as a noun?) I didn't want to replace unintelligible phrases with understandable, but wrong, substitutions. This air of confusion seems to damage the article's value, perhaps beyond redemption without a subject expert's knowledge to repair the broken English.

}}

While it is a long established Wikipedia principle that [[WP:Competence is required]], this is relaxed for new editors. It is also expected that such newbies be [[WP:DONTBITE|treated more gently and more patiently]] than experienced editors.  However, it is usually not evident if an unfamiliar editor is a newbie, and therefore should be treated specially. To better indicate the proper level of interaction, I propose implementation of a '''newbie flag''', as follows.

A "newbie" icon to be suffixed to the signature of new editors, based on the presence of a newbie template in their Talk page, along with a suitable banner. This would provide instant identification without having to examine their Talk page or logs.

New editors to be advised that:
:1) They are expected to not edit recklessly, but first become familiar with the basic principles. (I.e.: look before you leap. Even better, ask first.)
:2) The newbie icon automatically suffixed to their signature cautions other editors to treat them gently and patiently; new editors are expected to not abuse that.
:3) The newbie icon also reminds experienced editors to either explain any abbreviations and [[wikijargon]] they use, or add appropriate links.
:4) The icon will go away when the newbie template is removed. The editor is then presumed to be familiar with various principles and expectations (i.e., "grown-up"), is expected to conduct themselves accordingly, and to not try the patience of other editors. They may expect any lapses to be treated summarily.

This proposal could be considered an extension of (and could incorporate) the {{tl|I'm a new user!}} template, which only displays an icon and banner on the Talk page, and is not automatically included. This proposal is distinguished from the {{tl|This is a new user}} template, which only reminds other editors to not bite the newbie.

The essence of this proposal is the automatic addition of a special icon to an editor's signature if the newbie template is present, and advising the editor of the significance of that.

{{rfcquote|text=
Should the term "Jewish" be allowed to describe the conman Monty Casino character in a set of 1980 [[Barclay's Bank]] commercials?  Shall the content be changed to "seen as" a Jewish character?

'''Background'''

In 1980, Peter Sellers performed in some commercials for [[Barclay's Bank]].  The commercials can be viewed here (Youtube video link removed as copyright violation. Not hosted by copyright owner).  As you can see in the ads he plays a conman named "Monty Casino."  

In this article, this character is described with the line, "Filmed in April 1980 in Ireland, he played a Jewish conman, Monty Casino."  This despite the character's religion not being indicated or mentioned in the commercials.

The sources provided by three proponents who support the usage of the term "Jewish" are as follows:

* 1.  The book ''The Life and Death of Peter Sellers'' by Roger Lewis states "The Jews which Sellers played on 'The Good Show were oy-vay caricatures , with names like Geraldo or Izzy; and concurrent with his death he was to be seen on television as a Jewish conman Monty Casino, urging viewers to invest their monty in Barclay's Bank" 

* 2.  The Peter Evens book ''The Man Behind the Mask'' states as in relation to Sellers being condemned for playing derogatory Jewish caricatures: "A commercial he made for Barclays Bank in which he played a conman called Monty Casino, was attacked on the same grounds".
 
* 3.  The [[Adrian Rigelsford]] book ''Peter Sellers: A Life in Character'' states "In 1980, Sellers shot three adverts as Monte Casino, a Jewish con-man"

* 4. The newspaper ''[[The Northern Echo]]'' states "In 1980, it signed comic actor Peter Sellers to play South London spiv Harry Hodges in a commercial. On the first day of shooting, he got rid of the writer and created his own character, a Jewish con man called Monty Casino."

The users SchroCat, Cassianto and Dr. Blofeld have been working extensively on this article for a long time and argue passionately for the usage of the term "Jewish."  --[[User:Oakshade|Oakshade]] ([[User talk:Oakshade|talk]]) 21:12, 1 November 2013 (UTC)}}

Due to delayed manifestation of symptoms in chemical agent exposure, the number of Iranian chemical warfare victims will increase in the future. In addition, 218,867 Iranians died due to war injuries and it number included 56,575 army forces personnel (25.8%), 41,040 Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) (18.8%), and 87,822 volunteers (40.1%). Meanwhile, civilians (mostly women and children) account for 15.3% (N=33,430) of total deaths. The mean age of martyrs was 23 years old.

According sources above, for Iranian side we get 123,220–160,000 [[Killed in action|KIA]], 60,711 [[Missing in action|MIA]], 320,000–500,000 [[Wounded in action|WIA]], 40,000–42,875 [[Prisoner of war|POW]], 11,000–16,000 [[Civilian casualties|civilian dead]], and total killed of 200,000–262,000. On Iraqi side total dead toll is 105,000–200,000 plus 400,000 [[Wounded in action|WIA]] and 70,000 [[Prisoner of war|POW]]. So, for someone who <u>read books</u> it isn't hard to conclude something went very wrong when see 3-4 higher maximum figures for both sides. Beside reliable secondary sources above, there's no much difference even in less-reliable tertiary sources like [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/iran-iraq.htm Global Security] or [http://www.iranchamber.com/history/iran_iraq_war/iran_iraq_war3.php Iran Chamber]: they give 300,000 Iranians lost lives (fits under total + MIA), 60,000 Iraqi prisoners (near to 70k), and 375,000 Iraqi casulaties (not "killed" as described in Wikipedia, GS gives medium of 200,000). There's no much difference neither in [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/293527/Iran-Iraq-War Britannica] which gives total number of killed on both sides as perhaps 500,000 (fits fine, plus mentioned Kurds). At the end, I've provided 8+3 sources, now here are your "sources":
# Hammond Atlas of the 20th Century (1996) 
# Dunnigan, A Quick and Dirty Guide to War (1991) 
# Dictionary of Twentieth Century World History, by Jan Palmowski (Oxford, 1997) 
# Clodfelter, Michael, Warfare and Armed Conflict: A Statistical Reference to Casualty and Other Figures, 1618-1991 
# Chirot, Daniel: Modern Tyrants : the power and prevalence of evil in our age (1994) 
# War Annual: The World in Conflict [year] War Annual [number]. 
# "B&J": Jacob Bercovitch and Richard Jackson, International Conflict : A Chronological Encyclopedia of Conflicts and Their Management 1945-1995 (1997)
All of them are in same format and missing many parameters. Comparing it to other references, it's obivous that it has been inserted by same user to illustrate a point. Number six is my favorite: no name, no year, no publisher, no year, no page, no nothing. That's what you call "[[WP:RS|reliable source]]"? It's not sole problem, I checked Chirot's book ''Modern Tyrants'' and there's no any source regarding war casualties at all. If one of book was misquoted, it's my right to be suspicious about all other. User [[User:TheTimesAreAChanging|TheTimesAreAChanging]] has claimed "Western sources suggest that 262,000 to 600,000 Iranian soldiers were killed". '''Which sources'''? I want to see [[WP:RS]] with author names, publishers, pages with prtscs to [[WP:VERIFY]], as I did. Seven "sources" are inserted in text below, but if not verified it should be removed.

This dispute about sources has started after [[User:Coltsfan|Coltsfan]] and [[User:TheTimesAreAChanging|TheTimesAreAChanging]] both assumed bad faith and called me "POV-pusher" [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War&diff=579267207&oldid=579218053][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AIran%E2%80%93Iraq_War&diff=579651606&oldid=579484843]. Awesome, now explain me this:
* Why would "Iranian POV pusher" decrease number of killed Iraqis from 375,000 to 180,000? [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War&diff=579424399&oldid=579417511]
* Why would he call conservative Western estimate of 262,000 just as an "estimate"? [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War&diff=579218053&oldid=578973024][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War&diff=579435931&oldid=579434706] Why not "conservative" or "highest Western estimate"?
* Why would he use Israeli sources like Amatzia Baram and [[Efraim Karsh]]?
* Why would he actually even try to decrease Iranian figures if it's widespread that "hundreds of thousands" of Iranians were affected due to controversal Iraqi chemical attacks?
Simply epic, thank you guys. :) If you [[Wikipedia:Assume bad faith|assume bad faith]] next time, at least try to assume it on logically proper evidence. --[[User:HistorNE|HistorNE]] ([[User talk:HistorNE|talk]]) 05:21, 2 November 2013 (UTC)}}

A particular formulation, that "LaRouche said AIDS had been created by the 'Soviet war machine,' or by the International Monetary Fund to kill 'excess eaters' in Africa," has been re-inserted into the article. This same formulation appears in a number of press citations, but none of them identify the original source document or provide any additional context. They all say that the original source is a "133-page report" which is not identified. The question is whether it is permissible to include this in the article, or whether it violates [[WP:RS#Quotations]], which says that:
:''The accuracy of quoted material is paramount and the accuracy of quotations from living persons is especially sensitive. To ensure accuracy, the text of quoted material is best taken from (and cited to) the original source being quoted. If this is not possible, then the text may be taken from a reliable secondary source (ideally one that includes a citation to the original).  No matter where you take the quoted text from, it is important to [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT|make clear the actual source of the text, as it appears in the article]].  

:''Partisan secondary sources should be viewed with suspicion as they may misquote or quote out of context.  In such cases, look for neutral corroboration from another source.''

== Proposed new Draft namespace '''

{{Archive top|1=
The first thing to clear up is what exactly is being discussed. TheOriginalSoni's first proposal included discontinuing the use of userspace drafts and moving userspace drafts into the proposed drafts namespace. This has clearly and resoundingly been rejected by editors. TheOriginalSoni then modified the proposal to allow the continued use of userspace drafts. A number of users suggested that because of the change in what is being discussed, that the RfC was therefore hopeless and unsalvageable and that a new RfC should be conducted with a new proposal. I don't see consensus for that view given the number of people in both the support and oppose camps who have modified their !votes to reflect the changed proposal. [[WP:NOTBUREAUCRACY]] applies: having another RfC for this would be a triumph only for [[rules lawyer]]s. The proposal was changed fairly soon after the opening of the RfC and enough discussion has taken place on the redrafted version of the RfC for this to no longer be a concern.

The case made for this change is that it will simplify the process of submitting draft articles (as has been done through AfC), and will help both experienced users and creators of bots and tools better support the processes around these articles. Some users have opposed on the basis that it will not help reduce the backlog of pages awaiting review at AfC. This is not something which the proposer suggested the change would bring about: it failing to do something it does not set out to do probably ought not to be considered a particularly compelling objection.

A number of users argued that a Drafts namespace would fix technical issues with the AFC process and enable the creation of a toolset that is slightly less "kludgey" to be constructed. The issue of search was raised: currently, searching for a topic in the 'Wikipedia talk' namespace brings up a significant number of AfC submissions. Segregating these off would make the search function more useful for editors.

Against the proposal were a number of objections. A number of users argued that there is a risk of creating new layers of bureaucracy. This is indeed a valid concern. A number of users objected that it fixes no problem, although no substantial discussion was given to rebut those claims made of exactly how it ''would'' fix problems.

After weighing the arguments, it seems clear that there is '''support''' for the principle at the heart of the proposal: a new namespace for Drafts. The participants in this discussion expressed a variety of views on the effectiveness of the Articles for Creation project, but no challenge was made to the proviso that AfC would continue as it currently does. This community discussion does not change the AfC process—any such decisions should be ones that the AfC WikiProject should make through further consensus-based discussion if they deem it to be necessary. A key part of this discussion is the very strong support for the principle that users should be able to store drafts in their userspace. This principle must be adhered to in the implementation of this RfC: the Drafts namespace may be strongly encouraged for new editor, but if a registered editor wishes to keep drafts in their userspace, they must be allowed to do so. The processes for deleting userspace drafts (like [[WP:MFD]]) remain the same; userspace drafts should be treated the same once the 'Drafts' namespace is in place as they are now.

{{rfcquote|text=
This has been boggling me since this became a WikiProject a year ago. Originally, this WikiProject began as a task force under the Latin America WikiProject. However, there were problems when dealing with this. Namely that there artists who are not from Latin America that perform Latin music. You have artists from Spain like Enrique Iglesias and Alejandro Sanz who are considered to be Latin artist (they sing Latin pop), and you have Julio Iglesias who holds the Guinness Record for being the best-selling Latin artist of time. As if that wasn't enough, you have artists who sing Latin music in addition to other languages/genres such as Laura Pausini and Eros Ramazzoti from Italy as well as Linda Ronstadt and Vikki Carr from the United States. As a result, we had to change the WikiProject's name to Latin music to emphasize that we're not just dealing with artists from Latin America anymore. In fact, this project has more to do with linguistics as a genre now rather than a regional scene. To further support this, this project mostly deals with the Hispanophone market in Latin America, Europe, and the United States. We also allow Lusophone artists and recordings as well (just from Brazil and Portugal though). 

As a rule thumb, I use the [[Latin Grammys]] criteria on the geographical which, as a I mentioned, includes Latin America, Spain, Portugual, and the United States. But here's the problem arises: What should be done about artist who crossover into the Latin music market? Specifically, what should be done about songs originally peformed in another language, but re-recorded in Spanish or Portuguese by the same artist? This is generally not a problem for artists like Enrique Iglesias, Shakira, and Marc Anthony since they're considered Latin artists. But what about crossover songs like those from Christina Aguilera and Beyoncé? Examples from both artists include [[Genie in a Bottle]] which received a Latin Grammy nomination and Irreplacable whose Spanish version ranked on the music charts. My idea right now is that for a Spanish or Portuguese version of a song to be in, it has be released as a single. It almost sounds simple, except I didn't factor ABBA's Spanish version of their songs which they released as singles or even Madonna's "You'll See" in Spanish. I want to point that I don't feel strongly about including Spanish/Portuguse covers of a song recorded in another language. Examples being Prince Royce's cover of [[Stand by Me]]. So what are some good suggestions on how to handle this situation? [[User:Magiciandude|Erick]] ([[User talk:Magiciandude|talk]]) 09:35, 3 December 2013 (UTC)}}

The original press release stated the maximum speed of the Eurofighter as Mach 2.0+ in 2003. Several magazines and other sources have reprinted this figure in the interim. These do not class as secondary sources in my view because:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:USEPRIMARY#.22Secondary.22_is_not_another_way_to_spell_.22good.22 From from the above: "Characteristics of a secondary source: "A secondary source usually provides analysis, commentary, evaluation, context, and interpretation. It is this act of going beyond simple description, and telling us the meaning behind the simple facts, that makes them valuable to Wikipedia." The magazines in question fulfill none of the criteria mentioned in the sentence above wrt the Typhoon Mach figure and have remained stagnant (not updated) since 2003.

Furthermore https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:USEPRIMARY#Not_a_matter_of_counting_the_number_of_links_in_the_chain: "Consider the simple example above: the original proclamation is a primary source. Is the book necessarily a secondary source? The answer is: not always. If the book merely quotes the proclamation (such as re-printing a section in a sidebar or the full text in an appendix, or showing an image of the signature or the official seal on the proclamation) with no analysis or commentary, then the book is just a newly printed copy of the primary source, rather than being a secondary source. The text and images of the proclamation always remain primary sources."

More recently the Austrian Airforce has quoted the maximum speed of the Typhoon as 2,495kph at 10,975m. This calculates as Mach 2.35 at ISA conditions (see DRN link). Furthermore this capability has been confirmed by the manufacturer Eurofighter GmbH as possible with a given fuel load etc. (see DRN link). In light of the fact that these are two good primary sources and in the absence of any true secondary sources (with independent analysis or verification of the top speed capability) I move that the speed be changed to Mach 2.35, or at least noted that 2,495kph at 10,975m corresponds to Mach 2.35 at ISA for the benefit of users not familiar with the calculation.  At present the article reads "''Maximum speed: At altitude: Mach 2+ (2,495kph at 10,975m)''".[[User:Z07x10|Z07x10]] ([[User talk:Z07x10|talk]]) 14:46, 6 November 2013 (UTC)}}

[[MOS:COMMA]] currently states:

* In geographical references that include multiple levels of subordinate divisions (e.g., city, state/province, country), a comma separates each element and follows the last element (except at the end of a sentence). [[WP:DATEFORMAT|Dates]] in month–day–year format also require a comma after the day and after the year (except at the end of a sentence). In both cases, the last element is treated as [[Wikipedia:COPYEDIT#Parenthetical comma|parenthetic]].

This overlooks that the final comma may be superseded by other punctuation.  There is also heated debate regarding whether the final comma is needed when the place name or date is used as an adjective, although there is a general consensus that such constructions should be avoided (for example, see [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (geographic names)#Commas_in_metro_areas|Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (geographic names) § Commas in metro areas]]).  It is therefore proposed to replace the above section with the following:

* In geographical references that include multiple divisions (e.g., city, state/province, country), a comma separates each element and follows the last element. [[WP:DATEFORMAT|Dates]] in month–day–year format also require a comma after the day and after the year. In either case, a comma is not required after the last element when the place name or date appears by itself (as in a title or list) or is followed by other punctuation (such as a full stop, dash, parenthesis, etc.).

Please see the arguments in the thread above and indicate with "support adding" or "oppose adding" as well as your opinion:

''' Income inequality '''

[[File:Inequality-by-Kenworthy.png|thumb|200px|Changes in real US incomes for the top 1%, middle 60%, and bottom 20% from 1979 through 2007.<ref>Kenworthy, L. (August 20, 2010) [http://lanekenworthy.net/2010/07/20/the-best-inequality-graph-updated/ "The best inequality graph, updated"] ''Consider the Evidence''</ref>]]
Should EllenCT's proposed image to the right be added to Income, poverty, and wealth, replacing the long-standing (by several years) housing development image and alongside a similar image also showing growing economic divides? Or should it be traded out with the other graph while keeping the housing image? What do you think of the emphasis the section currently places on income inequality?
:'''Oppose adding''' based on my arguments above. [[User:Cadiomals|Cadiomals]] ([[User talk:Cadiomals|talk]]) 13:30, 1 December 2013 (UTC)}}

It's clear that oxygen inhibits growth of obligate anaerobes, but it's not clear if oxygen does kill them.

At the beginning of the article is written:

:''Obligate anaerobes are microorganisms that live and grow in the absence of molecular oxygen; '''some of these''' are killed by oxygen.''
 
But below the picture it says:

:''2: '''Obligate anaerobes are''' poisoned by oxygen, so they gather at the bottom of the tube where the oxygen concentration is lowest.''

So are all obligate anaerobes killed by oxygen or not?? In other words: Are there any existing obligate anaerobes that just stop growth but aren't killed?

Thanks for your help and for correcting the article. --[[Special:Contributions/178.197.226.131|178.197.226.131]] ([[User talk:178.197.226.131|talk]]) 13:35, 8 November 2013 (UTC)}}

The following is a binding RfC to resolve the issue laid out in the "Background" section, below. Please only edit in Comments section or any sections created below it. Do not edit the background or the statements by Ryulong and ChrisGualtieri.

'''''Please stay civil and on topic. The scope of this RfC is strictly the issue of whether anime and manga adaptations from the same franchise should be covered on one page or several. The conduct issues between those debating that question are <u>NOT</u> within the scope of this RfC.'''''

'''Background=== 
{{u|Ryulong}} and {{u|ChrisGualtieri}} are both long time editors in the area of [[manga]] and [[anime]]. Over the past several months their disagreement over whether anime and manga adaptations of the same work should share a page or whether they should be split into multiple articles has evolved into a series of increasingly heated arguments, which has led to several AN/I threads and has poisoned the atmosphere around manga and anime articles on Wikipedia. It is important to note that while the primary disputants in this case are are Ryulong and ChrisGualtieri, there are several other editors that frequently comment in these disputes, and that some those editors have made comments that have further inflamed the issue.

The purpose of this RfC is to resolve the ''content dispute'' that is at the heart of this, with the understanding that if that is resolved, the user conduct issues will fade. Both Ryulong and ChrisGualtieri have agreed to hold a binding RfC to resolve the issue. The purpose of this RfC is <u>not</u> to discuss the user conduct issues. While it may seem that the content dispute and the conduct issues are inseparable, but they are. Shifting the focus of this RfC to a 'who wronged whom' discussion will doom the RfC to fail and will do nothing to solve the underlying content dispute, which will continue to cause problems.

The first section of this RfC will consist of statements by Ryulong and ChrisGualtieri that lay out their position on the argument. The second section will be a discussion of their positions, and of any other positions that editors have, with the aim of selecting a resolution to the question that as a broad consensus. If a clear consensus develops for one position or the other, that will be the resolution. If a consensus fails to develop for one position or another, the community should begin drafting compromise proposals and seeing if any of those develop consensus. 
 
Many of the editors involved in this dispute have spent months bickering, and it has become 'personal' for some of them. Because of the potential for this to spiral out of control, the RfC will be carefully monitored to ensure that this does not become another forum for continued interpersonal attacks. Ryulong and ChrisGualtieri have agreed to limit their participation in the second section of this RfC in order to head off the possibility of additional fighting. Please feel free to ask them for clarifications to the points they made in the first section, but don't ask them to comment on each other's positions. That's the place of the larger community to discuss.

'''Statement by ChrisGualtieri'''

While it may seem to be good idea to keep many anime and manga articles together, it is not always ideal. Would you combine all notable adaptations of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet to one page? What of Hamlet? What of Harry Potter? What of Lord of the Rings? What of Spiderman, Transformers, the list goes on. Each article needs its own [[WP:N|notability]] to stand alone, but that is not questioned in this dispute. It is the presumption that notable adaptations are not worthy of detailed coverage, and that goes against the [[WP:DETAIL|detail]] portion of [[WP:SS|summary style]]. The dispute is not on cases of small adaptations of 13 or 26 episodes, but sprawling and multi-million and multi-billion dollar franchises. The Dragon Ball manga has sold more books than all 300+ Star Wars novels put together; over 230 million volumes in total. The anime adaptations of Dragon Ball comprise 500 episodes; which have aired in over 50 nations and dubbed no less than 20 times. But not all adaptations are faithful; the anime of Bleach has over 100 episodes of original content – not covered in the manga – and whose plot and production was non-existent because it was deemed unnecessary. Its removal results in a lost of knowledge and the needless limitation of one topic so that the original dominates the coverage or mixes the two together into an incomprehensible and jarring form.

Once notability is established, the adaptation's differences, cast, production, music, and reception are all worthy of discussion. Currently, the all-in-one pages result in the adaptation's coverage being cut or removed until only a “list of episodes” remains. A separate page resolves this content and focus conflict. While there is no need to have splits for every adaptation, actively barring separate articles is bad for Wikipedia and it has been the Anime and Manga WikiProject's stance for years. Even if you do not care about anime or manga – these articles contain many of Wikipedia's most popular pages and the adaptation is the most familiar media to the international audience. Support separate articles for notable adaptations so that they can be detailed and comprehensive without being cut down to a mere subtopic of the original media.

'''Statement by Ryulong'''

My position is fairly simple. For ease in presenting topics on anime and manga that only differ in whether one is on paper or on television, a single page is all that is really needed to discuss them. It is not necessary to produce two articles on what is essentially the same topic because there are reliable sources that contain critical reception of one form of the media rather than the other when it is rarely ever critical reception that applies only to that form (such as animation quality or artwork). The only reason that there exists this divide in sources (from what I have seen) is that the anime version becomes more popular in English, thus producing the plethora of sources that solely discuss the English version of the anime adaptation. This should not be a metric by which a new article is produced from what was previously a two-in-one page. And what is left finds its place at the character lists (casting), chapter lists (publishing dates), and episode lists (broadcast dates and for some reason theme songs).

There are also issues concerning the idea of a "franchise page" which I disagree with, but I am not sure about ChrisGualtieri's current stance on this as it is not addressed in his statement on this RFC.

'''Comments'''

'''''Please stay civil and on topic. The scope of this RfC is strictly the issue of whether anime and manga adaptations from the same franchise should be covered on one page or several. The conduct issues between those debating that question are <u>NOT</u> within the scope of this RfC.'''''

* I am going remain neutral on this matter, as I suggested and coordinated this RfC, so it would be improper for me to take sides now. I would, however, like to make a few observations. 1) The area in dispute here seems rather small. The disagreement isn't over ''every'' franchise, but only the ''largest'' franchises - the ones with several series of manga or anime within the same franchise, or several manga adaptations of the same series, and so on. I'm not an expert in the area, but there can't be more than a few dozen that are that big. With that in mind, I think it's important to realize that this isn't an RfC on the entirety of manga and anime coverage, but rather of a definable subsection of it. 2) Despite all of the bickering, it's clear that there is a mutual respect and a desire for reconciliation between Ryulong and ChrisGualtieri, which is the biggest reason why I think such an RfC has the possibility of being successful. As I said at the AN/I thread, these are both long time, positive contributors that are looking to do what they view as the best for the project, and they both have solid rationales for their beliefs. I would ask that participants keep these things in mind, and give the issue the consideration it deserves. Simply regurgitating old arguments will get us nowhere, the involved parties, all of them, not just Ryulong and ChrisGualtieri, need to put aside their animosity and look for a solution here.

So when I rewrote the article (it was poorly written in some parts and close paraphrasing in the rest; none of the original prose remains), I used "Bohai" instead of "Balhae" when describing the kingdom in this article. While the article might be called [[Balhae]], both Balhae and Bohai are correct, with Balhae being the transliteration from Korean and Bohai being the transliteration from Chinese. While it is true that the [[Liao Dynasty]] had influence in both what is now North Korea and what is now the PRC, the Khitans are associated much more closely with Chinese history (as that was their primary military, cultural, and political focus, and they made far greater inroads there), rather than Korean history. As such, contemporary English language sources use the Chinese transliteration, Bohai, in the context of Liao-Bohai/Balhae relations. That's why I used Bohai, not Balhae. {{u|Historiographer}} disagrees, and since we're unable to edit back and forth any further without getting into an edit war, and neither of us seem liable to drop the issue, I'd like to put it up for broader discussion.

The text was recently changed to "A number of organizations including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Food and Drug Administration have concerns that e-cigs might increase addition to and use of nicotine and tobacco products in children[20][21] although the existing evidence contradicts this.[22]" based on this unpublished study by ASH [http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_891.pdf]. IMO ASH should not be used to refute the CDC and FDA.

This paper states "It is unknown if the availability of ENDS serves to alter use of cigarettes among current smokers or leads to increased initiation among non-using youth. Nevertheless, there is concern that ENDS use may undermine social norms about tobacco (Mejia, Ling, & Glantz, 2010), serve as a starter product for cigarettes among youth, or delay smoking cessation among current adolescent" {{cite journal|last=Camenga|first=DR|coauthors=Delmerico, J; Kong, G; Cavallo, D; Hyland, A; Cummings, KM; Krishnan-Sarin, S|title=Trends in use of electronic nicotine delivery systems by adolescents.|journal=Addictive behaviors|date=2013 Sep 17|pmid=24094920}}

And this overview agrees that their is little data one way or the other "However, there is little objective information concerning the safety, abuse potential and efficacy of these products.12 Other concerns have been expressed, including that some flavours may appeal to children, that ENDS may become a gateway to smoking or to nicotine addiction, that they undermine smoke-free laws, delay a smoker’s decision to quit or might be used in conjunction with drug misuse.2,3, 13, 14" [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3215262/].

Hi. I'll make this short and quick. I'm still struggling to see how useful the {{tlx|Orphan}} tag is. It's big, it's ugly, and it concerns a very very minor problem that most of the times does not really have a solution. Some articles are simply about subjects that have not been mentioned in any other Wikipedia articles. As the VERY large backlog in [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Orphanage]] makes quite clear. Forcing editors to link them or add them even in places where they are only vaguely relevant is not good practice. Neither does it concern any of the readers, but it's them who have to see the tag first thing on the page. If it was a problem on sources, I would understand, as readers should know about it. But not being linked enough is not that serious of a problem to merit defacing an article.

I propose that the tag itself be moved to the talk page to minimize its impact on the article's readability.

Note that I do not know how this can be accomplished (probably by a bot?) Neither do I really have the time to make this a formal proposal, but I'm simply fed up at seeing it all the time for otherwise perfectly fine articles. What does everyone else think?--&nbsp;<small>[[User:Obsidian Soul|<font color=0>'''O'''</font><font color=gray>BSIDIAN</font>]]</small><font size="3" face =times new roman>†</font><small>[[User talk:Obsidian Soul|<font color=0>'''S'''</font><font color=gray>OUL</font>]]</small> 01:41, 14 November 2013 (UTC)}}

I have looked over this article and it is severely lacking. The references are inadequate, there seems to be an overabundance of non-free images and it appears to be written in a very in-universe style. It is, to my eyes, looking more like a piece from a dedicated wiki rather than a page that belongs on Wikipedia. It needs sorting out, or it may well end up getting deleted sooner or later. I had considered putting it up for deletion, but this seemed a far better route to take.

We are having a hard time coming to a consensus about wether or not we should present graphs about Puerto Rico's economic behavior under García Padilla's tenure. This is common on Wikipedia and is currently done for other heads of government such as:
* '''[[Barack Obama]]''', where [[:File:US EmpStatsBLS Jan09-Feb13.png|a graph shows the unemployment rate under Obama's tenure]], and
* '''[[George W. Bush]]''', where [[:File:Deficits vs. Debt Increases - 2009.png|a graph shows the deficit under Bush's tenure]].

The graphs that were included on this article were created from data published by two reliable sources: the [[Puerto Rico Government Development Bank]] and the [[Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources]]—the only two sources in the whole world that publish such data. This can be obtained from:
* [http://www.gdb-pur.com/economy/documents/15.EAI-2013-10-01.xls] (sheet T01, first table, fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014, months from January to August--tenure of García Padilla as he was sworn in on January 2, 2013) and from
* [http://www.gdb-pur.com/economy/documents/02.PAYROLL-2013-10-01.xls] (sheet T22, first table, fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014, months from January to August--tenure of García Padilla as he was sworn in on January 2, 2013).

Both entities have a backlog of about three months (right now they only show the data until August: [http://www.gdb-pur.com/economy/pr-monthly-economic-indicators-time-series.html]).

The graphs were created from the following data:

{| class="wikitable"
! Month
! EIA
! Deviation (cumulative; when compared to base)
|-
| December (previous governor; serves as base of comparison)
| 131.4

I'm not making this up. The data is available at http://www.gdb-pur.com/economy/documents/15.EAI-2013-10-01.xls

A similar process was done for [[Barack Obama]] with an archived discussion available at [[Talk:Barack Obama/Archive 77]].

Hi.

There is a discussion about the inclusion criteria for the items of the associated article. It is a comparison of software article. The main editors involved dispute are [[User:Codename Lisa]] (the editor writing this) and [[User:Lexein]] (not to be confused with Lexin). Currently, there is no consensus between us except that there is an inclusion threshold.

User:Lexein's opinion is, to quote directly:
<blockquote>Please add only entries with articles, or add inline citations of multiple independent reliable sources for verification of claims made.</blockquote>
<blockquote>This list does not [[User talk:Codename Lisa#"Violations"|"violate"]] [[WP:NOTDIR]], because 
*The lead sentences of NOTDIR are worded as ''descriptive'', not prescriptive. If interpreted as ''policy'', NOTDIR wipes out [[WP:CSC#2]] entirely. I do not believe those sentences are worded to be interpreted as the core policy, only as preface and recommendation (not demand), for the purpose of assisting in avoiding totally indiscriminate lists. This is quite obviously not indiscriminate, though it is dynamic.
*I believe these sentences are flawed, because they do not reference the ''actual widespread community consensus practice'': CSC#2. 
*Further, I do not believe this list "violates" as a ''directory'' ("Directories, directory entries, electronic program guide, or a resource for conducting business"), as I've explained above, because nobody would view this as a "directory" (printed out without title) if asked "List, directory, or comparison?".
</blockquote>

User:Codename Lisa's opinion is:
:Every item must have an associated Wikipedia article because:
:*{{section link|What Wikipedia is not|Wikipedia is not a directory}} (WP:NOTDIR) allows Wikipedia to index and organizes its own contents however it sees fit (therefore, items with article are allowed) but says Wikipedia is not a directory, a [[comparison shopping website]], sales catalog or lists without contextual backings similar to those listed in [[Open Directory Project]] or [[Wikipedia:Alternative outlets|Alternative outlets]] (therefore, items without an article are not allowed.)
:*''Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not'' is a [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|fundamental policy]] that takes precedence any other policy, guideline or essay. In reading of every other policy, guideline or essay, this antecedent should not be denied.
:*WP:NOTDIR does not wipes out [[WP:CSC#2]]. It surely restricts it but does not wipe it out. See examples given in WP:CSC. (What if it did? It doesn't, but what if? Well, WP:NOT is fundamental policy and CSC is just a guideline. It is CSC that should adjust itself to WP:NOT.)
:Comparative statements still need a reliable source.

The 'Other areas of Wikipedia' is currently a collection of 6 static links to areas of the 'community' side of the wiki, one of which is already linked in the side bar (community portal). I propose that we use this area like our other featured content sections, and shine a spotlight on areas that would otherwise get little exposure. Examples of the types of featured areas would be policy (such as 5 pillars), editing advice/tutorials, areas to make proposals, areas to request articles, how to start an article, find help (reference desk), information about WikiProjects, how to register an account, how to upload a photograph, how to nominate featured content, etc.

Like other featured content, items would be rotated at an interval to be determined by the community, and blurbs would have to be written and approved before content would be entered into the rotation. The goal of this program would be to show readers that there are simple ways to get involved, and to drive traffic to areas that might otherwise be unnoticed by our readership. --[[User:NickPenguin|<font color="darkgreen">Nick</font>]][[User talk:NickPenguin|<font color="darkblue">Penguin</font>]]<sub>([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|<font color="blue">'''contribs'''</font>]])</sub> 17:25, 12 December 2013 (UTC)}}

Right, rather than get in an edit war about the lead, I am posting here to gain consensus about what people think. A wee while ago I was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edinburgh&diff=577467894&oldid=577466839 reverted] as I felt the lead contained too much in the way of puffy quasi-promotional material more worthy of a tourism brochure rather than an encyclopedia and had removed it.

Hence, looking at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edinburgh&oldid=582197225 the current version as of today], I'd be proposing removing paragraphs 3 and 5 of the lead, leaving only a sentence about the University and placing it somewhere else in the lead. I am asking for opinions:

We seem to be at a stalemate situation, with one group of editors fully supporting a merge, and another dead against it, and to be frank, it has turned a little nasty.  We really need wider views on this, but I hope any editor wishing to contribute here will take the time to read the previous history and fully take into account the points raised by both sides in the past.  It may be a good idea for us editors who have been most active in the previous discussions to take minimal part in this one, in order to have some fresh opinions given, and to avoid the same spiral we have been going down.  Points that should be addressed should consider whether there is a necessity to have separate articles, or whether a single umbrella article will do, and if multiple articles are deemed necessary, how these should be named with regard to [[WP:UE|the use of Chinese characters in the article titles]].

{{rfcquote|text=
Should we mention Chopin's nationality as Polish or Polish-French? A debate on this has been simmering on for sometime now.

Here are some of the discussions pertaining to this issue
*[[Talk:Frédéric_Chopin/Archive_1#Nationality|Nationality]]
*[[Talk:Frédéric_Chopin/Archive_2#Nationality]] (second discussion)
*[[Talk:Frédéric_Chopin/Archive_3#Nationality|Nationality]] (third discussion)

*[[Talk:Frédéric_Chopin/Archive_11#Nationality_.28one_more_time.29|Nationality (one more time)]]

As [[WP:CCC|consensus has and will always change]], here are some solutions which are being considered for proposal:

*'''Solution A''' - Describe Chopin as Polish in the lead
*'''Solution B''' - Describe Chopin as Polish-French in the lead
*'''Solution C''' - Describe Chopin as Polish and French in the lead
*'''Solution D''' - Describe Chopin as Polish, French-naturalized in the lead
*'''Solution E''' - Do not describe his nationality in the lead. Discuss it in the body of the article.

Please weigh-in, indicating the solution(s) you support using the example format below. Include a brief explanation of your rationale.  Or, alternatively, if you have some idea which hasn't previously been put forward, please let us know!

Modeling the singles template, I suggest that we add a "format" parameter to the albums template. Like in the singles template, where the inclusion of this field highlights the several different forms that songs have been released in the past and continue to be released today, this addition would emphasize that albums are distributed in numerous styles, including the original vinyls, recent CDs and digital downloads, and more "experimental" mobile apps. With this in mind, I find this to be important information that readers should have available at a quick glance.

To make things easier, I'll model the parameter description off of the existing one at the singles infobox: ''"the way that the album was released; i.e. [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]], [[compact disc]], [[Music download|digital download]], [[mobile app]], [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]] (note the piped download link). Separate multiple values using commas or {{tl|Flatlist}}."''

Feel free to support, oppose, or suggest adjustments to this current version; I look forward to the discussion about this proposal. [[User:WikiRedactor|WikiRedactor]] ([[User talk:WikiRedactor|talk]]) 21:37, 21 November 2013 (UTC)}}

Think this needs to got to a RFC if we cant get consensus one way or another then thats where i will take it very shortly. For now these are the two options. The table currently uses a footnote with further explanation re the first doctor and this is what we would use again if going down in universe route. In the real world table it is exactly as laid out and there is already sufficient text in the article to support it. I disagree that we cannot list the War Doctor between Smith and Capaldi as text support statement they appeared concurrently as does the date appeared but again further explanation can be made through footnote as is already the case for first doctor. What cannot continue is edit warring on the basis of take to talk page when there isn't strong consensus for it not to be there.[[User:Blethering Scot|<font color="maroon">Blethering</font>]] [[User talk:Blethering Scot|<font color="green">Scot</font>]] 21:21, 26 November 2013 (UTC)}}

Working off of {{U|Veriss1}}'s cogent comments above, if Etoiles is still interested in improving the article after her block expires, I suggest we start with the Vogue material as I believe that is her biggest complaint. We need to decide (1) whether the material deserves its own section, (2) what material to include, and (3) how the material should be worded. As a subissue to issue #1, if we determine that the material should ''not'' be in a separate section, we need to decide where it should go. I suggest we start with issues #2 and #3 first.

Although I quoted it above, for ease of reference, here is the material currently in the article:

<blockquote>In March 2011, Vogue published a flattering profile of the first lady titled "A Rose in the Desert" authored by veteran fashion writer Joan Juliet Buck. The article was later removed from Vogue's website without editorial comment that spring. Responding to media inquiries about the disappearance of Assad's profile, Vogue’s editor stated that "as the terrible events of the past year and a half unfolded in Syria, it became clear that [Syria's] priorities and values were completely at odds with those of Vogue". After strong public and media reaction to the article, Buck's contract was not renewed with Vogue although she had been employed by the magazine for over 30 years and had been an editor of French Vogue for seven years. The New York Times later reported that the piece was intended as part of a larger Syrian government-sponsored image campaign coordinated by the public relations firm Brown Lloyd James. Buck has since written another article for Newsweek giving an extremely critical account of Asma al-Assad, concluding that she is the "first lady of hell". Separately, Buck's original profile of Assad was satirized in The Philadelphia Inquirer.</blockquote>

Any editor can comment on the above material, but it would be preferable to do so in concrete terms, i.e., remove x sentence, reword y sentence from a to b. No matter how much we may disagree, the discussion must remain civil and respectful.

I'll get things going a little and suggest the following (some paring down and some rewording):

<blockquote>In March 2011, Vogue published a flattering profile of the first lady titled "A Rose in the Desert" authored by fashion writer Joan Juliet Buck. The article was removed from Vogue's website without comment that spring. Responding to media inquiries about its removal, Vogue’s editor stated that "it became clear that [Syria's] priorities and values were completely at odds with those of Vogue". The New York Times later reported that the piece was intended as part of a larger Syrian government-sponsored image campaign coordinated by a public relations firm. Buck later wrote another article for Newsweek giving a critical account of Asma al-Assad.</blockquote>

I mostly ''removed'' material. Notably, I removed the sentence about Buck's contract - the relevance to Asma is too remote. I also eliminated the inflammatory "first lady of hell" quote as unnecessary and Buck's opinion. I also removed the satire of the original profile as again being only remotely relevant to Asma as opposed to Buck. I also left out the name of the PR firm - who cares? It wouldn't bother me also to remove ""coordinated by a public relations firm" as the important Asma aspect is that the piece was part of a Syrian government campaign, not who executed it for the government.

Just as an aside, my recollection is that much of the discussion that occurred a long time ago about this material was a spillover from the Buck article itself, meaning that some editors were more interested in the Buck article and saw the Asma article as a way to augment their views. To some extent, that's emblematic of [[WP:COATRACK]] and shouldn't be permitted, but at Wikipedia one works with consensus, even if one disagrees with it, and the Buck consensus was unfortunately intertwined with the Asma consensus.

'''Proposal''': '''Change the duration of [[WP:BLPPROD|BLPPROD]] from 10 to 7 days.'''

'''Rationale''':  In view of the sensitivity of BLP content, there are possibly sufficient grounds  to reduce the duration to the 7 days as used for standard [[WP:PROD|PROD]]. This also has the merit of simplifying our processes, bringing BLPprod's duration into line with prod and AFD.

'''Background''': 10 days was never a number chosen by solid consensus.  The discussion can be found [[Wikipedia_talk:Proposed_deletion_of_biographies_of_living_people/Archive_2#Length_of_time_before_deletion|here]].  '''At the time no one actually advocated 10 days, and there was quite a bit of support for 7 days, support for 2 weeks, and support for 1 month'''  10 days was chosen as a compromise between the 7 days and the much longer proposed periods. There were no objections and 10 days was adopted.<small>This section modified by [[User:Gigs|Gigs]] ([[User talk:Gigs|talk]]) 18:30, 10 December 2013 (UTC)}}

Some discussions recently have led me to ponder this - do people really think we get editors from tinkering with the main page? Is the potential benefit of this worth the risk of visitors finding a vandalised page? How often is there a beneficial edit to a mainpage featured article (or any featured article for that matter) from an IP?

'''Keep as is (i.e. default is unprotected, with certain pages protected for varying reasons)'''

{{rfcquote|text=
We currently do not have a policy nor a guideline for charts and graphs. We are currently having a difficult time reaching consensus at [[Talk:Alejandro García Padilla]] due to several graphs being included on the article that portray the economic activity and employment during the governor's tenure. The same thing happened with [[Barack Obama]] and [[:File:US EmpStatsBLS Jan09-Feb13.png]] where this graph was discussed at [[Talk:Barack Obama/Archive 77#Labor force participation rate]]. We do the same for [[George W. Bush]] and [[:File:Deficits vs. Debt Increases - 2009.png]]. Unfortunately, as we don't have a guideline specifically for this, we are reaching a stalemate where neither side is right nor wrong.

We need to fix this problem.

We need to move things forward and establish a guideline on how graphs should be prepared; specifically regarding data trends and their sources. We should also take in consideration graphs prepared from data where the data is shown "as is" but the graph per se has not been published by a reliable source. In other words: we have the raw data, but then an editor creates a graph from such raw data even though no one else has published said graph before. For example, [[:File:US EmpStatsBLS Jan09-Feb13.png]] was drawn from raw data extracted from [http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000] & [http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0000000001?output_view=net_1mth] — nobody else in the world has published such graph except us, but the graph can be extrapolated from the raw data published by the reliable source.

This is the only page on all of Wikipedia where this subject is discussed, but as of today, it is merely a project page written back in 2008. Right now, our policies and guidelines do not establish how graphs should or can be prepared {{underline|as an official guideline}} (this page is NOT official as of this writing). Finally, our policies and guidelines do not prohibit creating graphs from [[WP:PRIMARYSOURCES]] but several people are concerned on whether this should be done on [[WP:BLP]]s or not.

Relevant policies and guidelines for this discussion include:

{{col-list|3|
* [[WP:GUIDELINE]]
* [[WP:NPOV]]
* [[WP:OR]]
* [[WP:PERTINENCE]]
* [[WP:PILLARS]]
* [[WP:PRIMARYSOURCES]]
* [[WP:PROPOSAL]]
* [[WP:RELIABLESOURCES]]
* [[WP:SYNTHESIS]]
}}

Let's start a discussion on this RFC to reach consensus and set up the way for future editors.

The question is: '''how should graphs on Wikipedia be created?'''

===Background'''

For the past few days, trolls have been persistently vandalising a number of highly visible templates with official-looking  ''advertisements'' and other explicit images. For example, see these two screenshots - [http://imgur.com/3pVIZEf] [http://i.imgur.com/UiUP29y.png]. Every time one of these vandalisms occur, it takes quite some time for editors to revert, as well as causing issues with purging, which make the templates be displayed even after they're edited back to their original form.

So far the following templates have been vandalised, almost all of them used in multiple highly viewed articles (Number of transclusions [[User:TheOriginalSoni/sandbox6|available]])-
{{Div col|3}}
* {{tl|SEP}}
* {{tl|Country topics}}
* {{tl|Flagdeco}}
* {{tl|Native name}}
* {{tl|Infobox event}}
* {{tl|Use American English}}
* {{tl|Hid}}
* {{tl|Noodle}}
* {{tl|Infobox Chinese/Footer}}
* {{tl|NOCin2014WinterOlympics}}
* {{tl|Navbox Canada}}
* {{tl|Religion in South Africa}}
* {{tl|Flagu/core}}
* {{tl|Notelist-ua}}
* {{tl|Vi icon}}
* {{tl|Editorial}}
* {{tl|Cite speech}}
* {{tl|Ifarticle}}
* {{tl|Citation needed span}}
* {{tl|Politics series sidebar}}
* {{tl|Bar chart}}
{{Div col end}}

As is visible, all of these templates are either transcluded in many pages, or are transcluded in some pages which have a lot of viewers, making it a deliberate attempt to cause disruption for a large number of our readers. 

Relevant discussion can also be found at [[Wikipedia:ANI#Advertisement.3F.3F|ANI Post1]], [[Wikipedia:ANI#Offensive.2FControversial_Advertisement_.28possible_hacking.3F.29|ANI Post2]], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&oldid=587562669#Another_instance_of_template_vandalism ANI Post3] [[Wikipedia:VPR#Template_vandalism_with_images|Village Pump Post]].

There has been one abuse filter at work but given how the vandals appear to know Wikipedia enough to know which templates to attack, it probably would not hold them off for long, even if it does. Meanwhile, it misleads a significant number of our readers (See [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Advertising_program&action=history the number of edits at this supposed "Discussion" page where the readers were directed to]. Also see the now deleted Wikipedia_talk:Advertising_on_Wikipedia page on testwiki.)

'''Proposal'''

To deal with this vandalism, I propose the following steps to be taken to immediate effect-
# The Pending Changes (See [[Wikipedia:Protection_policy#Comparison_table|comparison table]]) protection level be enabled for Template space.
## To allow this to be effective for Templates, [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=59102 59102] has been filed at bugzilla.
# PC1 will be enabled for all high-risk templates. If the vandalism persists, this will be converted to PC2
## For both these protections, template editors will have the same rights as reviewers
## [[Special:PendingChanges]] can be used to allow for effective maintenance of any pending changes on the templates.
## The high-risk will include the following templates. More pages may be added to the high risk templates on further discussion
### Templates transcluded on more than 250 pages
### Sidebars with collapsible lists (Example - {{tl|Politics}})
### Expansive navboxes. (Example - {{tl|Chess}})
### Any templates transcluded in any of the above

'''The Fallout'''

* The immediate very significant advantage for this will be to deal with these recent vandalisms. Any other such template vandalisms in the future will also be dealt with.
* A number of edits made to template by inexperienced users break things. This would allow an extra set of eyes on changes made to the templates.
* The load for reviewers and template editors would increase, who have to monitor the PendingChanges page.
* There will be some collateral good-faith IP editors who will require the edits to be confirmed by TE or reviewers.
